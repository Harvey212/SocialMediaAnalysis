1,Outbound flight FRA/PRN A319. 2 hours 10 min flight. I thought drinks/snacks for sale but sandwich soft drinks were served complimentary. Inbound flights SKP/LJU/FRA CRJ900. each 1 hour 30 min flight. Skyshop menu was in a seat pocket and drinks/snacks were for sale. All flight crews were friendly. Security check at the Ljubljana airport for transit passengers was chaos however it's possible to go to a gate within 30min.
2,Our flight from Rhodes to Athens on route to Heathrow was cancelled with sufficient notice given. To fix this they got us tickets on Olympic leaving the same day just a couple of hours earlier. Flight from Athens to Heathrow was very pleasant and we arrived on time. Staff were all friendly and willing to assist even the office staff in regards to our cancelled flights were very helpful.
3,Athens to Larnaca economy. Early morning flight. Departing punctually serves simple breakfast. Crew friendly and efficient.
4,MUC-SKG on 17th of Dec. One-way. New A320 with new style of seats quite uncomfortable though. Friendly and nice crew. A hot meal was served in this short flight and drinks. However passengers didn't obey at all to the new cabin baggage rules causing space problems and minor delays and the crew did nothing about it. Rules should be more strictly enforced.
5,Flew London to Athens and then on to Ioannina and then from Ioannina to Athens and back to London. Great flight new and comfortable planes professional crew good meals and snacks. Great airline with great product. When and if I ever go to Greece again I will fly with Aegean.
6,Very good experience. Check-in and boarding were quick and efficient. The airplane is very clean and the cabin crew were friendly and helpful. There is a good variety of food sold on the airplane.
7,"Flew from Belfast to Gatwick, the plane was oldish and not very comfortable, I felt really squashed where I was sitting. Plane took off on time and arrived a few minutes early on the other side, so no complaints there. Boarding was relatively quick and the cabin crew were personable, one passenger complained of being ill during the flight and was attended to with care and attention. A hassle free trip but they do need more space between seats on their planes, this is a national airline, not a budget one."
8,"I had a very pleasant experience flying with Aer Lingus. Although the business class is not up to par with most other airlines, it is far from bad and the service was great - Irish hospitality at its best! "
9,FCO-ATH-LCA-ATH all in business as using points. Easy check-in. Quality of meals and wine excellent for short . flights. Attentive staff -although as first two flights only 3 of us out of possible 8 to be expected. Really did run a separate bus on arrival for just 3 business class passengers at ATH and LCA.
10,I had a flight on October 14 going from ATH to HER and back upgrading my economy ticket to business by spending some miles on the aegean miles program. I had an excellent light meal the personnel of the aircraft was gentle and smiley. The seat was the same like the economy class but it was comfortable enough.
11,I flew on October 5th then on to Mykonos. I then flew to Athens and then to Kos. On the 16th from Kalymnos to Athens and back to Mykonos and then on 22nd Mykonos - Athens - to Irakio Crete and then from Crete back to Athens. I must say I have had some excellent flights with Aegean. All flights on time and an excellent meal from London to Athens and this being Economy. On the internal flights you were offered a soft drink and snack. Cabin crews were extremely professional and I look forward to next October. The only downside is that: 1) They did not show any films or music available on the London flight and 2) When I booked in March I could not book the November flight home because tickets were not available so BA flew me home. I knocked a point off their food and beverages as they don't serve a gin and tonic in Economy. AS I have said I look forward to flying with them next year but they have changed the flight times to Mykonos from Athens from 7 pm to 6.30 pm which makes life difficult so they might lose this customer.
12,"SFO-DUB, LHR-DUB-SFO. Ground staff excellent. On time departure. Flight staff were just going through the motions and seemed as though they couldn't care less about the passengers. Seating was tight, but bearable. Inflight entertainment was pretty good. Meals were not so good and beverage service was below standard. Had issues with passenger behind us that allowed their child to continuously kick the back of our seat. We asked the mother once of the problem yet the child continued. Asked again to please have your child stop the kicking. Third time was enough and flight crew intervened and helped settle the problem. A cookie for the kicking child and a glass of wine for us. Very odd situation but handled OK by crew. Overall the flight seemed short handed, stressed and just did not want to do their job. Return flight back was like night and day. Our baggage was well above the limit but nothing was said and they checked us in with no questions. Both flights were on time. Ground staff friendly and helpful, cabin crew were friendly, helpful and outgoing. Meals were actually tasty and there were non-stop beverage runs. The crew came across happy and willing to please the passengers. I got on the plane dreading the flight but departed with a positive attitude. Seating is tight though. I recommend Aer Lingus as an alternative airlines if you are looking for a budget alternative to flying."
13,"Excellent friendly service. Able to fly in and out of Cardiff when other flights were cancelled due to fog. Maybe more expensive than alternatives, but reliable. Preferred airline on the Cardiff-Dublin route."
14,"JFK-SNN-LHR, FCO-DUB-JFK. The first leg of this trip, JFK-SNN, was operated by Air Contractors (I actually think this was the best flight out of the 4). The Boeing 757 cabin was clean. There were pillows and blankets on each seat. The IFE was sufficient for a ~5 hour flight. There was a meal 1-1.5 hours after takeoff (Chicken or Beef). It was okay and what one would expect of an airline meal. SNN-LHR and FCO-DUB were on A320s. The planes were clean but the seats were a little bit tight. There were no IFE on both flights and they charged for food and beverage. DUB-JFK on an A330 dual aisle plane. No pillow and blanket at my seat but they had blankets available for the passengers. The IFE was again sufficient for 7 hour flight. There was a meal after takeoff and a light snack before landing. The boarding process on all 4 flights were effective and all 4 flights left on time. The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. The check in staff at FCO T1 was not but can't really fault them on that."
15,This was my third flight with Aegean in the last three years. I had pleasant experiences with my other two but wanted to reconfirm consistency before I rated this airline. Travelled LHR to ATH this time. Plane was clean and comfortable (for a 3 hour or so flight). My compliments to the staff. As in past flights they very pleasant warm and professional. Food served was as good as can be expected.
16,10/5 Sunday flight Dublin to LHR. Went to book luggage in and was grabbed and asked if I wanted to be put on the earlier flight which was good. I had previously paid for a seat upfront but only got row 9 in the reorg which was odd as there were spare seats on the earlier flight. Bad news - loads of planes leaving at that time so really only gained about half an hour but hey not their fault. Usual problem though - people with too much luggage and no idea of how to stow on board. They did weigh some and grab some but I feel they need to monitor this when people get on the plane as some people really are quite selfish and clueless. Also Aer Lingus passengers take forever getting on or off a plane which actually does matter if you have trains and buses to get. However cheaper than Ryanair and quite pleasant.
17,SKG - ATH and JMK - SKG in early August. Outbound flight was 15 minutes late. Check-in was fast on both flights clean airplanes nice FA fast baggage claim. Overall a pleasant experience.
18,Kos-Athens-LHR on October 1st at 19.10hrs. Very professional service. The airline offered sweets on take-off small snack and drink on Kos-Athens which is just a 40 minute flight! The drinks service are repeated twice on Athens-LHR flight and the meals are adequate. Well worth Â£70 one way and into Heathrow! I would definitely fly them again. Seating is okay for 3 hours 30 minutes and flight seems to go fast as the cabin crew are constantly busy with the passengers. Probably a budget IFE system needs adding for a little more enjoyment!
19,Havana - Cayo Coco return. A one hour flight with an old ATR42 turboprop. Seats surprisingly comfortable and we were offered a free drink plus candy onboard. Nothing special but we arrived on time.
20,I traveled from Munich to Boston in early January 2015. The experience at Munich airport was very poor particularly the passport control line which was 45 minutes of unrestrained and uncontrolled pushing and shoving. Probably not Aer Lingus' fault but still a poor start. I had paid for a business class ticket over the internet. Did not find out until getting on the plane that the first part of the trip (Munich to Dublin) was economy as there are no business class seats on the plane. Typical economy experience. The actual business class portion of the trip (Dublin to Boston) was excellent. However the fare (which looked reasonable initially) in retrospect seemed far too high given that 3 hours of the 9 hour trip were actually not business class. I had a medical issue that caused me to book the business class ticket so I was really horrified at the unexpected 3 hours in economy which I had bought the business class ticket specifically to avoid.
21,On a return journey to Dublin from Lanzarote (flight 779) I had fallen unwell 15 minutes post takeoff. The urge to throw-up a feeling not welcomed by most especially not at 30000+ altitude was overwhelming and a sense of unwanted panic set in. Luckily I was accompanied by my boyfriend whom along with the diligent and empathetic flight crew got me back on track for the remainder of the flight. Frequently asking if I was ok or whether I needed anything was a small but oh so grand gesture which made such a positive difference.
22,MAD-ATH-JMK return. The only downside is that all flights departed a minimum of 30 mins late. On the good side: check in fast and easy nice clean and comfortable aircraft. Great attentive FA food served all sectors along with drinks. Baggage short on belt after arrival. Will fly them back to Greece.
23,Traveled on Aegean twice this week ATH-HER RT and ATH-MAD. All flights on time crews were polite and professional. I fly economy everywhere and expect uncomfortable seats (they were) but while I don't like it realize that's the way economy is so if flights are on time I'm satisfied. Aegean even supplied a meal in coach for the ATH-MAD flight which no USA airline does. I would fly again with Aegean and recommend.
24,Rome to Athens June 23 2014. Flight was on-time comfortable seat spacing nice meal friendly and attentive staff. Would fly them again.
25,April 15th flight 108 return 26th Apr flight 105. My mother and I flew from JFK to Dublin and return. We were in economy from JFK to DUB and in Premier class on the return trip. Both were great experiences and on Aer Lingus new A330. The food was excellent in both cabins. We opted for the succulent steal ($18) in Economy and it was delicious. Crew were lovely. On return we were in the new Premier class cabin. The crew the food the service was terrific. You really could not ask for more.
26,Sunday flight 18.00 from Dublin to Heathrow. Late boarding apparently due to inbound plane being late which is odd as it arrived on time. Then the most ridiculous shambles of boarding that took forever. If people have paid for seats then they should get on first especially as some people are greedy with hand luggage and seem incapable of stowing it correctly. Finally after a good wait I got to get on the plane to find the lady on my row had blocked an entire area by putting her case in the wrong way round! Why is this not monitored? Its about time this boarding procedure was improved upon. Its the same old story. If its a full plane supervise them and get people to board both front and back!
27,Travelled with Aegean Airlines from Barcelona to Athens. Flight was delayed leaving Barcelona however still managed to arrive in Athens on time. Excellent cabin service provided by attentive and polite flight attendants. Can't complain especially with the hot meal and free alcoholic beverage provided in economy class. Wish Aegean offered long haul routes to North America!
28,You go up. You go down. Flight is over. This 20 min flight from Athens to Mykonos on an A320 does what it needs to do get you to your destination.
29,"25/8/2014 A3 381 19.55 (L). I was checked in for 4A. It was impossible to see the screens which showed the ""safety briefing'"". I think the business class curtains prevented us from seeing the screen. A design problem and very important."
30,From London to Dublin. The short haul flight was on time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Ground staff at Heathrow should improve their skills. She asked me to check-in my big suitcase at the boarding gate because she could not print the luggage tag for me - it was too late. I went back to the check-in counter at the time she announced. Finally I was stopped by security due to the liquid in my big suitcase. I missed the flight and I was o/b the next flight.
31,MUC-SKG A3 503 July 22. Efficient check-in use of Lufthansa Business Class lounge (chaotic). Aircraft gate at the far end of the terminal had to walk a lot. Aircraft A320 smart neat clean. Cockpit briefing rather informative. Business class cabin crew (one flying attendant dedicated to four passengers) very satisfactory polite communicative professional. Seating pitch satisfactory - mediocre width (middle seat unoccupied - turned to table). Lavatory clean. Full satisfactory hot meal (choice of main course) with a Mediterranean accent freshly brewed espresso coffee. Actually no in flight entertainment - drop down overhead TV screens with safety instructions and flight path information. Arrived on time business class passengers departed first and transported to the terminal with a dedicated bus. Baggage (Priority labelled) were the first to arrive. Aegean airlines is rightfully voted as one of Europe's top regional airlines.
32,JIK-ATH-LHR on 11 August 2014. Return flight after week in Ikaria. Aegean flight left a few minutes late but made up time although sadly had to stack for 45 minutes at Heathrow. Excellent legroom and seat comfort. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of the meal provided and the drinks so much more than so-called cheaper airlines. Would definitely fly Aegean again. Only downside was the failure of UK Border Agency to have sufficient staff at the immigration desks at Terminal 2.
33,We flew from Ireland with our 9 month old baby and I was 29 weeks pregnant the staff were great we had flown to Ireland with a different carrier but because of the lack of facilities for our little one we decided to let our return trip expire and book new flights with Aer Lingus there is nothing bad I can say about this airline they make you feel comfortable and were so good with our little one we were even given a bassinet for him to sleep in. I highly recommend to anyone with small children.
34,Domestic flights: Athens-Kerkira (Corfu) on a A319 aircraft and Ioannina-Athens on a Bombardier DHC-8-400Q (operated by Olympic Air). Excellent service on-time performance and very polite staff.
35,JMK-ATH-LHR. A3 377/A3 608 7 Aug 2014. Mykonos - Athens sector operated by Olympic Air Dash 800 aircraft. Clean inside and out and welcomed on board by very polite cabin crew. Only 2 Flight Attendants for a 20 minute flight. Departed on time and despite the fact that it was such a short flight a full drink service was offered with a variety of soft drinks napkins ice and a bag of peanuts and everyone was served. Upon landing in ATH the goodbye and thanks you greeting was polite with a smile. An excellent flight. 3 hour layover at Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport Athens was a breeze. Was given an invite to the Aegean Business Lounge on the A side of the departure terminal which was comfortable with the usual drinks and snacks available and regularly topped up. Nice clean lounge with a view of both runways. ATH-LHR Aegean Business. Departed ATH with 15 minute delay clean Airbus A321-200 aircraft. Good PA announcements by Purser and Captain. Comfortable leather seats with middle seat free. Drink service and peanuts after take off with hot towel service. Menu was provided with a choice of 2 hot main meals of chicken or swordfish with a delicious salmon entree and a selection of delicious Greek desserts. A good choice of wines including award winning Greek varieties plus the usual soft after dinner and a good selection of teas and coffees. Hot towel service again before landing. Landed on time. A very impressive service offered by Aegean. Have no hesitation about using them again.
36,Flew from Rome FCO to ATH 2 hour flight but had a large selection of drinks lovely meal then tea or coffee after dinner. The staff were charming and helpful no delays at all the check in staff were informative and efficient telling us where to go with our rucksacks (apparently they're awkward shape so go in the 'oversized baggage' section). We were so efficient getting off the plane we beat our luggage to the conveyor belt. Would definitely recommend this airline to anyone.
37,I fly LGW-DUB-LGW every fortnight. The crew are always extremely friendly considering it is 06.50am and 20.50 on the return. The service is great and they always smile & welcome everyone on board unlike the other Irish airline. However one major concern from the end of March '15 the 06.50 flight will cease to operate and the first flight of the day to Dublin will be at 09.10 which is useless for those of us going to work in Dublin.
38,LHR-ATH-LHR. Flight over very uncomfortable as it was a smaller plane than usual and absolutely no leg room. No inflight entertainment which is essential for a nervous flyer. Seating comfort was better on return trip but Aegean have ceased inflight films and replaced them with extremely repetitive tourist films and no radio/music. Very disappointing. Having flown with Aegean on this route for many years I am now reconsidering.
39,Madrid - Mykonos with a change of plane in Athens we left Madrid just after midnight. The plane was new and clean the service was excellent and what a treat to have a hot meal on a European flight. On leaving the plane at Athens we were told to contact the ground staff immediately as we had a very short connection time. We did so and the ground staff sent us onto the same bus as everybody else! Luckily the airport was not busy at 5 a.m. and we easily caught the flight to Mykonos. However a good very short flight to Mykonos and Aegean cannot be blamed for the ground crew. I would happily fly with them again.
40,Economy flight return from Dublin to New York. No complaints about either flight. Both departed on time. Arrival in New York as a 'domestic' passenger is a real bonus. Flight out was on an Airbus with a 2-4-2 configuration which was nice. Return flight was on a 757 with an Air Contractors Shannon based crew (according to the announcement). Seating was not as good but as it was less than 6hrs back not an issue. Entertainment channels were fine. Food served was perfectly acceptable.
41,Flights FRA-DUB return. Overall a good experience with Aer Lingus. Flights were on time seat comfort ok and staff very good. Food and drinks only for purchase but prices are fair and quality is good. Had a pre-ordered Irish breakfast on my flight to Dublin which was very good. Only minus was the cleanliness at my seat on the return flight to Frankfurt my table was full of chocolate and the window was dirty too.
42,Overall surprisingly a great experience - emphasis on the surprise. Flying Boston to Edinburgh with a layover in Dublin. Checked in online was almost immediately sent an email and text informing me my flight was delayed 40 minutes. Arrive at the airport and am continuously informed of further delays. The plane was late getting in and they flipped it as quickly as they could somehow managing to get fresh blankets and pillows in every seat although they did not have time to get fresh headsets on board before takeoff. By the time we got off the ground we were 2 hours behind schedule. Despite this we were informed that we would only be half an hour behind schedule due to favorable weather. This was not the case we were over an hour late. Upon arrival in Dublin almost everyone on the plane were given tickets for new flights since literally all of us missed our connections due to the delays. I was booked on the next flight out of Dublin (which was still a 5 hour wait) and given vouchers in 5 euro increments for breakfast as compensation for the inconvenience. Everyone with whom I spoke during the delay the confusion and the ticket transferring was absolutely a joy seriously one of the best customer service experiences I have had while flying. The food on the flight was great for airline food and in the course of a 5 hour flight we were given a beverage and snack service dinner coffee/tea and morning juice. For the price you really just can't beat it.
43,BUD-ATH-JTR and back with a stopover. Nice surprise! Clean new aircraft (A320/A321) and the BUD-ATH sector even had a hot meal you don't see that so much today. Had to pay for my luggage in JTR agent was very polite so no problem. Will definitely not hesitate to fly them again.
44,Flew MXP-ATH-KGS and back with Aegean in mid-May. After being used to the service quality of US flights I was pretty impressed with their service. Light meals were served on each leg of the flight the crew were friendly and though only the route map was provided as entertainment it was all I needed so I was satisfied with that as well. Would recommend this airline for people traveling to/from/within Greece.
45,DUB-JFK - December 2014. Third time flying Business with EI most flights are economy and this was a treat for our wedding anniversary. From Dublin - check in efficient lounge pleasant US immigration took minutes. Boarded first and welcomed with a glass of champagne. Crew chatty and attentive. Lovely meal and a few hours sleep on the near flat beds. I understand this year they will move to fully flat. Arrive in JFK as a domestic passenger so seamless to public transport or a cab. Flying back was excellent too. Slept most of the flight. Crew in good spirits but not as good as the crew out on the 17th (4pm flight). Overall top marks.
46,SNN-BOS: I booked the flight on the Aer Lingus website and the cost was very reasonable. Check in was quick and efficient in less than 5 minutes same with security and US Immigration which is a real bonus. The flight was operated by Air Contractors for Aer Lingus 757 which is a smaller aircraft to the traditional A330 Aer lingus used to use on the route. I chose to sit in the back cabin of the aircraft as most people were sitting up at the front and the middle of the aircraft the few of us at the back had a row of three seats each. The seat pitch was fine (and mush better compared to the Qantas A380 which I was on two weeks prior). The pre order meal is well worth the extra money especially for the west bound flight it includes wine and has proper cutlery and is served on porcelain and the meal is served individually before the standard meals. In-flight entertainment was touch screen (there was no remote and the head sets is plugged into the side of the screen) with a good choice of movies: there are some new releases and a good few classic movies with the usual array of sitcoms music and the in-flight map. Crew were friendly and professional throughout the flight chatting with the passengers throughout the service. There was a small snack of a large flapjack with tea or coffee before landing. Overall a good service comfortable aircraft (despite the smaller size of the 757 there was a nice area near the aft restrooms to stretch your legs) good seat pitch (I am 6 ft) and it is well worth upgrading your meal.
47,Munich-Athens-Munich. Both flights on time very clean and comfortable Airbus A320/321 planes. Beautiful well- groomed and very nice young cabin crew only hot meals served on both flights full bar service incl very nice Greek wines. Bags delivered within 20 mins. Highly recommended.
48,LHR-ATH leg on Aegean Airlines Flight A3601 Economy. Check in with Aegean was a breeze professional and quick. Boarding was efficient and welcomed on board by polite and attentive crew with genuine smiles. Nice to see New Airbus A321 clean outside and spotless interior. Lunch consisted of tasty Greek meatballs with potatoes which was delicious. Greek salad as starter and a nice dessert. Tea and a choice of coffees were available and the usual soft drinks. Cabin crew were very polite and pleasant helpful and offered service with a smile. A Singapore Airlines style service. Return leg ATH-LHR was just as pleasant. Found the whole Aegean experience to be very comfortable with polite attentive crew and good service throughout. Would have no hesitation in using them again.
49,Flew DUB-SFO. Staff very attentive and polite. Booked Skydine well worth doing plentiful and tasty. Seats a little cramped. Blankets were not fresh! Return trip bathrooms a little tardy breakfast orange juice and snack dispensed with rather quickly by over enthusiastic young staff but will definitely use them again. Overall staff pleasant will use again.
50,EI 634 1 Jan DUB-BRU. I flew with Aer Lingus for the first time on New Year's Day and found cabin is clean with very basic in-flight facilities as no drop-down video screen buy on board food and no newspapers but departed and landed on time.
51,City break to (CDG) Paris just before Christmas. Friendly crew who handled the flight in an efficient no nonsense manner. Both legs departed and arrived in time. Approx 75% full with a mix of business leisure and Disney visitors. Buy on board food is reasonably priced and the pre-order Irish breakfast was delicious. Fare was just ??00 return. Recommended.
52,"Round-trip New York-Moscow in Premium Economy was excellent. No problems with /check-in, both flights were on time, cabins were clean and seats were comfortable. The crew were pleasant and helpful, food was decent but the movies available on the AVOD were rather limited. The fare I paid was very reasonable and I think the Premium Economy service is an excellent value. All in all, I was extremely satisfied with Aeroflot and definitely would fly with them again."
53,ATH-FCO 2 hours flight on time. Check-in Lounge Cabin crews all friendly and smooth operation. Complementary hot meal with pasta and soft drinks small bottle Greek wine coffee/tea. Priority luggage came out first at the FCO airport.
54,"EI 774/775 Dublin-Agadir-Dublin. Travelled 20 December - aircraft named the St Albert found the crew in both directions excellent. However the aircraft was old grubby and very tired looking it seems to be used on ""leisure"" destinations (a bit like the old charter style operations) the seat pitch is definitely narrower than their other aircraft and there was no seat pockets I'm accustomed to not having them on Ryanair and don't mind but on a 4 hour flight it's awkward. Ordered pre-order meals - they were ok I'm still not a fan of Clodagh McKennas inflight menu but it filled the gap. Unless you are in the 1st 3 rows they don't generally have much left when they come around. As I had booked wheelchair assistance for my mother I wasn't surprised that on arrival Swissport who do the handling do not have any lifts to take the passengers off the flight this is a regular occurrence at Agadir out of Aer LIngus's remit I reckon. Overall Aer Lingus is continually good."
55,I often travel with Aer Lingus from Belfast City to Gatwick and have also flown to Portugal with them as well. The flights are always on time staff polite and very helpful. I'm not a fan of flying long or short journeys but I enjoy the experience with Aer Lingus.
56,"JFK-DUB - First time flying Aer Lingus transatlantic and being Irish was looking forward to the service having previously flown Delta BA and Air France. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. It may be a good service to those who haven't flown other airlines long haul. I found the seats cramped and uncomfortable. The PTV touchscreen was very unresponsive. They went around and gave one measly plastic cup of soft drink and advised those who wanted to ""buy"" wine for dinner they better do so now. Dinner arrived around an hour later (way too late as on a night flight everyone wants to get some sleep). By the time dinner came everyone had obviously finished their drinks and couldn't get another one with their dinner. The cabin crew didn't look too happy. When dinner was handed out and rubbish collected they disappeared for the rest of the flight. No water nothing. In comparison I flew Delta out and they were miles better complimentary wine with dinner (and a second and third if you wanted it). They came around with free drinks very soon after take off and dinner promptly after that. They served drinks with dinner and were very attentive throughout the rest of the flight handing out refreshments. They were also very friendly. I will not fly Aer Lingus transatlantic anymore when there are much better options. Management really need to look at what the competition are offering charging for things and being scabby on long flights is not really on in this day and age."
57,"I was traveling alone with my six-month old baby. The first leg from London to Moscow went smoothly. The aircraft was very comfortable and there was an option of a bassinet. I am especially thankful to a flight attendant who was extra helpful and attentive to me as she saw that I was alone with a small child. The second leg from Moscow to Bishkek was much more difficult. It was a red eye 4-hour flight. I had zero help from the crew even when locating the seat and trying to manage my cranky and tired baby, and at the same time putting the carry on bag on top. The bassinet option was only available in business class. The temperature on the plane was extremely high. It was unbearably hot for the whole duration of the flight. The crew did not offer any help whatsoever. Traveling alone with a small child is a mission in itself. But there was no sympathetic attention from that crew at all."
58,The flight was OK and comfortable. The price was the best on the market and the service was amazing. The planes were clean and new and all of my flights were without any troubles. I would like to say thanks to Aeroflot and its staff.
59,"FCO-SVO-NRT return trip. In Rome we found out that our flight to Tokyo was cancelled - crew on the airport wasn't very helpful, but the call centre proved to be the best solution to sort us out and we had our tickets rebooked for direct flight with Alitalia to Tokyo Narita. So the 1st leg we didn't fly with Aeroflot (if not for the call centre we would be probably stranded in Rome). The return flight on A330-300 was better than we expected - 3 or 4 yrs old aircraft with a decent amount of leg space (in comparison with Alitalia it was better), pretty good IFE and really nice food - sushi and seafood pasta which I can say was probably the best onboard meals I've ever had. SVO-FCO in A320 was also nice, good Recaro blue seats and again pretty good meals. Service wasn't smiling a lot, but was attentive and my and my group really enjoyed the flights. All in all Aeroflot exceeded expectations! would definitely recommend it (except for the airport staff in Rome which wasn't helpful at all with rebooking the ticket!)."
60,I flew from Geneva to Athens in May 2014. Crew were very polite and welcoming the service was excellent for the price. I was surprised to have a full meal and to receive an alcoholic drink for free for such a low ticket price. I flew back with a low cost airline from Thessaloniki?¦the ticket was more expensive and of course nothing was offered to eat or drink. I was also surprised to see how fast and easy it is to upgrade in their miles and bonus program. I have already booked my next flight with them.
61,Athens - Brussels - Athens. Nice service friendly staff clean and comfortable seats. Good food on time.
62,LHR-ATH-RHO return. First time with Aegean. Extremely pleasant and professional staff excellent planes and comfortable seating. Not cheap but excellent airline.
63,Glasgow to Dublin on Friday returned Sunday. Booked and paid for seats at the front of the plane only to find that the only exit is at the back. Not a major issue but annoying plus a complete waste of money on what was already an expensive flight. Delay on way back as gate was late opening all kept waiting at gate in absolutely freezing conditions. Cabin staff on way out were very friendly and gave lots of great advice on shopping in Dublin.
64,LHR-DUB-LGW was pretty good both ways with the outbound being delayed and inbound arriving early. Flight staff were always very nice and welcoming. Since this was a short flight the low-cost carrier side of the airline revealed itself quite a bit. Didn't experience any problems and would definitely fly with them again.
65,"Amsterdam-Moscow delayed due to special needs passengers leaving the plane in Amsterdam. Seats on the Airbus 321-200 are still real business class seats (not the common KLM-BA-Lufthansa nonsense 3-economy seats/ 2-persons space). Service is good, lunch is good (even special vegetarian meal), entertainment system is available and with a large choice. And the Russian hospitality is smiling and attentive to the guests. Had a good time on the first part of my trip. Changed planes in Moscow. Priority lane works well if the connecting flight is with Aeroflot. Moscow-Ulan Bator left on time. Seats on the Boeing 737-800 are only to be used for short distances, less than 4 hours. Mine was a medium haul flight of 6 hours. A night flight with chairs not to be used for sleeping. No real business class flat bed seat on these planes. A great pity. The service is good, dinner/breakfast is good (even the special meal for a vegetarian), entertainment system is available and with a large choice . And the Russian hospitality was once more smiling and attentive to the guests. The seats on the second flight let them down. The rest was a good experience."
66,"The service was great. There was enough food and it was tasty (2 full meals and snacks and drinks whenever you want). Takeoff and landing were great. Cabin crew was pleasant in general. There were some bad aspects of the flight, such as very slow entertainment system, big delay for more than 3 hours. In general the flight was good except the delay in Vladivostok airport."
67,A321 and A320 Kos - Athens / Athens - Vienna May 3 2014. Nice service friendly staff clean and comfortable seats. Simple and useful online check-in.
68,Dublin to Paris CDG return. I paid for a flexible ticket which costs more than twice the ordinary fare. By right this should be equivalent to business class fare. However Aer Lingus operates an economy only seating on this route. It used to include 2 checked bangs of 20 kgs each. Not anymore as you only get one 20kg bag now. With this fare you get lounge access but you still have to purchase food and drinks on the plane. Outbound flight was largely ok. On the return trip I was very annoyed to discover that the overhead bin was full and as I was on seat 1C there was no front seat I could put my small carry on luggage under. Eventually the stewardess managed to squeeze it in an overhead bin above the seat behind. I find this unacceptable as obviously no proper checks were carried out allowing people to carry disproportionately more stuff on board and thus depriving others from getting their fare share of space. It irritated me even more that I had paid over the odds to discover that there was no space for my small carry on luggage above my seat. I have to agree with strict policies regarding carry on luggage as is with Ryanair. I guess I will still continue flying Aer Lingus as there are not too many options on this route but Aer Lingus should probably have a small business class cabin so that those who pay more get that bit more for the extra they fork out for their ticket. Alas I am unlikely to see this in my lifetime. In summary I think the worst thing an airline can do is combining a low cost approach while still charging extra for which you don't get much more. If Aer Lingus wants to be a real low cost airline that's fine but don't charge more and give nothing much in return.
69,I recently flew Aer Lingus from Malaga to Dublin and then on to San Francisco again with Aer Lingus from Dublin the following day. I have never flown with Aer Lingus before but cannot fault either the flights or their customer service. We booked the enhanced meals on our return flights from Dublin to San Francisco and my only comment would be that although the outgoing meals were superb the incoming meals appeared to have been a little overcooked. Without exception all flights left on time and arrived early.
70,Flew EI111. Service I will admit was bad. I fly maybe 4 times a year with Aer Lingus on its European network and some people need to remember that we sadly have left the era of luxury air travel like the Great Swissair. Even flag carriers now have to cut costs. What you pay for on Aer Lingus is very cheap for the service compared to another low cost Irish airline.
71,"Really an excellent new premium economy product. Almost as wide a seat as business class without the full recline. I have an allergy problem and they ran out of the meal option in premium economy that I could eat, so the attendants gave me a meal from business class. The service in premium economy was really what I would have expected in business class, constantly serving drinks and providing service. Amazing value for the money. Brand new in-flight entertainment system on the B777-300ER, same day / night destination time zone synchronization lighting (i.e. blue during the day time at destination) as is found on the new Boeing 787. Bath rooms had extra amenities, wet wipes, deodorants, and hand towels. Beyond my expectations for Premium Economy (which they reffer to as comfort class)."
72,"Our nonstop flight from LED to SXF was cancelled some weeks before travel and we were re-booked on a flight via SVO which meant approximately twice the original flight time, but we had no problem getting to know a new airport. The flight from LED to SVO had a delay and although we were told that the connecting flight would wait for us as (because of the re-booking) there would be a large group of SXF passengers on board, it did not. But directly upon entering SVO airport a SU representative would hand out pre-printed new boarding passes and a beverage voucher, so no need to go to a transfer desk. I found that quite professional. The aircraft used were in very good shape and we found seats and legroom far superior to most western airlines. Crews were dressed in very attractive uniforms and were quite fluent in English. Alcoholic drinks and a sandwich (even a pre-ordered vegetarian one for my companion) were offered - basic, but hey, that's the way it is nowadays. Small downpoint: the very interestingly looking in-flight magazine was almost exclusively in Russian language. The transfer in SVO (as well as entering Russia in LED) was quick and smooth (performed by traditionally grumpy staff, though). The sparkling airports in LED and SVO but Berlin's SXF trashy airport to shame. We were quite impressed by SU and would not hesitate to use them again, especially when they offer a decent rate to Asia in their new Premium Economy."
73,"Excellent service, much better than expected. The Delhi-Moscow journey was good except for the IFE, the Moscow-New York leg was excellent. The meal served was excellent and the seats were pretty comfortable. The Moscow airport connection was a bit confusing."
74,First flight with Aegean Airlines and found it all very relaxing. The staff were friendly and helpful and tried to give the personal touch. From the moment we checked our bags in we found them to be really helpful. I was very nervous about the stay over and catching the next flight from ATH to RHO but they really reassured me and made sure I felt happy. On arrival in ATH they made the change of flight very stress free. Definitely use them again. So much different to Ryanair who were dreadful.
75,I was booked on an evening flight from Santorini to Athens but arrived very late and after closure of the check-in desk. I expected the worst that is to be refused boarding but I was so impressed that the Aegean staff agreed to check me in opened the check-in desk and helped me to join the other boarding passengers very efficiently. Full marks for flexibility without compromising security or delaying the flight and that extra effort made such a difference and saved me from a nightmarish situation of cancelled onward flights and hotel. The flight itself was also very stress-free and the hostesses were polite and friendly. Very nice airline.
76,"LHR to DUB. Flew out of T2. As a Gold Circle member I used the lounge. The views and ambience is far superior to the old T1 lounge but the food is still pretty pathetic the exception being the coffee - there is a machine as well as a percolator. The flight was fine with one exception the seat pitch was incredibly tight. This is a refurbished plane with the magazine rack at eye level. I am only 5ft 4"" but I still found the space very tight."
77,October 16. Business Class Orlando to Dublin and economy class connecting to Amsterdam. It is difficult to fault this airline. The quality and attitude of the flight attendants is remarkable. This was true even on the connecting economy flight to Amsterdam despite the seating being very tight and the flight was packed. Flights departed and left on time. Boarding was more chaotic as patrons waited while families with infants and those in wheelchairs boarded early but brought with them large extended families as well to take advantage of the early boarding. October 25 the return flight from Amsterdam only allows check in with KLM but Aer Lingus passengers find out too late that they cannot print boarding passes from the hotel but only at blue KLM machines in the airport. On return to Orlando in the time it took to walk for the gate to baggage Aer Lingus already had the bags on the conveyor belt. Now that's a first.
78,"This was my first experience with Aeroflot and I was pleasantly surprised with the airline. In DC our trip got off to a rough start as Aeroflot's flight was not listed on any departure boards, nor was the gate marked with flight information. I don't know if this is a problem to do with the airline or airport. Once on board we were greeted by a clean and new looking airbus. The economy seats were cramped on our trans-atlantic stretch but not more so than other US and European carriers I've flown. The service was fairly good. The cabin crew were all business and no smiles, but they came around often to see if passengers needed anything. We had two hot meals that were edible and the in seat entertainment system had a really good selection of films. My only complaint on the trans-atlantic flight was that breakfast was served three hours before landing at 4.30 am Moscow time, unnecessarily cutting into sleep time. Our short-haul leg was equally comfortable. Again the planes looked new and were very clean. Cabin staff came through with snacks and beverages. Overall I found Aeroflot a pleasant experience. I think the airlines greatest weakness is its Moscow hub. The trans-atlantic schedules require long layovers. While I had a problem free flight, I saw a number of other passengers struggle to sort out problems with ground staff at the SVO transfer desk."
79,"Good value for money, although aircraft itself is old, seats are worn out. Polite and helpfull staff on board. Ok meals."
80,Flew Hong Kong to Moscow then Moscow to London. It was okay I had read a lot of bad reviews beforehand and whilst I felt the flight attendants were perhaps not too enthusiastic the entertainment food and legroom was not bad at all. Everything went smoothly. The flight was quite low on passengers too which always makes it more comfortable.
81,"ATH-MUC in economy in March 2014 economy has the dreaded ""slimline"" seats that LH started and everyone seems to be following. That said flight crew was pleasant and professional airplane was clean flight landed on time- Aegean even gives you a snack and a drink on this flights. Pleasant experience would recommend."
82,LCA-ATH-BRU: Very average experience. Flying from Larnaca to Athens flight arrived on time to the destination seat space was ok food was horrible. Inflight service very average. Nobody expects anything special flying economy regarding food but what Aegean served for breakfast was beyond words. A tasteless omelette there was liquid coming out of it plus a small chocolate. The second segment of my flight from Athens to Brussels was better in leg space service and food but I find unacceptable the control they have on hand luggage. Lately they introduced the low fare tickets for people travelling with just hand luggage people of course try to benefit from this. Passengers carry in the cabin what they would otherwise have checked at the check in counters! What is happening is that people carry oversized suitcases and try to fit them in the overhead storage holders and I was really surprised to see that they allow this. I was carrying a 6 kg soft handbag which I placed in the overhead holder above my seat and the air hostess asked me if she could move it in a holder further in the other row simply to fit a big suitcase! The most positive aspect to this airline is the convenient times.
83,3/10/14 London Heathrow to Dublin Flight EI155. I am fed up with the Aer Lingus bashing on this site. Whilst conceding that I am Irish and could be accused of bias on the number of occasions over the last few years I have flown with Aer Lingus I can truthfully say that the overall service has been outstanding. Flight delays are usually outside the control of the airline. The crews without exception have been warm friendly and totally professional. I have enjoyed flying with Aer Lingus and look forward to doing so again.
84,"Flew CWL-DUB-JFK and YYZ-DUB-CWL business class. Had the opportunity to bid for upgrade which we did and was accepted. The flight from CWL was on Stobart Air new plane and surprisingly quite a bit of leg room and seat comfort. We chose this route so we could clear immigration in DUB which was very easy to do and then sit in the BC lounge until ready to fly. The trip over was great comfortable seats which laid flat wi-fi 5 course meal on real plates and a tasty snack before we landed. The cabin crew were delightful nothing was too much trouble. The IFE was ok I mainly listened to music which had some great artists on there and some relatively new releases. I did not watch a film as I was too busy playing email tag with friends taking advantage of the wi-fi. Arrived at JFK on time and breezed through the terminal to collect luggage and to meet our waiting transfer. Return journey YYZ-DUB-CWL. Business lounge in YYZ airport is run by KLM massive lounge with great selection of food and drinks. The return plane was a different configuration and older so BC was not as comfortable in my opinion. There were only 12 seats and 2 were empty we were in row 1 and the screen for the IFE was so far away I could barely see it. One member of staff to care for our needs she was rather offhand and sourfaced not like that smilers we had coming over. Dinner was served it was ok but not to the standard of the outward flight and the seats were not as comfortable due to the fact that when you did use the recline/lie flat you were placed at an angle that made you feel as if you were about to slide on the floor. During the flight I asked for a cup of coffee (I dont sleep) and she said I will be serving breakfast in 30 minutes would you like yours now I said no just the coffee. When she served breakfast she did not give me mine so had to ask when she replied ""oh you said you did not want breakfast"". When we arrived at DUB we had to go through security again despite having just gotten off a plane and only being in transit. Due to the plane being slightly late we only had 15mins to get to our gate. Our bags were scrutinised and my friends duty free was checked to see if the seal had been broken and the receipt matched with the label. Very irritating we did end up being slightly late to our gate (we had our boarding passes) but it was stress we could have done without. The flight back to CWL was with Stobart Air packed but no problems. All in all not bad for the price we paid as the outward journey balanced the return."
85,BUD-SVO-NRT and back Economy class. Short haul was an A320 long one A330. All flights on time. Somewhat more legroom and comfortable seats on the A320 but they were still ok on the A330. Onboard lunch/dinner surprisingly good breakfasts/snacks kind of mixed basket. IFE on A330 had a wide enough selection of movies no music for my taste and really sluggish controls. Flight attendants helpful and nice except of the first flight BUD-SVO. I lost my itinerary Aeroflot employees at Narita helped me out. SVO terminal F really sucks but that's not the airline's fault. My first experience with Aeroflot was positive I'd rate them close to 4 stars overall and I will fly them again.
86,17/4 TLV-SVO-CAN 25/5 return. TLV-SVO B-777 excellent leg room SVO-CAN CAN-SVO SVO-TLV A-330. All planes clean with no trouble. All flights almost on time good website to book good service from staff. Meals could be better this time choice of meals has improved compared to 6 months ago.
87,Aegean is really unpredictable. Can be excellent in every way or disappointing in many other ways. For example though their fares are in no way low cost they started charging 20 euros for a piece of luggage each way (short haul) and 30 euros for longer flights i.e. to Spain. BA and CY do not charge. Going out to BCN cost me for 2 pax 95 euros more than for our return flight on Vueling. Of course Vueling offers no breakfast (you have to pay for it) yet breakfast on Aegean was as poor as you can imagine. Yes on this flight they used the good jet steps and not their favourite bus transport to - from aircraft. One thing that is really impressive is the inflight attendants exceptionally professional.
88,Took 2 flights with Aegean Airlines in December 2013 and was truly impressed. Their quality of service was a long way ahead of British Airways that I used on 4 other flights and I will look at using Aegean Airlines again on my next trip to Europe - if Athens is on the trip list!
89,BRU to Athens on 11 Jan 2014 and flight A3622 from Athens to BRU on 15 Jan 2014. First time experience with Aegean Airlines was very pleasurable from good online check-in mobile boarding card on time departures friendly patient cabin crew and service oriented ground staff.
90,"My flight to Buenos Aires was not full, plenty of room to stretch. Flight to Miami was full because of school vacation, big mistake on my part. The A330 is uncomfortable in economy. When the seat in front of you is reclined, you have the tray table pitted against you stomach, even if you are not fat. The flight attendants should ask everyone to sit upright when serving meals on the A330. Rows are so close that it is impossible to get up from your seat normally. One must slide to the end and climb out. I have flown this aircraft before and they are all the same in Economy - horrible. Considering how packed the flight was, the flight attendants were excellent. The food was mediocre with two choices: pasta or beef, and very small servings. Flight attendants provided drinks generously and water service was available throughout the flight. Bathrooms were kept fairly clean. Movie selection was very good, free headphones were provided. A very uncomfortable aircraft, avoid the A330 Economy. Only seats that looked spacious were the exit row seats. Check-in at EZE was smooth despite crowds and airport chaos."
91,I flew from Chicago O'Hare to Dublin and from Dublin to Amsterdam and Amsterdam back to Dublin and Dublin back to O'Hare and I must say I was pleased with the airline. The food was good the entertainment was good and the leg room on the flights was great. Only issue I did have was from Amsterdam to Dublin because we arrived 30 minutes left and nearly missed our connecting flight from Dublin to O'Hare however we made it on time with all of our belongings. Will definitely use Aer Lingus again on any future trips to Ireland.
92,Kerry-Dublin-Kerry on 14th October. Flight is Aer Lingus Regional operated by Stobart Air. Flights departed and arrived on time and were relatively smooth. Transit through Kerry and Dublin airports (with no luggage) was easy. The aircraft was uncomfortably hot during the early morning flight from Kerry. Food was dreadful - a rock hard scone from 'Clodagh's Kitchen'. Not Clodagh's best bake! These are relatively minor though easily resolved quibbles in what is a very useful service.
93,Used the BHX-DUB flight taking about an hour and just wanted to say what a pleasant experience it was compared to the competition on this route. No check-in queue or problems even though I was late due to a delayed train. A relaxed and pleasant experience throughout. No being herded onto stairwells so that the airline can stick to its tight schedules - just walked straight onto the plane after a short wait. The plane itself was a newish ATR 72-600 with an easy-on-the-eye light grey/blue interior - not the oppressive yellow and blue of the competition. Also no jarring announcements or being pestered to buy scratch cards. National carriers are also often a small window on the country to which you are travelling so it was nice to have staff that were actually Irish. Terminal 2 in Dublin is also much easier than T1. A relaxing experience and good all round - well worth the extra few euros (although actually cheaper than FR for this particular trip).
94,We recently flew Aer Lingus from Chicago to Dublin and we can now say that we have a new favorite airline. Flights were on time luggage problems were non-existent and the staff was great.
95,Tel Aviv - Moscow Sheremetjevo - Bangkok and return. Twice B777 and Airbus 330. Airbus 330 on the Moscow - Bangkok route. Not very comfortable these airplanes. Personal TV with mostly older movies. Food nothing special and no beer or wine served on any of the routes I have flown. I can understand they do not serve liquor but not even a beer with dinner. Service is average to good and friendly. Aeroflot got me on time where I was flying to. I think there are far better choices out there then Aeroflot.
96,ARN-SVO-BKK return on new A320 and B773. Flights more or less on time. No problem with transfer. Good in-flight entertainment on B773. Food in economy just OK. We got an upgrade to Comfort class on BKK-SVO which was great. Big seats and plenty of leg room. Food also better - but not sure if better because of Comfort class or because made in Thailand. I don't like Aeroflots bread buns wrapped in plastic. They ought to have fresh bread. I also think all passengers on all long haul flights ought to be given 05 litres of water in bottles. Only difference to other European 3 and 4 star carriers appears to be the no alcohol policy. If a bit better food - and maybe a bit better English for some staff Aeroflot could easily be a 4 star airline.
97,Athens-Dusseldorf. Pleasant flight catering could be better. The negative part was the ground staff (at the gate): they changed without asking us the flight by transferring us to the next flight.
98,Although I have been rooting for Aegean in the past these past months I have traveled RHO-ATH-RHO many times and each time the experience seems to be worsening. The boarding and flight schedules are perfectly fine if you ignore the constant use of a bus for boarding instead of jumping platforms in Athens but the cabin experience apart from the seat comfort which is ok is worse every time. The take off is usually ok. The trip to Rhodes lasts for approximately 50 minutes and the cabin crew are struggling to serve you. It looks as if with one hand they serve and with the other they collect what they have just served for landing. The crew are typically indifferent and tend not to smile. The catering is average but couldn't expect big things for a 50 minute flight. For now it progressively costs more money to travel with Aegean that what you actually get in return at least for these domestic routes.
99,AEP-MTV short 30 min flight. Check in at aeroparque was fast no lines for security line. Boarding by bus 20 min delay no explanation given. Once on board nice FA nice service and arrival nearly on time. Bags short on belt. Good option on this route.
100,Flight BHI-AEP-BHI August 2014 with Aerolineas Argentinas. A domestic flight both of only 1 hour. Crew were friendly and polite. Catering service was just OK. Aircraft were old but still comfortable (both B737). Both flights on time.
101,I flew from Chicago O'Hare to Dublin and from Dublin to Amsterdam and Amsterdam back to Dublin and Dublin back to O'Hare and I must say I was pleased with the airline. The food was good the entertainment was good and the leg room on the flights was great. Only issue I did have was from Amsterdam to Dublin because we arrived 30 minutes left and nearly missed our connecting flight from Dublin to O'Hare however we made it on time with all of our belongings. Will definitely use Aer Lingus again on any future trips to Ireland.
102,Flew from Belfast City Airport to Palma. The flight was delayed on the way out although it was confirmed that this was due to the airport the plane was leaving to come to Belfast to pick us up and in the end it was only just over an hour due to a speedy turn around by Aer Lingus staff. The aircraft was clean and tidy and not at all tired looking a good job especially given the short turnaround time that staff had. Flight was comfortable with a decent enough level of leg room although the cabin did feel a little hot on both out and inbound flights. The food selection was decent and of a standard a little higher than I would have normally expected although perhaps in the grander scheme of things like most airlines a little pedestrian. The return flight was much the same no problems and nothing to further stress my wife and I while travelling with our toddler for her first time on a plane. Also a few days after landing I contacted Aer Lingus as we seemed to have misplaced a new pair of shoes we had bought in Palma airport for our daughter. Usually some airlines are impossible to deal with after the fact however Aer Lingus were helpful and really gave the impression they went the extra mile to see if they could locate our misplaced shoes.
103,The flight from JFK to DUB was good the food was very nice however the entertainment is very lacking compared to other carriers - old choices and not a big selection. On the return trip the cabin was freezing and delayed by an hour food wasn't good on way back and entertainment was the same.
104,Flew LHR to SVO 27/3/15 returned 4/4/15. Outbound A321 return A330-300. Both trips were comfortable with cabin crew all very helpful and pleasant to a non Russian Speaker. We were in economy both ways. The plane was clean the toilets were fine and the food and drinks provided were good for airline food in our family experience. Overall a very pleasant experience No IFE on way out as small plane but lots on way back choice was good.
105,I flew Aeroflot with a connection in Moscow. On my 10 hour long flights we were served two meals! The food was very good considering it was airline food. It was hot with plenty of bread and salad. Free wine was served throughout the flight. We were provided with slippers blankets pillows and eye shields. The staff were very courteous and announcements were made in Russian and English. The entertainment had a terrific selection of movies and music. If you are a tall person you are better off purchasing the emergency exit seats as they were so much more comfortable for someone 6'. Connection in Moscow which I was a bit fearful of was actually a very nice experience. They accepted US dollars. Most sales people spoke some English. Free wifi in coffee shops. The cleanest airport I have ever been to with janitors cleaning the toilets constantly wiping down all chrome pillars in hallways. Sparkling clean. Connections were smooth where my check in luggage went straight to my destination without having to recheck. The smaller airbus for my 4 hour flight to Venice did not have any entertainment video but did serve a meal. I recommend Aeroflot as great airline for the price! Was totally surprised.
106,First time flying with Aegean Airlines from FRA to ATH on a Lufthansa codeshare and couldn't be happier. Nice to have inflight infotainment on a short haul flight and not bad food better than Air Canada. No delays on time and cabin crew were nice. Only downside was that there was no seat-back monitors which many airliners are upgrading to and seats are sort of stiff.
107,ATH-ROM-ATH. Great airline with great service and great staff. The trip was perfect despite the bad weather.
108,I have now been flying with Aegean since they took over the Olympic slots at Heathrow. This year on the morning of October 7th Heathrow was fog bound so the flight to Athens was delayed by two hours. This meant missing the evening flight to Mykonos. As soon as I was checking in their staff were most helpful. On arriving at Athens I was put up in Hotel Sofitel everything paid for and caught the flight to Mykonos the following morning. My only thought is that the evening flight to Mykonos is too tight with the London flight around about an hour and needs looking in to. Aegean is an excellent airline as part of my holiday flew with them to Crete as well all flights were full and I look forward to flying with them next October.
109,"AR 1303 April 23rd and AR 1302 April 26th. We were looking for a reasonable Business Class fare from Miami to Buenos Aires we were amazed at how much less expensive Aerolineas was than the other carriers that we checked and were worried that it might be due to an inferior flight experience but decided that since were only flying down for three days to attend a wedding he had to go for it. Well I'm happy to report that with Aerolineas Argentinas you don't ""get what you pay for"" you get much more. The plane we took was an elderly Airbus that was a bit tattered (especially the bathrooms) but the seats were lie-flat and comfortable the food was above average (much better than American) and the flight attendants were cheerful professional and happy to help with a smile unlike the surly overweight lazy tenured FAs on most U.S. legacy carriers. I would fly Aerolineas again."
110,We flew business class (club condor) from JFK on Feb 21 and returned on Feb 28. Great experience. Airbus 330-200 was clean and comfortable. Both flights left on time. Crews were first-rate. Great bargain. Highly recommend it.
111,Two flights the first EI 564 DUB-BCN and the other EI 739 PMI-DUB. The first took off late due to the late arrival of the aircraft which was the truth (refreshingly) as the aircraft only arrived 20mins before we were due to depart but the time was made up with a fairly quick two hour flight to BCN. Not a full flight so we had space to move and didn't have the usual cabin baggage issues. Took the cabin crew a while to get going with inflight service but they had everything we asked for. The crew were nice if a little robotic. Plane wasn't spotless but they were in a hurry to go again so understandable (it wasn't filthy either). The flight back was packed and the airport in Palma is awful one of the warmest airports I've set foot in. The usual issues with pax and their cabin baggage while this is not the fault of the crew it should be dealt with or pax should know how to stow their luggage efficiently. It seems to rather aggravate the cabin crew that they are reduced to baggage handlers and rightly too. Otherwise there were similar crew-bots to the ones on the way over. Did everything by the book and kept the lights low for anyone who wanted to sleep. As per usual the bags took an age to arrive and this seems to be quite a regular occurrence now. But as an experience but flights were absolutely fine and pretty good value for money.
112,SVO-PEK and back. I have travelled with Aeroflot several times within the past year I have to say that the level of service you get with this airline is inconsistent. Compared to my last trip with them (STR-SVO-LED and back) which was extremely satisfying this time the service is only so-so. For SVO-PEK the cabin crew seemed inexperienced. The crew disappeared immediately after dinner service. The food from SVO is very average and the cleanliness of the toilet was not maintained well during the flight. For the return trip the crew members seemed much more experienced and they delivered a fairly high level of service. The food was also significantly better. Overall I think Aeroflot is improving. However they still have a long way to go. As a passenger your experience with them can vary greatly depending on the crew or the route. But considering the price which was very competitive I must say that what I got for this trip was fair.
113,Manchester-Athens Oct 2013. Boarding and landing was 20 minutes delayed. Very comfortable seats and excellent staff. Food was really good and you could choose from a variety of drinks. Overall a very good flying experience. The only thing i would like to stress is the lack of any entertainment. I don't know if it is so expensive to show a movie during the flight especially when the screens are available! An airline like Aegean should at least have some kind of entertainment for long flights.
114,My wife and I flew from Rome to Athens and Athens to Paris recently check in was a breeze and both flights were great. No problems at all.
115,We flew 3 times with this airline and all flights were great even though there were delays (up to 20 minutes ) all arrivals were on time . The first flight from Kiev to Athens the plane was a brand new Airbus A320 leather seats in the cabin and very comfortable. Take-off and landing were perfect the staff were normal. For food I do not intend to complain on a flight less than 3 hours. In general we were impressed with this airline and we can recommend it.
116,December 22nd 2014. MSP-JFK-EZE-FTE. Flew Club Condor. Others in our party of 5 flew coach. We had the full Monty flying Aerolineas. But the staff handled us well. Flight out left on time but no accommodations for Sky Priority passengers. Charge the gate at JFK was more like it. The food was very good. Service is prompt in that every flight attendant worked to get the job done so they could disappear. We liked how they gave us 3 options for our meals. The ice cream for desert and/or cheese plate were fantastic. And it is true they don't offer mixed drinks. For water they gave us a bottle for the over night flight. Breakfast was again very prompt well presented and the crew when prompted did go the extra step. On the return our child's vegetarian meal was missing. The crew promptly reviewed the menu and told us additional items we could choose from. For the return our flight was changed to add a stop at BRC. At which time we were notified our return to JFK was delayed from 11 pm to 6 am. Sky Priority line did nothing to help us here. We had to suffer with the rest. However they did rebook our last segment with Delta for us and effectively communicated to the crew in JFK to assist us and they did! They offered us a hotel and dinner in EZE. As we missed our JFK connection back to MSP they put us up in NYC and paid for dinner there as well. We turned down the offer for the hotel room in EZE and were able to sleep in the Club Condor Lounge. This is easily better than most First Class Lounges I have seen. Aerolineas in my opinion did much more than Delta United or American would have done for us. Our kids got to spend time touring NYC for the night. Our only downside was the plane could have been cleaner. Sad for a new A330-200. Here the domestic carriers do a better job. For the price we paid on for the ticket and what we got it was well worth it. When this airline makes mistakes they make up for it.
117,Flew four times over the course of a month internally around Argentina (EZE-El Calafate El Calafate-Trelew Trelew-EZE EZE-Iguazu) and was very happy with service. Check in was prompt and staff were friendly and bilingual. Never experienced any delays in fact we were actually moved forward from a 6 hour change at EZE to a flight departing 5 hours sooner for no extra charge. Snacks and drinks served in all flights and despite the 737-7 seats being noticeably more cramped and less comfortable than the -800 I'd certainly recommend.
118,Flight was from Toronto to Dublin. Seats were small and cramped. Drinks took forever to be served and were chargeable (on a transatlantic flight). Crew were very pleasant but there weren't enough of them and service was slow and poor. Food quality was poor - army standards. I am sure there are better airlines doing a better job - WestJet or Air Canada.
119,Flight #134 from Boston to Shannon on 9/1 and Flight #135 from Shannon to Boston on 9/9. We took Aer Lingus 757 contracted by Air Contractors. The price was right but you get what you pay for. The food was worse than TV dinners the stewardesses were so unfriendly (on both flights) and the TV's did not work on the flight back so we could not watch movies. My friend took the Aer Lingus airbus and said the food was fabulous and they had a wonderful experience. We could not say the same. Next time we would take the airbus.
120,Flew with Aeroflot CPH-SVO-NRT. Excellent service. I am a tall guy and Economy Class is usually a nightmare especially on long-haul flights. On my trip to Tokyo the flight attendants noticed that I was struggling to get room for my knees and offered me one of their personal seats which had more legroom and since these seats did not have any entertainment system the crew made sure I was comfortable for giving me extra drinks. (I got a full bottle of wine for free!!) Aeroflot has become an excellent airline and I will be happy to travel with them again.
121,Flew CPH-SVO-BKK and back in economy class in brand new Boeing 777-300er. Seating a bit cramped due to the 3-4-3 configuration. I guess the only complaint is the food which was horrible. Cabin crew helpful and efficient. No alcohol policy on airline due to incidents with drunk passengers. But overall Aeroflot did a good job getting us from a to b via SVO. We would book again with Aeroflot. But a food upgrade would be nice.
122,MAD-SVO-HKG return in Economy. Perfect trip Aeroflot is trying its best to be equally competitive with its European rivals and quite manages it. The only drawback is a horrible SVO connection. Unnecessary crowded passport controls for transit passengers Horrible terminal F. Otherwise would definitely fly with them again.
123,LHR-ATH-RHO and return October 2013. Checked in online for all flights and seat assignments honoured. Flights arrived on time or early. Boarding a little chaotic despite very strict adherence to boarding by rows. No queue jumping was allowed if your row hadn't been called you were not allowed to board. Yet somehow chaos and confusion reigned in the cabin partly because of the amount of hand luggage some passengers had been allowed to take on board and partly because every single flight was packed solid. In flight service was excellent if a little slow. Hot meals served on international flights (ok quality) free (and good) Greek wine available and refills willingly given. Fight attendants universally pleasant and service oriented. A321 on international flights with inflight entertainment on drop down screens. A320 on domestic service. Check in at LHR and RHO easy and quick. Baggage delivery prompt. All in all very pleasant.
124,I flew with a friend on the 3 December in Club Economy from Buenos Aires to Bariloche with a return booking for 9 December. The aircraft was a brand new Boeing 737-800 and the 2 by 2 sets in the forward Club Economy very comfortable and done in soft leather. A small snack was served by very friendly cabin staff and all was well until the beverage cart rolled by and we asked for some Malbec wine and were told that Aerolineas do not serve wine on domestic flights! One can imagine my surprise that after paying USD $992 per ticket that the flag carrier of Argentina which grows some of the world's finest wines does not showcase this product onboard-they did not even give us the option to purchase wine on a two hour flight! We will be returning to Buenos Aires on LAN.
125,For this short 100 min flight from Mendoza to Buenos Aires the economy seat on the 737-700 had plenty leg room and they even served a small lunch box which impressed me. Just beware that row 6 which was behind me has no window. I would not want to be in that seat!
126,Flew on Oct 21st from Ezeiza to Miami on AR 1304. Equipment was Airbus 330-200. Traveled in Business Class (Seat 5d) Check in service was very friendly and efficient. Business class lounge was spacious and comfortable and serviced by attentive staff. Boarding was very good and through a separate jet way from other cabin. Welcome on board was very friendly and helpful. Seats are flat but at an angle; very uncomfortable and I kept on sliding downwards. Inflight entertainment was good in terms of equipment but mediocre as far as programming both audio and video. Unfortunately the only WC in business class was out of order so we had to use filthy economy class lavatories. Not good.
127,We travelled from the Boston US to Ireland on an emergency trip. We flew on August 21 and returned today Sept. 5. Staff were excellent on both flights. We are traveling again in December and we look forward to much of the same. This was a short notice flight so it was a little pricey.
128,Bangkok to London Heathrow via Moscow. After reading mixed reviews thought this could be a nightmare when in actual fact the service was good. Friendly staff flights on time online check in and seat reservation a breeze at Bangkok you can check in at self service terminal - saves a lot of queuing. Very convenient print boarding card fast bag drop new planes and great prices the food served was not big portion sizes but was tasty standard economy airline food no alcohol served on the BKK to Moscow leg but plenty of soft drinks - water juices etc which came round every hr or so. Moscow airport: I read loads of negative reviews terminal F is old and not great but D & E where most international flights depart from are modern Burger king TGI Fridays etc loads of retail outlets prices same as all airports. I also read its a nightmare to transit between terminals when in fact its not it is a long walk between them but no problem. One security check one passport check. I have to say some staff look very stern but they are actually very friendly. There is no smoking in all terminals. All in all I would fly with them again based on price and service I received.
129,I flew from SGN to SVO on Dec 25 2014. Very good food good leg room. 1 bag late and delivered to hotel. Overall very good I will use them whenever possible.
130,Moscow-Warsaw 18 Dec. Pros: nice new clean Airbus aircraft with leather seats and decent legroom. Flight on time. Very smart looking attractive cabin crew. Good English so all announcements were understandable ( quite rare with Aeroflot). Cons: service downgraded rapidly since last month's flight I took with them. This time only small sandwich and water/coffee/tea offered - nothing else (last time was tray with meal cake and whole selection of soft drinks). EU restrictions I suppose. Cabin crew very official and robotic absolutely no personal touch no interaction - beautifully groomed but cold and serious. Inflight magazine thick and full of good articles but in Russian only (literally last 4 pages were in English only) which is pity as it looks very interesting.
131,ATH-HER-ATH connecting to Swiss ZRH-ATH-ZRH. Short 50 min flight on a A321. Flight completely full however the friendly crew managed to serve the whole plane drinks and peanuts. Very comfortable seats sufficient legroom. All in all very enjoyable. Would choose Aegean again.
132,ATH-PRG-ATH. All flights were smooth and on time. Check-in in Athens and Prague airport was fine and not too long. The seats on board the aircraft's were comfortable better than other airlines and the legroom was good. Inflight entertainment was nothing special. It was only the inflight map. The cabin crew and the service were very good we had a sandwich which was bigger than some other airlines with a choice of complimentary drinks for both legs. Overall Aegean Air is a very good airline as it claims to be. I would fly again with them if I have a chance. Too bad they don't fly long haul routes but they only fly regional routes.
133,MUC-SKG-ATH-HER-MUC: All flights on time with smiles clean aircraft and decent catering. Overall impeccable and a pleasure to fly!
134,I flew from JFK to EZE on October 2/14. The flight left on time and arrived on time. I travelled in Club Condor. The service was friendly and efficient. New A330 aircraft. The Club Condor seat was an inclined flat seat. I found the seat to be hard and the angle for sleep was not comfortable. I put the seat into a cradle configuration and was able to relax more and sleep for several hours. The food needs improvement - presentation taste and variety were all lacking and considering the price paid to sit upfront I expected better. The entertainment system was good. There were a lot of movies to chose from. There were several places to charge my devices. I would fly with Aerolineas again.
135,Travelled from Madrid to Buenos Aires in May as the starting point of my South-American holidays. Reasonable prices and a remarkably good service all along the flight. There was a wide range of food to choose including delightful Argentinean beef. Check-in was fast and simple and the flight had no delays at all.
136,Montevideo-Aeroparque-AsunciÃ³n. I have to say that there is an improvement in the service. Still there are delays and poor customer service on the ground. But on board there are new and comfortable planes and nice and attentive FA. Connecting in Aeroparque (Buenos Aires city airport) is always fast and easy. First leg delayed connection on time. Bags arrived at my destination with me.
137,"My wife and I flew AeroMexico for the first time this past June. We didn't know what to expect but were extremely pleased. The planes we flew to and from Cancun were new and clean. Screens at every seat. Great service from staff. kicker is that I somehow managed to lose my iPhone on the way back home. I thought it must have been at the Cancun Airport so I called them a few times to check the lost and found. Nothing. Then about three days after my flight I got a call from AeroMexico that they had discovered my phone on the plane. I hadn't even informed them that it was missing because I checked my seat area and was fairly sure that it wasn't there. Honestly I don't even know how they managed to figure out whose phone it was. They may have had to call multiple people in our area of the plane. Anyway I went back to the airport and remarkably, they had my phone. I was relieved and extremely impressed. Needless to say I would highly recommend this airline to anyone flying to/from Mexico. And they are linked to Delta so I believe your points will accrue as Skymiles. "
138,YYZ to DUB to EDI return. Transatlantic flights were excellent good IFE system pleasant staff and acceptable food. Big problem was connection in Dublin long walk through terminal and had to clear security again even though we were in the flight connection route. This does not happen at Heathrow so not sure why Dublin can't fix it. We were running to make the Toronto flight as security had only 1 of 3 lanes open.
139,I took a flight from Netherlands to New Delhi via Moscow airport dated 16th December. I read all the reviews and statistics to check the possibility of any flight cancellation. Most of the reviews were negative but the stats were sound showing there were not significant delays. I was primarily hoping for 2 things 1). On time flight 2). Safe arrival of luggage. The flight from Amsterdam airport to Moscow (2 hours time) didn't had inflight entertainment. The other flight from Moscow to New Delhi (6 hours 20 minutes duration) had good inflight entertainment system. The quality of food was OK was not at its best. There were no delays in the connecting flights. I had to board from Terminal E to Terminal F which was nearby some 700 meters walking distance. However there were some issues with Moscow Airport - i). To my wonder the security staff was missing and the passengers had to wait for odd 20 minutes. They came scanned the handbags and put stamp on 'boarding pass' ii). the mini trolleys which are otherwise freely available on Amsterdam airport were simply unavailable. The passengers carrying hand bags had to face difficulty in rushing between terminals iii). The sign boards in Moscow airport are not mountedpositioned at appropriate locations. The travelers sometimes have to take U turn to go the correct direction.
140,"Boeing 777 from Moscow to Hanoi: good leg space comfortable chair excellent inflight entertainment with many new movies tv-series. The food was average but not bad. They serve wine (ok quality) but no beer. After dinner the flight attendants ""disappear"" but react quickly to the calling light."
141,Airbus 320 from Moscow to Brussels: good leg space comfortable chair but a bit cramped in the 3-3 layout. No inflight entertainment but luckily only a 4 hours flight. Food average but ok. They serve wine (not bad) but no beer.
142,Having read favourable reviews of this airline I had been looking forward to my flight from Athens to LHR. The aircraft an Airbus A321 was full but loading was well organised and my economy seat had decent legroom although was on the hard side. I was looking forward to my usual gin and tonic and was disappointed to discover that there was to be no drinks service on this four hour flight. The meal was eventually served on a chaotic tray the salad comprised small amounts of grated carrot and cabbage and the hot main was a pea and potato stew of strange flavour. The high-light of the meal was the small roll and cheese triangle! The bottle of red wine offered with the meal undrinkable. Two weeks earlier I had flown economy class LHR to Istanbul with British Airways and enjoyed the usual high standard of service I that I always seem to find on their flights.
143,We flew from Athens to Rhodes 2 weeks ago fantastic airline short flight had sweets and soft drinks plenty of leg room.
144,Even though Aerolineas Argentinas has received too many complaints from customers recently my flight from Sao Paulo Brazil to Buenos Aires Argentina on March 1 2014 in Premium Economy Class was great and I have no complaints. The flight was on schedule the flight crew were polite and helpful. Aerolineas Argentinas' premium economy class is the same as most US companies' domestic first class. The seats are J seats very comfortable and the food in this class was also a great sandwich yoghurt and a chocolate muffin. Compared to service in the same route provided by Brazilian companies I have flown and comparing also the price Aerolineas Argentinas Premium Economy class is far better in service and mainly in seat comfort!
145,"Plane left late, but the staff tried to do their best. The space between seats was good so the trip was confortable. There was no option for the menu, and the taste was not the best, but time passed away and we arrived with no more troubles"
146,LHR - Shannon A319 - Aer Lingus bought these aircraft from Portugal and promised to reconfigure the seating but have not done so. Seat rows after 9 are extremely uncomfortable for any one over average height. Flight crew were aware of this but according to discussions multiple customer complaints have not had any impact. Select a forward row for comfort.
147,Well what to say a single Business Class flight to JFK from Dublin. Ordinarily I would hate such flights but the price and nature of the Aer Lingus flight was exceptional the cabin crew were dedicated and tended to my every need providing a friendly a fun flight to New York. The seats were very comfortable and I was greeted with champagne upon arrival the inflight entertainment was highly varied with some real classic films as well as many block buster movies and TV shows. The flight departed on time. The only slight drawback currently is the fact the seats do not lie completely flat that being said you still have more than enough room to relax. When I raised this with staff they discussed how their will apparently soon be changes made to put in place those seats that do lie completely flat as other airlines have begun to put them into place. Overall the flight was incredibly relaxing and I would book long haul with Aer Lingus in a heartbeat for flying out of Dublin the service is exceptional and business class was an unforgettable experience.
148,Went back to US on an 11.50 am flight from Dublin to Boston. Worst flight I have had. 3 out of 6 hours of my flight was spent having to listen to a toddler with his non-stop and very loud crying which the parents didn't exert much effort to stop on top of a seat that doesn't recline. My back hurts so bad. This is just one of the minor things the airline should have a regular maintenance check on to provide more comfort to their customers specially for a long flight.
149,"I flew HKG-SVO-LED and back in the past week. The seats were really comfortable on both legs; however legroom could be improved (I'm 5""8) and it was pretty cramped in the A330-300 however on the A320 the legroom was sufficient. Food was really good compared with other airlines and I was quite satisfied with Aeroflot's service. On the last flight from SVO-HKG that I took today all economy passengers received medium-haul amenity kits from Business class which was surprising as there was only a pair of slippers and eye-shades on the first leg. Overall I really enjoyed the flight and I'll definitely be taking Aeroflot again in the near future!"
150,I flew from Copenhagen to Tokyo with a stop-over en Moscow SVO. It was a very positive experience. Aeroflot has gone through a large modernization programme in the recent years and it was very evident when I travelled with them. Most of their fleet now consists of modern airliners such as the A320 the A330 and the Boeing 777. I flew on their A320 from CPH to SVO. For a short-haul flight the onboard service was extremely good compared to most European airlines. The food consisted of fresh bread cheese beef and a delicious cake and the cabin crew were serving cold and hot drinks throughout the whole flight. The crew was extremely friendly. Since the plane was only half full many of the passengers were lying down across the seats. The cabin crew immediately offered them blankets and pillows to make them more comfortable. This is the first time I have experienced this on a European flight. The transfer at SVO was smooth and easy. The airport has been renovated and now offers an easy access between the terminals without having to go outside the airport. The passport and security check took less than 10 minutes much to my surprise and I was now standing in Terminal D which had a wide selection of restaurants shops as well as free WiFi. The flight to Tokyo was on an A330. The interior felt fresh and new and the seats were very comfortable although for a tall guy such as myself the legroom left much to be desired but that is not the fault of the airline. The cabin crew on this flight were fluent in English and Japanese. Again very friendly people. There was a passenger in front of me who seemed rather anxious about flying and kept calling the crew throughout the whole flight. They never ignored his calls or talked bad to him. They kept smiling and did what they could to make him feel comfortable. The food was again very tasty and the menu offered both Russian and Japanese dishes and despite the rather cramped space I had a very comfortable flight to Tokyo. I have read many negative reviews about Aeroflot and I will not deny that people might have had some bad experiences but my opinion on Aeroflot is that it is a modern airline that offers some of the cheapest tickets in the world while maintaining a high standard in customer service. I have already booked my next flight with Aeroflot and I will continue to fly with them whenever possible.
151,Flew Business class from Tehran to Moscow Aircraft A321 clean inside no entertainment at all. Flight attendants polite but lacked professionalism as they forgot about handing out wet towels and two or three of them were sleeping in the last row of business class during this very early morning hour departure. This is simply unacceptable. The performance level by the crew was very different from what I have experienced on other sectors.
152,I have been disappointed with this airline on many occasions especially the fact that somehow they seem to hate jetsteps and they seem to favour the good old diesel buses from plane to terminal. In June after a long flight from PHL to MUC this airline was the only one to drive us around to the plane for Athens in a bus! Recent flight from LCA on 22/8 delayed 35 minutes arrived in Athens with delay. Good old bus to terminal what a pity. Aircraft seating is rather cramped for tall guys covered with plastic leather not really good for hot climates and worst of all the sandwiches were packed full with mayonnaise. Most passengers strongly complained and threw them away. Aegean could be good if they decide to eliminate such problems and make use of modern facilities not the good old diesel bus.
153,BRU-ATH ATH-BRU. Jul 20 2013 and Aug 11 2013. Aegean always exceeds expectations. Attentive and courteous cabin crew clean aircraft and comfortable seats. Above and beyond!
154,RHO-ATH-FCO. This should be listed as a 4-star airline. Clean new planes excellent meals featuring Greek items and the most courteous FA's I have encountered in years. A pleasure to fly!
155,Athens to London Heathrow with A321. Very clean aircraft very helpful crew and tasty food. Very nice take off and landing.
156,Rio to Buenos Aires AEP on 737. Departure delayed by 30min and arrival to AEP slightly behind schedule. Plane in good condition (must say that the new livery looks better than the old one). Sandwich and drink offered during flight. Crew fine. AEP is easy to navigate. Luggage (priority tagged as FB Elite) arrived fairly quickly and first on band. Was dreading flying AR but flight was overall fine. Planning to fly them long haul in C class from Spain in May.
157,AEP-MDZ MDZ-AEP in a new embraer. Really satisfied with the service. A small beverage offered with some 'alfajores' to eat. Nice trip in both ways and both legs on time. Really impressed by improvement of Aerolineas compared with its competitors in Europe. Small entertainment offered with Argentinean music videos and TV shows. Fantastic.
158,"Check-in was fast. Our plane was  comfortable. Each traveler had access to a touchscreen tv. We were able watch movies, tv shows, music videos and listen to music. They also provided croissant sandwich along with snacks and drinks. We arrived on time and without any problems. Thank you Aeromexico for your excellent service."
159,"I was more worried about the baggage fees than the airline, come to find out that Aeromexico allows 1 carry on and first checked bag for free up to 50 pounds. The plane that we took from Dallas to Mexico City was a nice plane, 2 seater instead of 3, they served us a Ham and Cheese croissant, peanuts, juice, water, beer, liqour, whatever we wanted. Smooth ride, nice landing, made it to Mexico City, from there we took a bigger plane but a little bit older, still a smooth ride and landing. On the way back from Cancun we were in a very nice plane with our own TV, headphones, several movies to choose from. My experience flying with Aeromexico was really good, nothing to complain about."
160,NCL-DUB-NCL (Operated by Stobart Air). Short hop across the Irish Sea. By far a more preferable experience to that offered by Ryanair: no check in queue pleasant staff on-time boarding and departure and arrival into the new Terminal 2 at Dublin airport. Bags also delivered rapidly at both ends. On-board the (brand new) ATR aircraft the seats were comfortable and spacious. A bar and snack service (for cash) was offered. The only slight niggle was the ridiculously long Aer Lingus check in queue on the return home (Sunday evening). 50 minutes from start to finish. They do have a 'late check-in' desk and regularly have to announce flights that are closing and direct people to this desk to avoid missing flights!
161,We flew from Stockholm to Moscow in July. Short 2 hour flight on a new A320 not the old Soviet era planes I was expecting which was good. Flight attendants well groomed spoke barely little English but were helpful enough. Didn't have any of the food because it was a short flight. Plane left and arrived on time Aeroflot was fine for a quick short haul flight no complaints. Moscow airport on the other hand.
162,I traveled with my two daughters 18 and 13 years old respectively from Dulles International Airport to Moscow with Athens as our final destination. Getting there was a bit stressful because the flight connection was too close for comfort and we had to run to make the Athens flight. The crew was rather parochial. They did not speak much English and their manners were not the best. Food was poor but not horrible. Movie choices pretty decent and the actual flights were very smooth. The pilots were quite good judging by the take offs and landings. The price was unbeatable and though this was not stellar service I would choose again if their prices remained low.
163,I traveled from Tel Aviv to Toronto via Moscow. It was a last minute booking the price superb and the service excellent - especially for economy class. The food was on par for international flights but I really appreciated the courtesy of the staff. I would not hesitate to fly Aeroflot again.
164,The thought of spending a total of 17 hours on Aeroflot and 10 hours in SVO between flights was somewhat frightening. The stay at SVO was as bad as anticipated. However the two Aeroflot flights much exceeded expectations spotlessly clean very new planes decent food better than expected IFE excellent service. The price was right.
165,Fantastic service in business from MUC to SKG. Full service on a 1.5hr flight with many choices. Please change your seats in business class this is a normal economy seat with the middle seat blocked. Not comfortable in comparison for what you pay.
166,Automated check in at El. Venizelou Airport was not easy for this first timer and while I could chalk it up to my age other passengers were also having difficulty. At 6:30 am there weren't enough ground staff to help make the process any easier but I finally managed on my own. It has the potential to be a great improvement once the bumps are ironed out. Found seating cramped and the fact that the seats do not recline a real disadvantage. Fortunately it was only a 3 hour flight but I had counted on making up for lost sleep and that proved to be impossible.
167,I took 3 domestic flights (Aeroparque-Salta Menodza-Bariloche in Y and Bariloche-Aeroparque in C-Class) with Aerolineas Argentinas in the last 3 weeks. Each flight was leaving and arriving on time the crew were nice though not all of the crew members spoke English. The snacks as well as the drinks offered were rather boring but free of charge. The planes were comfortable enough for the short flights especially the brand new Embraer of Air Austral with IFE in each seat were great!
168,My wife daughter and I travelled from Gatwick to Chicago via Dublin on 23rd July. The flight to Dublin had 'no frills' but was more comfortable than a recent flight on another Irish budget airline. The 3 hours transfer time at Dublin was partially taken up with clearing US immigration and the rest with sitting waiting for the on time flight to Chicago. The cabin crew were mature and efficient and the meal was very acceptable and served two hours into the flight. When we arrived on time in Chicago because all the paperwork had been done we were able to walk out of the airport without hassle after collecting our baggage. The return flight on 14th August had a younger cabin crew who provided a more lively friendly but equally efficient service. The Beef meal was very tasty and the cheese and ham croissant just before landing was welcome. A word of warning during the transfer at Dublin outbound and inbound further scanning was carried out on our hand baggage. The duty free bottle was accepted as the seal on the bag had not been broken and we had the receipt but a small bottle of wine from the aircraft which I had kept to drink later was confiscated even though it was unopened. I had read some of the 'horror reviews before flying but our experience did not match them and we would happily fly with the Aer Lingus again. The moderate inconvenience of transferring in Dublin was worth it to save at least Â£200 pounds each on a direct flight.
169,St Petersburg - Moscow. Ticket purchased at last minute and check in a bit confusing directed to about three different counters but each without a large queue. Flight was comfortable and only a few minutes late arriving in Moscow. No IFE but it was only a little more than a hour long flight. Cabin crew were friendly and responsive and spoke reasonable English. It was like a shuttle flight and perfectly adequate. Leg room was adequate.
170,"Like I indicated below - nothing but excellent. Flew from LAX to Mokba and back. Very outstanding service. Check in easy quick and efficient. The food flying back from Mokba was very good. Sat in the first row right were the bathrooms are and was very impressed how ALL flight attendants were constantly checking and cleaning the bathrooms (our American airlines should really take notice of that. Their bathrooms are not clean - to say the least). Also the flight stats are throughout the whole flight very nicely displayed - including nearest towns at what direction and distance - never saw that with our airlines. It also shows ""pilot view"" of take-off and landing - loved that. Actually could recognize all people on the ground shortly before touch down watching the descending airplane at LAX with flashes going off like crazy. In the future I will try to book Aeroflot wherever available."
171,Omsk - St Petersburg. Flew this sector 10 days after surgery and was pleased with the flights. No real express check in but express lane for security and a lounge in Omsk. Good food on both flights and comfortable space. No inflight entertainment - I had my own and the both flights on time. Luggage was amongst the first off in St Petersburg (a big plus given a transit in Moscow). Cabin crew spoke good English (again a noticeable improvement over the past few years). Aeroflot seems to be the best of the Russian Airlines.
172,Flew London Heathrow to Athens and back. Great cabin crew very friendly. Food is rather good (for airline food)! Beverage service is excellent. Enjoyed the extra legroom and the leather seats.
173,Larnaca - Rhodes return. Both flights on time comfy seats and friendly cabin crew. No inflight entertainment probably because it was a short flight but a good experience to fly with Aegean.
174,DUS to ATH and 4 days later from ATH to HER. Both flights on time very quick check-in and boarding. Very friendly and attentive efficient staff good service excellent melas even for the short hub from ATH to HER. It will remain our preferred carrier to and from Greece.
175,Dramatic improvement - would use them again. They have obviously spent a lot of money over the past 3 years on new planes with in-flight entertainment. Service was friendly and our flights on time (AEP-SCL).
176,"Flew 2 legs- MID-MEX on ""Connect"" brand and then MEX-YYZ. The MID-MEX leg was operated by an E190 no IFE and the snacks were average peanuts but the seats were comfortable and due to the length of the flight it wasn't important. The second leg was on a 737-700. The seats were comfortable and very nice blankets were provided however the IFE was quite limited (overhead screens that played movies and nothing else and were shut off 3 quarters into the flight) so I would recommend bringing your own entertainment if you're flying an Aeromexico 737. In flight meal was edible at most. Overall there were no major problems but they need to improve their IFE on longer flights and their food."
177,Flight 9100 and 9101 coach seating 4/3 to 4/7/15. I cannot say enough good things about or flight service through Aeromexico. The planes were clean and very comfortable loved having the option of watching a movie TV show or listening to music. The attendants were friendly and took care of us all very well. Lunch boxes were served - that's a pleasant surprise in itself! I was very impressed!
178,"Sunday 22nd February - Mexico City to LAX - Premier Class. Old aircraft with ""drop down"" shared TV screens. Service and food could not be faulted on board the aircraft. Bags did not arrive in LAX - the check in staff in Mexico City had incorrectly tagged my two bags to a flight to Miami. Long story short the bags arrived in Sydney two days later thanks to a very attentive customer service officer in the USA. Ground staff at LAX could have shown a little more empathy with my situation."
179,I use to fly with Ryanair back and forth from Dublin every few weeks. After Ryanair changed their flight times to Dublin which did not help me I changed to Aer Lingus. The staff are friendly and always smiling the planes are comfortable and the times of the flights are fantastic. The prices are always a little higher than the other company's but I would not change back.
180,My family and I flew from Moscow to Istanbul Ataturk in economy class. For the money is not expensive. The plane for this flight was a brand new A320 with sharklets. Unfortunately without a TV. The dinner was nice. Cabin crew with beauty red uniform were always respectful cheerful and ready to help. Pilots masters of their craft. Like for duty-free sales on board. All in all a great experience. Would definitely recommend and travel with them again.
181,Flew LAX-SVO-Yervan and back I was concerned having heard mixed reviews but was pleasantly surprised! Flights were on time baggage arrived perfectly the colors and atmosphere on the plane was bright and cheery. I flew economy so like any other airlines you get what you pay for as far as cabin space however in all other respects Aeroflot was superior. Cabin crew were professional and polite food was quite good. Entertainment was superb with 100's of great movies and shows to choose from as well as games wifi charging stations and all the works! I travelled with my children 4 and 7 and had no trouble keeping them busy for 12 hours. Children's meals can be pre-ordered and were well thought out although my picky ones didn't eat them. Kids got tons of goodies from the staff. The value was great and I will fly with them again in the future. My only complaint were the tiny and rather dirty bathrooms. Otherwise excellent airline!
182,Flight from MAD to Shanghai with transfer in Moscow. Good airline in general terms. Meals as other alternatives but no alcohol served. Seats and leg room are OK. They offer Space + seats located in the emergency exists and prices are reasonable. Cabin crew no friendly enough from my point of view if I compare with other airlines to flight to China like BA Finnair or AF. The main difference is that they provide slippers and eye masks no offered by other airlines. Cabin and toilets are clean enough. Moscow airport is awful and really boring. Distances between terminals and gates are too much long. Flights arrived on time. Entertainment system only in English and Russian. Music selection is OK.
183,Flew Istanbul-Athens. Plane was new and clean staff warm and friendly and they served drinks and a sandwich on this 1-hour flight. This airline deserves more than a 3-star ranking in my opinion.
184,STR-SKG-ATH-TLV. Slightly delayed departure in STR but arrival on time in ATH after short stop in SKG. Great food and good selection of beverages. Departure from ATH was several hours delayed due to striking ground staff. Received vouchers for snacks. Definitively recommended.
185,Prague to Athens. Nice A320 good crew. However its standards are far below under its competitor - Czech Airlines.
186,Shanghai to Tehran return July 2012. Direct flight to Tehran. Economy class. Aircraft A310. Fare was quite good. Check-in fast. Cabin crew showed Iranian hospitality. No individual inflight entertainment but fairly speaking since the flight was at night. One toilet closed for whole trip the other two were not clean and almost out of tissue. Food was enough and fine for me. Many drink options. Flying time was less than 10 hours on my way to Tehran and less than 8 on the way back to Shanghai. Considering all the above I will certainly choose this airline next time for my trip to Tehran.
187,DXB-IKA. A300-600 aircraft clean cabin with friendly flight attendants variety of meals were good but the quality of meal was very poor.
188,Flew from LHR thru MEX to PVR. Was my first time on the Dreamliner. It's a beautiful aircraft and the AeroMexico service and comfort the best I've experienced in long-haul tourist class. Formalities and connection at MEX Term 2 very efficient. Domestic flight to PVR on very comfortable Embraer 190.
189,AM 681. Flew YUL-MEX on a new 737-800 for the second time. Cabin was in great condition. Food service on this flight was much better than on my previous flights with Aeromexico in Clase Premier. Cabin crew were excellent and very professional. The purser knew each of the business class passenger's last names (there were 16 of us) and she was always around to see if she was needed. I fell asleep and she left me a drink and peanuts for when I woke up. Aeromexico staff is usually just OK - they are efficient but are cold and tend to disappear into the galley afterwards. This was not the case in this flight when there was always a flight attendant in the cabin (even in economy class). Great flight overall wish all crews performed this way.
190,LGW-BHD EI021 31 July 14. Excellent customer service and particularly impressed with clear communication and politeness of cabin manager on this flight. A320 seats much more comfortable than the A319s that EI also operate on this route.
191,Flight from Amsterdam to Tokyo Narita via SVO and back. First flight from AMS to SVO on codeshare flight with KLM on B738. Flight was OK. Transit on SVO from terminal E to D was a breeze. There were no lines at immigration or security check. As we had a stopover for 6 hours we used the capsule hotel which was accessible from terminal D and E on airside (63 Euros for 4 hours). Flight from SVO to NRT was on an A333. Nice and new aircraft with good seats and complete IFE. We had 4 seats in a row for the two of us as the aircraft was about half full. Crew was attentive and quitte friendy. With one hour delay we arrived at NRT. The flight from NRT back to SVO gave us however some mixed emotions. on an A333 but with a crew that wasn't as friendly as the flight to NRT. We got the feeling we were bothering them even with some basic requests for drinks. Toilets were very dirty on this flight not only the fault of the crew as well as fellow passengers. Transit from terminal D to E on SVO was a mess. At immigration and security check there were long lines with a lot of people cutting lines. Flight from SVO to AMS on an A320 was better than the flight from NRT. Aircraft was however in a bit of a run down state and also quite dirty. Toilet was also in a poor state. The crew however was extremely friendly and flight arrived on time. In the end Aeroflot gave us mixed feelings. If you don't have many expectations for the price you pay for the flight the airline is OK. At SVO you need either luck or a lot of patience concerning transits of flights. If we would fly again with this airline really depends on the price of the flights they offer.
192,"I flew Aeroflot 4 times over the last 15 days. From HK to Moscow Moscow to UK UK to Moscow Moscow home. The first leg was ""bearable"" if a little short on snacks and food options - so much so that the first thing I did was to buy a little bag of peanuts to go in my carry on. The second leg was uncomfortable due to the shell seats which are nothing sort of a torture device. Two weeks pass before the third leg which was same seats same limited choice of movies and even the same food. The fourth leg - the entertainment system took around an hour to load. Same movies even though it was a different month! But the real issue for me was the meal. With almost every meal they serve 2 pieces of bread. The white ""loaf"" is always icy cold and hard. The little brown slice was also cold and hard. There was not enough butter for both. Given the price I paid for my ticket I didn't expect gourmet food but the piece of salmon was literately the size of a teaspoon. The chicken was barely warm. Usually the food is served piping hot and even if the bread is not heated if you leave your roll on top of your main meal you can get a bit of heat and steam into it. No such luck. The dessert - there was nothing to eat it with in the utensil pack was exactly what it looked like tasteless overly sweet faux cream. Breakfast I chose the pancakes which I was unable to eat they were far too sweet. I was pretty hungry by the time we landed."
193,RIX-SVO-PVG and back. From RIX to SVO it was a partner flight with Air Baltic. Then came the horror of SVO-PVG. I had no option to choose seats. I was asked in RIX while checking in for seat preference and I said aisle. I did get one for RIX-SVO and for SVO-PVG I got a 28th row which on their A330 is in front of the toilets and the seat does not recline. The seats were rather worn and entertainment system was slow though the selection of media was excellent. The food was plain insulting with 2cm of salmon sliced over some canned carrots and peas presented as a salad. The bun was hard and the choice of main course was chicken or fish for dinner and chicken or goulash for the supper. The dessert was surprisingly good though I had to wait 40 minutes for the tea to have it with while they were finishing servicing everyone. And now for the best part the service. Apparently they are split in the teams of 2 with some kind of good cop / bad cop principle as in both aisles we've seen one was making attempts to smile and the other one was plain offensive. The bathrooms were hardly cleaned the pilots announcements were hardly audible. So imagine my surprise when on the return flight from Shanghai to Moscow I was greeted by a very professional and helpful staff (still not smiling) got into a very comfortable seat of a brand new shiny 777 with plenty of room even with 3-4-3 scheme great new entertainment system with touchscreen much fresher air and the food was really delicious including a very fresh bun. The short flight SVO-RIX was also very pleasant with a nice little airbus with sufficient space a delicious chicken sandwich and soft drinks and the sweetest flight attendant. To sum it all I'd say its a real hit and miss thing with Aeroflot. Stay away from the airbus on the long flights make sure its a 777 they're great. If you're unlucky enough to get airbus steer clear of row 28. The food probably depends on where they get it. The entertainment is excellent on long flights tons of good movies TV shows and music. Do not expect a good polite service on every flight. Other than that flights were on time with great connections and very reasonably priced.
194,The flight departed from CDG just a little bit late. But the service was extremely good. Served pasta drinks and hot bread. 3hrs flying time. On time arrival in Athens. Air fare was rather fair.
195,Flew ATH-DME-ATH. The entire experience from check-in to landing was superb. Clean aircraft with decent seat comfort kind and smiley flight attendants. Both flights on time. They served a hot meal which was good enough and they served cold & hot drinks like 5 times during the flights. Overall a great experience.
196,Two flights from Milan Malpensa to Athens both on time both on the airbus A320. Staff very kind. Fresh food was good but I'd rather have something hot. The aircraft was very clean. The onboard magazine was good and interesting written in Greek and in English.
197,I flew from Sydney to Buenos Aires and then to Bogota with Aerolineas Argentinas last week and then returned the same way a few days later. The aircraft appeared very new and I have absolutely no complaints about seats or bathroom or cleanliness. The food was as good as any I have had on Qantas and the staff were as good or nearly so.
198,I took three flights in November. Buenos Aires (AEP) to Cordoba Cordoba to Mendoza and Mendoza to Buenos Aires (AEP). They were award tickets through Sky Team (Delta) points. I was a little apprehensive after reading the comments here but in my case the flights all left close to on time and the aircraft were nearly new. Seating was comfortable and space was adequate. On each flight there was a beverage service and small snack box.
199,I have been using Aeromexico for several years for business travel from Chicago to various locations throughout Mexico. They have multiple direct flights. I have been happy with their service both at the counter at the gate and on the airplane. The planes seem to be maintained well and bathrooms and seating areas are clean. Service is pleasant and professional without trying to be cute during announcements. The food to me just seems to be a little better the service a bit more professional and the areas cleaner than everyone else. Again much of what one views is based on perceptions and a few negative things can color one's view. In my case I see so many small positive things that it has probably colored my view of Aeromexico in a good way.
200,AM 423 Nov 27 2014. AM 422 Dec 2 2014. I have flown from Miami to Mexico and back many times. For several years I made the trip once a month. I have flown on every airline that services Mexico City from Miami. AeroMexico beats them all. Basic friendliness refreshments and snacks prompt departures and arrivals reasonable and competitive fares all without the ubiquitous add-ones and charges of other airlines. I will adjust my schedule to fly this airline every time. This trip was the first in several years and it didn't disappoint. Keep it up I'm a big fan.
201,Dublin to SFO - good seat space good inflight entertainment pleasant crew flight on time dinner and snack tasted good. From SFO to Dublin - all was good as above except for the meals these were tasteless.
202,Dublin to San Francisco return. Outward journey via Boston (second leg with Jetblue which was great) as the direct flight was sold out for days around my date of travel. Thankfully got one of the last seats on the direct flight on the return journey. Business class wasn't in the budget for this trip but the seats in economy were fine (I'm 6'0'' tall). I ordered one of the special meals for the Boston flight which was well worth it had the regular meal from SFO to DUB which was fine and you could help yourself to drinks and snacks from the galley at any time. The service is consistent the aircraft's always immaculate the personal entertainment has plenty of choice and the staff generally very friendly and helpful. You can select most seats on the aircraft for free at time of booking. Lets hope AL go daily on this route in 2015.
203,DUB-LHR LHR-DUB check in at T2 Dublin a breeze. Quiet flight on the way out got away early nice friendly and attentive cabin crew for the short flight. More or less the same on the way back but T1 at Heathrow looking tired. Although I'm happy to use Aer Lingus again in the near future and will be great to see the end of T1 at Heathrow when they move to the new terminal!
204,Moscow to Berlin in business. Check-in was a breeze with a smile. Lounge at SVO pretty decent. Seats on A-320 great and greeted with choice of drinks including champagne. Cabin crew very friendly and spoke good English. I speak some Russian and was treated always with smile. Lunch very tasty. Beats Lufthansa Business any day. Captain did three announcement with good English. Flight on time would highly recommend Aeroflot on European flights anytime.
205,It was my first flight with Aeroflot from LAX to Rome Italy through Moscow. It was a very pleasant flight and definitely will fly them again. The flight was on time the food excellent FA's were very polite and in Moscow City Aeroport Sheremetyevo the accommodation was superb. There is a Capsule hotel on 3rd floor and for 4 hours $103 we got a nice clean room with comfortable beds and a bathroom.
206,Will try my best to be objective since our luggage have not arrived (even a week later). TLV-SVO-CAN and back May/June 2014. Short leg - B-777-300 excellent seats and room. Long leg: SVO-CAN 10 hrs. A-330-300 excellent seats and room. Return flight: CAN-SVO A-330 and Short leg: A-330-300 the seats were cramped. Crew on all flights were very nice and efficient. Food was boring you get 2 meals on the long legs however they were almost the same. Flights were almost on time and inflight entertainment normal.
207,LED-SVO-STR. Very good experience overall. Both flights were on-time and comfortable. The planes were very clean and the cabin crews were very friendly and professional. 1) On LED-SVO I put the sandwich in my bag as I was not hungry at that time. The flight attendant who was serving tea/coffee saw I did not have a sandwich on my tray table so she asked me very kindly in English whether I was hungry and why not take a sandwich for snack. 2) On SVO-STR after I walked into the back cabin the flight attendant greeted me and offered to guide me to my seat. 3) The SVO-STR flight (3hrs) included a full lunch with a very generous portion of cold cut salmon and potato salad as the starter and lamb and buckwheat as the main course. The dessert was a granola bar with honey chocolate cherry and apple coating. It was very tasty! Overall from my 4 flights with Aeroflot within two weeks I have to say the level of service is quite good and consistent. I think it is really time to change the stereotype that many of us had for the Russian national carrier for many years!
208,ATH to RHO on an A320-200. Boarding and take-off a bit late but nevertheless it arrived as expected to Rhodes airport. Cabin was clean and shinny and the crew very friendly and looking elegant in their (well designed) uniforms. Seats fairly comfortable and all leather dressed even in economy. One thing I don't like in Aegean aircraft cabins is the seat-plan which makes the cabin feel a bit crowded in fully booked flights. Snack and drink ok nothing special for a short flight but ok. Flight was nice and smooth landing was great. Overall a pleasant and comfortable flight. I think Aegean's reputation as a quality European airline is well deserved.
209,FRA-SKG in Economy operated by Aegean Airlines. Bit fussy boarding at FRA and slightest delay due to late incoming aircraft. Shiny new cabin on A320-200 attentive and welcoming staff. Overhead monitors for safety instructions and a flight show. Brilliant hot meal on 2 hour flight accompanied by appetizer (warm roll/butter/mini crackers/spread cheese) and selection of Greek wines in little bottles (not by glass) a dessert and two rounds of very decent coffee. Smooth landing on time. Absolutely recommended.
210,Aegean started regular non-stop flights between IEV and ATH in Spring 2013. The A320 was 6 years old the cabin was quite ok inside. Seems like the company's making effort to keep their planes clean. Flight attendants were just doing their job without being extra attentive. Catering included Greek cuisine and was good but not substantial - no meat was offered in the meals fine for vegetarians. Inflight entertainment meant magazines and music no TVs or anything else on that particular aircraft. The flight was on time no issues with the baggage. Overall experience is good would definitely fly again for a reasonable price.
211,Santa Cruz to Cochabamba Cochabamba to La Paz. This airline tries hard to fill the gap left by the collapse of Aero Lloyd Boliviano but is still plagued by constant changes to schedules usually because the aircraft flying the international route (Brazil) is late in arriving in Santa Cruz and therefore delays the local flights. It also tends to overbook flights and then moves confirmed ticket holders to later flights (it is really important to reconfirm flights) and will even change flight schedules back in time so flights depart 2 hours earlier then scheduled. The airline is fine if you are not in a hurry and don't mind delayed flights changed schedules and don't mind having confirmed tickets ignored.
212,Flew Austral economy from Sao Paulo-Buenos Aires-Mendoza-Santiago. All in EMB190 jets. Only the Mendoza to Santiago flight were on time. Service was ok and the seats were quite comfortable with a good pitch.
213,JFK to CUN 10/8/14 flight 417. Return flight 416 on 10/16/14. Excellent airline. Starting from check in all associates were friendly and helpful. Personal entertainment in the seat backs was perfect. 1st checked bag free is always appreciated. Food was great and also a bonus as it was served at no charge and with smiling associates. Aeromexico is a new favorite airline of mine.
214,Excellent service and courteous employees. I flew from Puerto Vallarta and had to change planes in Mexico City for flight to Los Angeles. One glitch - my bag was put on a later flight ( about 30 to 40 minutes) along with 20 to 30 other travelers. It was frustrating standing around and wondering until an announcement was finally made.
215,I had never flown AeroMexico prior to my first visit to Mexico in October/November 2014. I was impressed that they have a new modern fleet comprising 777s and the 787 Dreamliner. The check in process at the counters in Mexico City was very expedient and friendly. The boarding and departure were timeous. The service onboard for the quick domestic flight to Oaxaca was super friendly and cheerful. I cannot fault this airline. It was a better experience than most domestic airlines I fly in Australia.
216,The problem with Aeromexico is the inconsistency in the airplanes. Flew MEX-CCS- MEX a couple of times in business class in an old wear out 737-700. Shared TV screen seat that resemble the old American Airlines business class. Then I have flown GDL-MEX in the 737-800 what a difference. Service is nice they treat you well but definitely they need to vamp up the Clase Premier Product.
217,Have taken Aer Lingus from the US (Chicago and NY) several times and am very impressed. The planes are new the seats reasonably comfortable (good leg room and we are tall people) the food fine and good selections on the personal TV/Movie screens. No problems with being on time staff was friendly and efficient. I was especially impressed when we got into Dublin a bit late and were personally escorted through the lines in order to make our connection on to Paris. Never had that happen with any airline before! I would fly Aer Lingus again.
218,BRU-DUB. I am regular flyer on this route normally on 10.20am flights. What is going on with the re-instated check-in / bag drop queues at Brussels? I say re-instated because after online check-in finally came to BRU airport there have never been any issues with this flight in either checking in or dropping bag lines in Brussels. However last two times in June and this morning there were huge queues on both the Aer Lingus check-in line and bag drop/Gold circle line. And they both seem to advance eternally slow. Why does it seem to take so long per passenger to simply drop off a bag? I ended up getting fed up and bypassing altogether and brought my bag through security and got it checked at gate which is an added nuisance but one time I had skipped breakfast and really needed to get past security to eat something before collapsing. I am not sure what is causing the problem but there seems to be some ambiguity about the queuing lines for the check-in and bag drop / gold circle and people just seem to pass no heed of which is the correct line and join one or the other whichever is shorter. I think they need some better identification or barriers between the two to snake the queues to make it work better. Or a staff member guiding people correctly.
219,"EI3281. More often than not late leaving Bristol for. dublin. The walk to passport is so long - really is there no where closer to ""park""? Should have landed 35 minutes ago and still not parked up."
220,First-time with Aeroflot. Stuttgart/STR to St. Petersburg/LED via Moscow-Sheremetyevo/SVO. Both on-time. From STR to SVO the plane was an A320 and from SVO to LED the plane was A321. The seats were very comfortable and the leg room was impressive! I am 178cm/5'10 and after sat down there was about 15cm/6in in front of my knees. In fact you can put one leg on the other without any problems. I often fly Lufthansa from Germany to Russia and in Lufthansa's A320/321 economy cabin you definitely do not see this much leg space. The food was fine. STR-SVO includes a full lunch and two rounds of drink service and SVO-LED includes a teriyaki chicken sandwich and drinks. The staffs were professional and spoke adequate amount of English. The captains of the flights each made 3 announcements in English (welcome in-flight update and a final goodbye after landing) which were quite impressive. Overall I found the trip very pleasant and Aeroflot's has exceeded my expectations! I can see clearly Aeroflot wants to improve and they are making a good effort!
221,Flew Moscow - Hong Kong (Return) on Aeroflot's A330-300. Both flights were great. Aeroflot has really stepped up their game. Both flights perfectly on-time. New aircraft fresh IFE (movies TV shows games - lots to choose from) friendly staff. Legroom could be an inch better but it seems that the rows to the back of the aircraft are worse. Food was unimaginative but edible. The crew could speak a little better English but it was sufficient. SVO airport is horrible though.
222,Flew SU2585 and SU1860 (LHR VIA SVO TO EVN). First leg was on an A321. Sufficent leg room and liked the fact the toilets were in the middle of the cabin. Food was average but I had eaten before boarding. Staff were friendly/professional and spoke English. Second leg was on an A320. Leg room was even better. Food was better than the first legs and staff once again were professional but English was limited. No IFE on either sector. I would use Aeroflot again if the fare was more competitive.
223,JTR-ATH-DME. Both times there were new A320s with comfortable seats and adequate entertainment - magazines music overhead TV screens. First flight departed with a slight delay - 10 mins but arrived on time. On this 45 mins flight the cabin crew served a cookie and all kinds of napkins (dry and refreshing) but surprisingly didn't offer any drink at all. The next flight was also on time. The catering was tasty with meat little salad and baklava. Drinks of various kinds were offered. Both times the cabin crew was smiley but didn't show much care. Baggage arrived quickly. It was also very convenient to transfer through ATH. I would recommend Aegean Airlines.
224,Flight ATH-HER-ATH. Slightly delayed (about 15 min delay in boarding/arrival times - both ways). New aircraft very clean with nice seats. Legroom more than good for a 50 min flight Overall I would recommend flying with this airline.
225,Flew Sydney - Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires - Sydney. Pros: Staff helpful. Good value for money. Cons: Seats are old and sometimes broken. Food is average they serve just 2 meals in a long flight so take some with you during the flight. Old airplane and does not have entertainment system. You need to take a tablet with you - they don't allow phones even in airplane mode. Flights delayed.
226,Rio de Janeiro to Montevideo via Buenos Aires and return via Buenos Aires and Iguazu to Rio. Mixed experience first flight left at 2.40am from Rio to Buenos Aires on an Austral Embraer 190 and due to heavy turbulence there was no inflight service whatsoever on the 3 hour flight no apologies at all from the crew which I found rude. Short hops from BA to Montevideo and back uneventful. The return legs were better. Flights left and arrived on time crews on both Embraer 190 (Austral) and B737 did their job well. Their spoken English is awful if I didn't speak Spanish I wouldn't understand a word of what they announced.
227,I really think this airline is sadly overlooked in the US market. I took a chance on them a few years back when United dropped direct flights to places in Mexico I visit and found an airline with great service modern planes and competitive prices. The flight schedules are convenient and the staff I have encountered have been friendly and helpful when I have needed them. Only once have I had a issue due to weather - and they made sure to get me on another flight and while my bags did not make it on the plane they had them secured and waiting for me the next morning. In the past 3 years I have flown with them 10+ times and have no interest in looking elsewhere.
228,1 Oct 2014  San Antonio TX - Mexico City Mexico. Mexico City Mexico - Oaxaca Mexico. I live in Oaxaca and fly regularly to San Antonio to visit family in Texas. I have found the staff particularly patient helpful and courteous with my struggles to speak Spanish. My flights have been on time and the planes clean and pleasant. One trip my connection in DF was tight and the attendant booked me on the later flight in case I missed the one I was ticketed for.
229,Flew from JFK to Shannon then Heathrow on June 7/8 then from Gatwick to Dublin to JFK on June 22. My husband is a retired Air Traffic Controller and said we were flying Aer Lingus or Icelandair only so we flew Aer Lingus. Loved it! The stewards were very nice and the crew were funny even in announcements. We did not upgrade the meal but they were great except on the way back I asked for the beef dish and she gave me the chicken which had curry and I can't eat curry. After finally getting her to stop and listen they were out of beef. I slept most the way anyway.
230,TLV-SVO and SVO-RIX. TLV-SVO was on a new A330. As is typical of the former USSR the boarding announcement was met by a scrum of people rushing the boarding gate. No attempt made by the crew to regulate boarding and as a result it took nearly an hour. Once onboard the flight attendants were generally sour and the food was stale and lukewarm. In-flight entertainment was surprisingly good but still a step down from Delta and similar airlines. Despite TLV-SVO being an overnight flight the cabin lights were never dimmed and the service was staggered in a way that essentially prevented all sleeping. Could not figure this out. SVO was pleasant enough and SVO-RIX was an easy short-hop on a new 737. No service and no complaints. Would take Aeroflot again only if the price was significantly less than other European carriers.
231,LHR-SVO return. Both flights on new and clean A330-300 though seats a bit hard and less comfortable than their A320/321 fleet. Chicken curry on flight to SVO and lamb on return flight and both quite nice. Flight attendants did not smile a lot but were professional. IFE very good with dozens of latest films and music. One thing that could be improved and that's the headphones : they do not give ear cushions and so wearing headphones is very uncomfortable even painful to ears sometimes. The sound quality is also terrible. Quite a pleasant experience on both flights and I will use Aeroflot again. For 250 which is an almost EasyJet price you get a full service package IFE and SkyPriority for a 3 hour flight.
232,SVO to MUC and back. Two-hour delay of the flight from Moscow due to military parade and air space closure - no fault of the airline. But the boarding process could and should have been organized in a better way. Wonder why the jetbridge hasn't been used. No such problems on the return flight. Both flights on A320 pretty comfortable seats decent space. Training of the staff should clearly be improved first and foremost the language skills and attitude towards passengers. At the same time a young flight assistant on the return flight at least tried to be friendly and attentive. The food was inedible on the first flight and acceptable on the way back. Entertainment should be enhanced ie. by installation of individual multimedia sets in short and medium-haul aircrafts. All in all the general experience is pretty average. The ticket price was actually quite low compared to other offers for these dates considering the flexibility in the choice of flights and the level of seat comfort is pretty good but the main thing is that Aeroflot should be training the staff harder if they want to improve their international profile. Also basing on my experience of traveling with this airline I can say that the quality of in-flight service can differ dramatically on different flights so it is sometimes really a matter of luck.
233,FRA-ATH. May 25. A321. Boarding totally messy. Excellent food and drinks. Extremely pleasant staff. Luggage arrived very quickly.
234,LHR-LCA-LHR economy. Superb inflight service three servings of drinks and appetizing hot meals. Punctuality good. Cabin crew courteous smiling and pro-active.
235,Cyprus to Athens on Aegean. An excellent flight and a great service. The staff are great and very friendly. Food was also nice. Only downside was check in which had a long queue.
236,Tucuman-Buenos Aires-Tucuman. Two good flights the first on a Boeing 737-700 departed on time and arrived 15 mins early. Flight service is efficient and cabin crew very friendly. Totally recommended.
237,The saying that you get what you pay for is spot on when it comes to Aerolineas. Great value for money if you don't have high expectations of the airline in the first place. Flight to BA was fine. No delays and food ok. The flight back however took off 2.5 hours late and then stopped in Patagonia with no explanation as to why so all up the journey took over 18 hours instead of 13.
238,Gatwick to Joburg (troubles just beginning to brew in Libya). The start seemed off putting when I noticed an extra three hours on the flight time from Tripoli to Joburg which the booking office could not explain also when I was not on the reservations list at check-in. However the latter was sorted without hassle. Service on flight to Tripoli was fine plane new and clean food good. However we landed in a sandstorm which was worrying. Fortunately we were herded along to the departures lounge as all signs in Arabic. Onward flight delayed by a couple of hours due to sandstorm. Toilets at the airport were inadequate in number but reasonably clean. We were then taken on what felt like a mystery tour on an airport bus down a dirt road - turned out to be to the other end of the runway where our plane sat all on its own amidst military aircraft. The three hour extra time was now clear as it was a much smaller plane than expected (a few passengers had seats allocated on row numbers which were not on the smaller plane - however there was enough room and extra for everyone boarding). Once again food and service fine. There was a refuelling stop at Kinshasa. During my week in S Africa the revolution in Libya took off. I expected to lose my money and have to rebook myself back on an alternative carrier. However when I contacted Afriqiyah in Joburg they said I was re-booked on Egyptair travelling back same night as my original booking. They sent me email confirmation and my trip home went smoothly. The Afriqiyah staff were helpful and efficient in spite of what was obviously a stressful time for them. On the basis of value for money Afriqiyah is excellent but be prepared for a journey with a difference.
239,Flights from San Antonio to Cuernavaca then back to Atlanta were most pleasant experiences. All the things I like to have happen when flying came together on both flights. Both were on time check in went quickly and smoothly every Aeromexico person I had contact with was professional and friendly and even boarding was quick and efficient. The meals - sandwich and candy bar - was well a sandwich but the bread was fresh and a fun sized Snickers isn't all that bad. This was my second and third flight with Aeromexico and all were very pleasant flights. I caught up on a TV show going down and a movie coming back home. For me the airline did a great job and the fare was very reasonable.
240,Flight 24. Departed at 11.55pm on Oct 20 and arrived at 12.30pm on Oct 21. Had a very positive experience with my flights to and from Mexico City to Rio de Janeiro in Premiere Class. From the gate agents to the inflight crew the service was excellent. The meals and entertainment was also very good.
241,MEX/PVR morning flight. Check-in staff forgot to put a priority tag on my luggage. Even 70min flight Business class meal was only one muffin same as Economy class. The only different thing was refilling coffee. Seat was enough big but old. It's ok because of a short haul but if it's more than 2 hours I take Economy class to save money.
242,Flew BRS-DUB-YYZ then YQG-YYZ-DUB-BRS in June 2014 as it was convenient to fly from our home airport rather than drive to London for a direct flight. Could not check in online as we had not booked directly with airline which meant an early start at the airport and no seats together. BRS-DUB with Stobart and a tiny noisy twin-prop as you might expect for such a short flight. DUB-YYZ plane looked brand new - think this route had only just started flying - and was full. 3-3 configuration felt very cramped. Drinks and food OK but not served until about 2 hours into the flight and no pre-landing snacks left by the time they got to us on the back row - we were offered a selection of biscuits instead. Service was fine apart from this. IFE selection limited and touchscreen system somewhat temperamental. Not a full-service airline so alcoholic drinks had to be paid for (we were prepared and brought euros just for this). On return YQG-YYZ sector by Air Canada - checked bags through to BRS for us. YYZ-DUB was a night flight but drinks and food again served after 2 hours water on board not working so no tea or coffee (or water in the toilets) lights not dimmed at all though a blanket and pillow were provided. Flight seemed to be on time leaving but arrived 30 mins late though no there was no mention of this or apology from the crew. It was only on the very long walk from the gate that we realised there'd been a delay and had to run then be fast- tracked through security just getting to the gate for our connecting flight as it closed behind us. Needless to say our bags didn't follow us for a couple of days. You get what you pay for and Aer Lingus were a little cheaper and a lot more convenient than other airlines for us. For a 7hr flight they were fine and I might be tempted by the convenience of the DUB US immigration pre-clearance to fly to NYC or Boston with them but I wouldn't travel any further.
243,A comfortable flight crew were pleasant but not much seat room. A little costly compared to other airlines with no direct flight from Toronto to London. Baggage amount was reduced to regional amount on way back to Toronto as we flew from Newcastle yet it was International amount from Dublin to London didn't make sense.
244,Belfast City to Heathrow on 24 May and return on 8th June A319 both ways. Found the seats hard and the leg room constrained compared to several flights of similar length on Bangkok Airways A319 in late May/early June. Would not like a three or four hour flight on these aircraft. Would only recommend if no alternative unlike EI long haul which I consider good.
245,BHX-DUB-JFK. We booked Aer Lingus because it was the most cost-effective option to New York from Birmingham with a short connection time. I was apprehensive above flying Aer Lingus based on previous reviews. The BHX-DUB sector was on an Aer Arran (now Stobart Air) ATR which was practically empty with overhead bins that accommodated carry- on's but the aircraft was very noisy. DUB-JFK was an A330 in 2-4-2 configuration. Seats and leg room were ok. Seat back TV entertainment was limited and not the most user friendly. Alcoholic beverages have to be paid for and there was only one round of soft drinks. The meal was mediocre and the pre-arrival snack was a flapjack. The crew constantly seemed in a hurry to distribute meals and drinks to the point where they practically chucked it at you before moving on. The crew then disappeared not to be seen until arrival. Whenever I fly transatlantic in economy I always seem to be disappointed. Nothing beats the middle eastern carriers on service. The only benefit of flying Aer Lingus is leaving from a local airport and the US pre-immigration clearance in Dublin which enables one to arrive in the US like a domestic passenger and avoid the lengthy immigration queues. Price however is comparable to other carriers.
246,Quick check in boarding and departure on time. We had a light dinner. I have travelled with Aegean many times and I think that on SKG-STR route they should improve catering and entertainment. Staff very friendly.
247,Paris/CDG-Athens on A321 aircraft. Wonderful service in economy class although flight was delayed for almost 3 hours due to very bad weather conditions (heavy snow). Cabin crew was one of the best I have met on a flight. Meals in Y/C need some improvement.
248,We flew return to Buenos Aries from Sydney. Condor class was not a lot more expensive than economy given the 16 hour trip. We had plenty of leg room and the food was excellent. The seats and everything seemed to function. Flights were on time and our luggage arrived on the carousel. Check in was speedy. As other reviewers noted the planes are old so I needed a cushion for lumbar support and we took tablets with books and movies downloaded. This worked very well with excellent picture and sound quality. Staff perhaps could have done more to keep others under control eg a couple immediately behind us watched videos on their laptop with no earplugs so we got the full sound while we were trying to sleep. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the trip.
249,BRU-JNB-BRU with a stopover in Tripoli. There were some troubles with the in-flight entertainment. On our way to JNB there were not enough headsets so we couldn't use the inflight entertainment. On our way back from JNB to Tripoli the inflight entertainment in our part of the plane didn't work at all. The food was okay and the cabin crew friendly. It's definitely value for money but there are some things to improve.
250,LGW-TIP-LGW on A320/A330. Both flights approx 1 hour delayed Servisair lounge at LGW basic and overcrowded quiet lounge in Tripoli. Uncrowded flights - very few pax in Business cabin. Comfortable seats for 3 hr journey but angled lie-flat seats on A330 too short for me (1.80m). Food tasty (no alcohol of course) limited but OK film choice on AVOD. FAs sweet but not all spoke english. Be aware Tripoli airport can be difficult to navigate as all signage in Arabic only!
251,Aeromexico is a good airline but there is a huge gap in quality from aircraft to aircraft for instance last week I flew from CUN to MEX in a new B737-800 excellent in every way. My next leg was MEX to TIJ in a B737-700 old cramped no inflight entertainment just one tiny bag of peanuts for a 3 hour flight toilet old and dirty. The boarding procedure AM is implementing is awful and useless. It takes longer and it is absurd. First they board pax on window seats then center seats and on final call aisle seats no matter if you are in row 10 or 24. Uncomfortable at the gates. AM is the best airline there is in Mexico.
252,Bangkok - Moscow - Bangkok. Flights arrived and left reasonably on time. Service was satisfactory and cabin staff seemed quite friendly. They spoke only Russian with me but I heard adequate English to the non speaking Russian behind me. Food and wine was OK and the entertainment adequate. The return overnight flight had a flat bed and I had sufficient rest to be able to rent a car on arrival in Bangkok the following morning. Aeroflot continue to provide a reasonably priced direct service to Moscow from Bangkok which is why I use them.
253,Moscow-Bangkok-Moscow. Departure from old and dark Terminal F in Moscow. Boarding started about 50 people went to the jetty when they stopped everything due to broken galley on board. We were strangled inside the jetway for over 30 mins with no info at all. Couldn't get on board and they closed gate doors so we couldn't comeback to the gate. Horrible service. Flight itself was ok nice 777 but 10 seats abreast is too much on such a long flight - too cramped and not comfortable. Crew were very young tried to smile few times and be nice. IFE was good. Food acceptable but very small portions. No alcohol was served at all. Return flight without any boarding problems. Food much better than from Moscow but no choices were given at all. Young crew didn't smile even once quite poor English female FAs looked very nice and groomed but male FAs looked like some cheap bar workers - all ties untied buttons of shirts were left opened really bad view. Not impressed at all. Generally I wouldn't recommend Aeroflot for longhaul flights as service is quite poor crew inattentive and very cramped cabin but they offer the quickest connection from Western Europe and day flights which saves a lot of time.
254,ATH-NTE 11 August 2012. Flight was on time the meal was served after one hour as we experienced turbulence and flight attendants weren't allowed to serve us. The meal was a sandwich and endless drinks. Crew friendly and smiling. NTE-ATH 18 August 2012: Flight on time. Boarded fast it was 100% complete like the last flight. Flight attendants served the meal immediately so people could sleep (the flight was late in the night). The meal was a sandwich again. Arrived on time. Nice experience will travel again this summer.
255,Last August from Athens to Prague and back. The airplane was an Airbus A320. Clean and comfortable. The staff were very friendly. Flight took off on time and arrived in Prague on time. The meal was poor but the trip was short. The first part of my trip the aircraft was full from Prague to Athens after 5 days only 60% full. I paid only 125 euros for the ticket!
256,Athens-Milan MXP. Airbus A320. Flight on time. Very pleasant trip. Cabin staff as always friendly and helpful. Nice meal.
257,We recently traveled on 3 domestic flights within Argentina - Buenos Aires - Iguazu - Salta - Buenos Aires. We had no problems with any of the flights. They departed on time and our luggage arrived safely. Check in was super fast. The planes were reasonably modern and staff service OK. Food consisted of a snack box which was adequate for a short haul flight. While the flights were expensive prices were reduced considerably by purchasing discounted tickets before we arrived in Argentina. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the flights or perhaps we were just lucky. There was certainly nothing wrong with them.
258,Buenos Aires to Trelew and back. Overall very good service for the value. Smiling and helpful cabin attendants and good snack box provided on such a short flight. No inflight entertainment only magazines (this point should be improved). Fast and efficient baggage delivery. I would certainly recommend this airline.
259,We flew to Johannesburg from London Gatwick via Tripoli to attend the World Cup. All flights near enough on time and a smooth transit through Tripoli. Tripoli airport is not too bad although I wouldn't like to spend more than a few hours there. The entertainment was good food as good as expected the were polite (but spoke little English) and the seats comfortable with sufficient leg room. I did get the impression that the staff were probably a little too laid back at times. Overall the value for money was excellent the customer service was good and the planes were modern (although they did need cleaning up a bit.)
260,London Gatwick - Tripoli - Accra return. Tripoli to Accra was delayed a little as only one scanner was working so when they started boarding about half the passengers were still on the wrong side of the security check. The other flights were on time. Food good seats comfy checked luggage was where it should be price was excellent. Having read previous comments here I had to see how bad the loos at Tripoli airport could be and was disappointed : clean and even soap in the dispenser!
261,I had two flights with them in business class MEX-MAD and LHR-MEX. The Madrid flight was in a 777 and the London - Mexico flight was in a new 787. Completely different experience. They have substantially improved their food offering but now the crews have an excellent attitude in the way they treat the clients. The seat in the 777 is outdated as is the entertainment system but the 787 flat bed seat is a great quality seat. I can never sleep on planes and when I went up to the galley for a snack I found the cabin crew to be very friendly.
262,Due to past experiences I was weary to pick AM on this YUL-MEX-YUL flight nevertheless this time they surprised me and exceeded my expectations on both sectors. Both flights were on the newer 737-800s. I was upgraded on the outbound flight. Seats were the standard for medium haul although getting off the seat to walk can be cumbersome for those on the window seats. Meals were OK. Purser was courteous but distant. Inbound flight is a redeye. Service and meals were really good seats new and comfortable the one problem is that Montreal flights have a dedicated check in area and there were only two staff members working the flight so it took a while to check in. New 737s are really modern with PTVs and sky interiors. I don't know if this experience is enough to say that they have really improved.
263,Flew from AGP-DUB on EI585 (A333) paid a bit extra to sit in Business class not sure how comfortable I'd be lying 'down' at that angle for a long period of time or if it's worth it. The entertainment screen can be pretty difficult to see if the shade is left up. EI should maybe roll out a business 'lite' for this route and throw free something or other into the mix but really it's quite a short flight so not hugely important but might be a nice touch. Bought a breakfast quite nice and filling. Crew the usual brand of EI pleasant. Usual happened on landing and has happened the last few times it's almost like someone has a peek out of a window and wonders what a plane is doing there as if it's a surprise. Waited an age to get on stand even though multiple were empty equally as long for a land bridge and then another 20 mins for luggage. Fine in the air but the ground needs work. Recommend all the same just don't be in a rush after landing.
264,I flew business class to Ireland for my vacation and I can say it was the best flight. It was all I thought it would be on Aer Lingus. The business class seating and all you get is worth the value in all areas. The service from the crew was great always seeing if you needed something if you were doing ok and keeping you updated.
265,Travelled LGW-YYZ business class. My first trip with Aer Lingus long haul and I was not sure what to expect. The experience was just perfect. Business cabin has only 12 seats plenty of room for storage. I had no neighbour making feel well isolated for a quiet flight. Sleeping was comfortable although the not fully flat bed is a bit tricky to handle at first. Food was one of the best I had on the many airlines I've flown with. Finally staff were very careful smiling and professional. I would definitively fly again with them. The only point to improve would be a better dedicated business check-in at LGW.
266,I flew from Vienna to Hong Kong via Moscow and back. A few suggestions for improvement: the airline could work on the friendliness and on the language skills of its stuff. The inflight entertainment for the long distance flight was perfect but very poor for the short ones. Food and drinks was very good!
267,My wife and I flew from PEK-LHR with a tight 50 minute connection at SVO. Having to connect at SVO was the only downside to an otherwise comfortable and pleasant trip. Anyone who knows SVO terminal knows that it is overburdened chaotic and in dire need of an overhaul. We made our connecting flight (no thanks to the indifferent Aeroflot ground personnel) only because the aircraft was late arriving in Moscow. That said we still had to run through the terminal. Flights on SU were surprisingly good with comfortable seating choice of well catered meals and cabin attendants who were very professional and friendly. This airline has really upped their game on long haul international flights. In fact I dare say there are equal to if not better than many of their European competitors. And price wise they are way ahead of the game. It's a shame they use SVO as their hub however.
268,HKG-SVO-MAD and return from BCN. Flight crews on all 4 sectors were very professional and made every effort to make the flights as smooth as possible. Food very impressive both in terms of quality and quantity. Seats and Inflight Entertainment were not among the best but still met the average standards you would expect for long-haul flights. The real drawback for Aeroflot is the transfer at SVO in addition to all those comments already made we encountered extra problems as we only had about an hour transfer time on our return journey. A staff member called all passengers to HKG at passport control we were guided through Terminal D and E to the boarding gate at F - all by running there were no trolleys so we had to take all carry on luggage by hand - that's 20 minutes running. Our checked in baggage was left behind only arrived the next day according to Aeroflot's ground agent at HKG this is a daily recurring problem to this flight.
269,SKG-ATH-FCO return. A320 and A321. All flights about 70% full. Clean cabin friendly and nice crew comfortable seats. Food ok just a sandwich and free drinks. Smooth flights and arrivals ahead of schedule.
270,Sydney to Buenos Aires return. Plane out very old and needing internal maintenance. A couple of overhead locker taped up with do not use notices. The TV that I could see did not work. Didn't see the cabin staff smile once. Seats are tired and sagged. Food was good though I had taken bits to eat but the meal we got was good. No in flight services after the meal but drinks and snacks available. On the way back we were at the airport 23 hours before the flight (due to our connection) and requested a row of seats together. Couldn't check us in as check-in opened 3 hours before. When we checked in 3 hours before we were sat in different seats over the plane and told there were no available seats! Managed to get the children sat together and myself and my wife were in separate seats. On return the plane was in a slightly better shape a little newer. The TV was working but lost the red so some interesting colours for the films. Reasonable films and one channel in English. Food was again good. The cabin staff were great. All smiles and they came round every couple of hours with water/juice. Value for money was excellent.
271,Flight between Sydney and Buenos Aires was pretty good. Staff were friendly and spoke English! Once I arrived in Buenos Aires this changed. Next flight was to Sao Paulo but they refer to it as San Pablo. This flight was delayed a couple of hours but the staff were pretty good. Once I arrived at Sao Paulo the service was not as good but still okay. Staff seem tired and run down. Staff at the gate could not decide which gate the airline was at. If your a person of English speaking background and don't know much Spanish or Portuguese it pays to find someone to translate. I flew to Curitiba and the service was excellent and staff were friendly! We arrived on time. On the way back my flight got delayed and was going to be diverted from Buenos Aires due to poor weather. A nice stewardess kept me informed of this. Staff were very professional with the delay too. Overall a great experience.
272,London -Johannesburg via Tripoli return. I took the precaution of travelling hand luggage only and making sure not to use the bathrooms during the stop over at Tripoli and was pleasantly surprised. The service matched any I've travelled with over the years and at half the price. Considering they offer the option of twice as much luggage in the hold as any other airline I've travelled with I might even travel with lots of luggage next time!
273,CDG-TIP-OUA out ABJ-TIP-CDG return. Excellent flight to TIP clean new A330 with good food and friendly staff. Flight to OUA similarly well presented. Unfortunately the flight from ABJ-TIP was operated by Nouvelair on Afriqiyah's behalf other passengers also noticed the difference with grumpy staff and terrible food. Happy to return to CDG with Afriqiyah again and more good service.
274,"London Gatwick-Tripoli-Johannesburg return. I booked on price so my expectations were fairly low. The first three sectors were more or less on time fourth just under 30 minutes late. I was pleasantly surprised to find LGW check-in desk open nearly 4 hours before the scheduled departure time! Airline food is rarely very good in economy but Afriqiyah's compared quite favourably with most. My only criticism is that a couple of dishes were quite spicy - and a choice was not always offered. I was pleasantly surprised by the in-flight entertainment which had a modern touch-screen interface and seemed to be reliable. Legroom was good. For me the only negative issue really was Tripoli Airport. The departure lounge is small and not very comfortable. There were people smoking despite ""no smoking"" signs. Maybe smoking is only allowed in certain areas but the smoke carries everywhere. The toilets are in serious need of modernisation too. I was glad I didn't have to spend long there. The staff there were pleasant and helpful though. I would consider flying with Afriqiyah again if the price is right especially once the expansion and upgrading of Tripoli Airport is complete."
275,Was extremely pleased with the level of friendly professional service we received on two flight segments from Cincinnati OH to Cancun Mexico a few weeks ago. The stewardesses on every one of the four flights were so helpful and willing to please that I was taken back due to the fact that of late stewardesses in general have carried an air of arrogant indifference. The planes were very clean. The schedule was adhered to.
276,During the 3hrs and 20min flight from Mexico City to Tijuana Aeromexico created a very pleasant experience reminiscent of the golden age of flight. The crew was young and attentive professional and bilingual. The aircraft was a wonderfully well kept 737-800 with a state of the art entertainment system. Complementary snacks and drinks including alcohol were served twice during the journey. Landing was on time and arrival at the gate was relatively quick. I would definitely fly with them again.
277,I was pretty excited to once again fly the Dreamliner especially on the direct NRT-MEX in Biz. The cabin itself is nothing out of the ordinary for business class. It is a 2-2-2 configuration typical on 787s. Enough room to stretch out and sleep if needed. What disappointed me though was the service. You would expect for paying what I paid for that seat they would have been more attentive. The only times the flight attendants came around to attend to us was when serving dinner serving breakfast and once to bring us a bottle of water. Other than that they stayed in their areas chatting the entire flight. I was traveling with a family member and we stood up to stretch and order a beer. Well after they had served us each two they said they were out of beers. Really? Overall the only thing this flight had going for it is that it is the Dreamliner and it is direct from NRT to MEX. if you don't mind a stopover I recommend flying to SAN on JAL's Dreamliner and transferring there or maybe to LAX on SQ's 380 and transferring there. Aeromexico needs to step up its service game if it hopes to compete with the Asian carriers.
278,Boston to Shannon March 9 (E10134). Shannon to Boston on March 18 2014 (E10135). I have been flying with Aer Lingus since I was a child and am never disappointed with the food service and hospitality offered. The planes are well kept and clean. The crew were so attentive - they define Irish hospitality.
279,Flew with Aer Lingus to Boston on flight EI 139. Economy. Flew on the A330 to and from. Excellent plane. The cabin crew were very helpful and friendly. The meal on the plane going over was excellent it was off their new sky menu. I got the steak it was lovely. It was first class dining in economy class. It was well worth the ??7.50 because that included a glass of wine. I would recommend getting this. Unfortunately I couldn't get this meal on the way back sold out. However the meal we got was still lovely. Overall would like to fly with Aer Lingus in the future again. Would recommend them.
280,Travelled on the Aer Lingus Regional ATR DUB-BRS-DUB return on Sat morning 7th May. Excellent service overall. Flights departed on time arrived early. The return was on one of the new aircraft. The Aer Lingus lounge in T2 is excellent and well worth the short detour. Only point to note is that all the Regional flights take off from the one gate in Dublin T2. You proceed downstairs onto the same level as US pre clearance through gate 412. I almost missed the bus over to the morning flight only for the fact that a ground staff called out 'anyone else for Bristol'. The screen at the gate advised next flight was the BRS flight and the Glasgow was boarding first. So perhaps they need to look at that or advise that there is a short bus ride over to the aircraft. Otherwise well recommended Vs the competition and the fare was excellent value for a short flight.
281,SU-273 Bangkok to Moscow 22nd January then we transferred to a flight to Stockholm. I must say I was surprised over the quality. We bought two ticket going from BKK to Arlanda round-trip Aeroflot was about 750$ cheaper than the rest. At the airport we got upgraded to premium economy for free. Good food good service and some of the air stewardesses even smiled. Others were not so happy but they where attentive. Of course my upgrade affects my review the only complaint I might have is that the check in was to slow but what do you expect when the plane is full and many get upgraded.
282,LCA-ATH-MUC. Flight on-time and very pleasant . Cabin crew polite and helpful. Hot breakfast served before we reach Athens and normal meal at the Munich flight. The price a little bit expensive but I would recommend it! As always satisfactory.
283,I flew SKG-STR-SKG. I enjoyed the flight. The seat was comfortable and there was plenty of legroom. In addition flight departed on-time. The crew always had a smile however the in-flight entertainment was poor.
284,SYD-EZE-GIG-IGR-EZE-SYD Plus AEP-FTE-AEP. What a great airline for the price. We flew Club Condor class ex SYD. Before buying the ticket I researched the airline so I would know what to expect. It exceeded my expectations. Got the above ticket for AUD 3700.00 The only sectors in economy were AEP-FTE-AEP. Of the 7 flights all left on time except one and that only was delayed 20 mins. Food was great service was great. If you wanted anything they were more than obliging to help. Will definitely fly AR again.
285,I flew to Johannesburg via Brussels and Tripoli return. Flight attendants great who provided a cheerful and competent service. One even went to the business class to get me a lovely cup of coffee when he realised coffee was crucial to my travelling pleasure! Yes there were delays in Tripoli - but immigration officials were welcoming and we were kept fully informed as to the reasons for hold up. Toilets in Tripoli are as bad as everyone else suggests - do avoid. Useful to know that they accept Euros in their Duty Free and cafe.
286,I have used Afriqiyah Airways for four return trips Gatwick - Accra over the last 14 months. Treatment has been unfailingly good. Yes there have been delays but informed of the reasons for the delays and on one occasion we were given drinks while we waited to go into the airport. The cabin crew are excellent and value for money is good.
287,London-Tripoli-Johannesburg. Tripoli airport toilets are so bad you really have to be desperate to use them. Airline good value for money. Cabin crew not very cheerful looked tired all times. The only reason I would fly with them again is value for money but more friendly and cheerful cabin crew needed. A330 plane has good leg room and clean but the A320 plane not much leg room and needs cleaning up.
288,Tripoli - London Gatwick - Tripoli. New plan good entertainment attentive service. No problems apart from painfully slow Check-In at Gatwick and no alcohol.
289,Flew LAX to MEX (AM649) on a 737-800. Paid $30 extra for AM Plus seats on row #7. Boarding at LAX was a bit of a mess because AeroMexico boards every window seat first then every middle seat aisle seat etc. Airplane was clean and my AM Plus seat had a few more inches of extra leg room. Take-off was smooth and the flight was good. A few hours into the flight breakfast and coffee were served. I did not partake because I was asleep (a special thank you to the flight attendant for not waking me up). Flight attendants were courteous respectful and polite. We arrived in MEX about 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Several days later I flew MEX to LAX (AM648) on a brand new 737-800. Once again sat on AM Plus row #7. Beautiful brand new leather seats with a personal TV screens. Every AM Plus seat was tastefully decorated with pillows blankets and headphones. A croissant sandwich peanuts chocolate pudding and drinks were served. Flight was smooth and arrived on time at LAX. Very nice flight attendants. Will fly again.
290,AM633 on 21 August SAT-MEX and AM632 on August 25 MEX-SAT. Short trip from SAT to MEX and return on Embraer jet. First time on AM and it was a terrific experience crew were efficient aircraft clean and very well maintained. Snack service was tasty with fresh choices and excellent bar service. I will gladly take AM again as my travel plans permit.
291,We fly Aeromexico JFK to Cancun. We use them whenever we can. The reasons are many but here are some. The crew are very accommodating and always courteous. We enjoy having food to eat. If there is an empty seat after takeoff we were allowed to move. The plane was new.
292,Dublin to Cardiff return. I have used the Friday evening and return on Sunday night frequently over the last two years. They have recently had more new planes (ATR 72) prior to this the flights were invariably a few hours late. However they are now mostly less than one hour late. Service from the crew is good for a one hour flight. Parking at a remote stand in Dublin then having a bus transfer plus a lengthy walk to Arrivals. Would be good if Ryanair returned to this route.
293,Flew from Bristol to Dublin for the Giro D'Italia using Aer Lingus Regional (Aer Arran). Boarding on the outward and return was calm and civilised and the ATR aircraft clean and comfy enough for a short hop. Check-in staff and the crew onboard were polite and there was an adequate range of snacks and drinks for purchase onboard. Terminal 2 at Dublin was smart and stylish. The only drawback was the long lines for check in and bag drop on the return flight but there were a large number of people travelling that day - many returning after the Giro.
294,Flew JFK-SVO-BEY-SVO-JFK. The price of ticket was 200$-300$ cheaper than the price of a ticket with other airlines. All flights were ok. If not on time either late by a couple of minutes or early by a couple of minutes. IFE great. Staff OK. One of the things I didn't like is the food. It is edible but it is always beef or chicken with a salad or cheese with ham (on all flights) the meals are not diversified. I didn't like the seats. I'm 190cm so it was really uncomfortable for me to sit in this seat for a flight of 9-10hrs but it shouldn't be the same problem for someone shorter. Airport is good. Staff is friendly. Terminal D and E are new and spacious but terminal F is over crowded and there is a lot of stores and not a lot of places to sit. Overall the experience was good. Will take them again and recommend them to someone if price is good.
295,SVO-JFK return in business. Generally nice experience. Smooth priority boarding at SVO excellent champagne and starters though the main course looked a bit cheap. Attentive staff. I noticed that the flight attendants on both flights tended to smile more and respond more quickly to those who smiled in return. The seats are not lie-flat unfortunately but still softer and more comfortable than the recliners installed by LH on their A380s. The screen is large enough with good colors but the content lacks recent action movies.
296,Paris Orly to Lisbon new airline for me seat and leg room average but if your traveling with baggage the 20kg baggage allowances included in the fare makes Aigle Azur worth considering. Cabin crew did a quick run through the cabin with a (paid) drinks cart then duty free cart and promptly disappeared behind the curtain for the rest of the flight. The airline appears to be unsure of its identity although they provide a baggage allowance they are not a full service airline as this flight was over a meal time (dinner) no food or snack service provided but not a LOCO as no food was available for purchase either so we went hungry!
297,ATH-PRAGUE-ATH. A320. Efficient and polite cabin crew smooth service although economy cabin was full. The cold snack (sandwich and tiny chocolate) was rather of poor quality/taste. Cold and hot drinks were offered with a smile. My score would be a 10 if the cold meal was a bit more inspiring!
298,Aegean is usually my choice when the price is reasonable very trustworthy. Aircraft are clean and meals tasteful. Almost always on time. Friendly staff friendly excess baggage policy.
299,MXP-ATH Jul 15th. A321 aircraft new and comfortable and large legroom. We had a hot meal something that I've seen just on LR flights. Flight on time and efficient crew. ATH-HER Jul 17th. A320 aircraft. Very short domestic flight but more stressful than the previous one. The plane was very crowded and the boarding chaotic. As the flight was just 30 mins long we were served in a rush remarkable that the crew managed to serve 150 people is a short time. In general I'd fly them again.
300,Australia to Brazil. I had no problems at all during the flight. No delays service wasn't that bad and staff were friendly. I wasn't able to eat the food served because my agent (nothing to do with AA) forgot to send the request for vegetarian food (must be done when the booking is made) and they didn't have much options for non- meat eaters. There's no entertainment at all. You pay what you get for the price I paid I am satisfied.
301,Been flying AM 429 Monday morning flight for about 3 months now and returning on Thursdays flight 422. Very friendly and professional service airplanes are modern and with more leg room than most.
302,I myself am a frequent flyer. I live in Paris but my family lives in Cork. Aer Lingus is the only airline to offer a direct link to Cork from Paris. The staff always have a smile when you travel. Food is nice their is no In flight entertainment screens but its OK for a 1 hr 40min flight.
303,I have travelled with various airlines out of Dublin in the past haven taken a break from Aer Lingus. However recently I flew with them to Munich and have to say I was very impressed overall with the service. I checked in on my mobile presented my boarding card on my mobile and had no problems using it getting through security. The aircraft was an A320 I was seated at row 12a which was an emergency exit so I had plenty of leg room on way out. Food was of good quality although I would have liked even a complimentary tea or coffee instead of 2.50 but only a small negative. On my return home the journey was a little more eventful which ended with me collapsing in the middle of the cabin. I can not commend the cabin crew enough for looking after me and administering the necessary first aid etc to ensure I was safe and comfortable. The crew were professional calm and reassuring which now looking back on it is what some other airlines are missing. I will definitely be a convert back to Aer Lingus.
304,Staff at airport and staff on plane all very professional great seats comfortable plenty of leg room and food lovely. I travelled with my 3 grandchildren from Dublin - Madrid return and found it a very enjoyable experience. Staff were lovely had great patience with customers. Only downside was Dublin airport had no facilities for children only the play area at Burger King which my children were too big for.
305,Moscow-Shanghai with brand new A330-300 at the end of December. Not very punctual - departed and arrived 20 minutes late. Terminal F at SVO is crowded and inconvenient. Cabin crew friendly and efficient. Food was served twice good choice tasty meals. Entertainment system is very good. Blankets and earphones were given to all the passengers. Seat comfort was very poor to me. Seats are narrow with surprisingly little legroom. When you recline your seat the bottom part goes forward it makes the legroom smaller. Not the best experience ever but I would fly them again if the price is fair.
306,Flew SVO-ICN (codeshare with Korean). Not much to rave or complain about - flight departed and landed on time decent seats good IFE. If only they turn on the IFE before departure and leave it on after final descent (during departure/landing the IFE reset to front camera - not much to see during night). Meals edible vegetarian meal option honoured. Will fly them again if price is good.
307,9th December from Krasnodar to Moscow Sheremetyevo on Flight SU 1103 and missed the connection to Flight SU 263 to London Heathrow. I flew yesterday on Aeroflot and experienced delays and missed connection through no fault of Aeroflot. I was dealt with by their many ground staff at Sheremetyevo extremely well the plane was modern and well flown and I would strongly recommend them for the service I received. Full marks and strongly recommended.
308,Porto to Paris Orly on ZI 312 (A320) on 28 March 2014. First time on this airline and I'm a little bit unimpressed with check-in at Porto Airport. No effort to direct passengers to correct boarding desks hence I ended up in the web-check in/bag-drop queue with passengers who had not even checked in online. Thankfully queue was processed within 20 minutes and got to the gate with plenty of time to spare. My seat was next to the emergency exit so I had plenty of legroom. Seat itself was comfy and perfect for a nap. Crew extremely professional and always had a smile on their faces. Flight took off on time and landed smoothly in Paris-Orly 20 minutes ahead of scheduled arrival time. Once on the ground we were told by the cabin crew that the captain of this Aigle Azur flight had piloted his last flight so we promptly congratulated him as we departed the aircraft. All in all Aigle Azur was worth the money that I paid . Not sure if I'll have another chance to travel on them again but if they have routes that I want to fly I'll keep them in mind.
309,BSL-ALG-BSL on A320 both legs. First time flown ZI and overall was an impressive experience. The cabin was quite clean and the seat was quite comfortable with good pitch. Warm and delicious meal for 2 hrs flight was a very good service. Another positive was the 30 kg free baggage for all economy class passenger.
310,Our family of 4 had two flights: Sep 15 from Rome to Athens Sep 18 from Athens to Prague. Both flights were satisfactory. Each one left on time. Candies were offered before take off. Snacks consisted of sandwich and yoghurt; this was for the morning flight to Prague. The evening flight from Rome also offered a sandwich and juice. Good coffee was available. The economy seats were comfortable for my Asian size. But the seat seems to be of standard size whether on an Asian American or European airline. The A320 cabins were clean. Cabin service was friendly and efficient. Check in at Fiumicino and Venizelos airports were fast and straight forward. The only inconvenience we experienced was at Athens airport. It was a late night arrival past 11pm but there was still the hassle of getting off the plane and riding a bus to the terminal. I thought all Aegean jets were not using the tube seeing several of their planes parked in the tarmac at some distance from the terminal. That wasn't the case with the morning flight to Prague as the plane was connected to a tube. Overall value for money is satisfactory. We'd choose Aegean again if an opportunity arises in the future.
311,Took Aegean for the short hop from Athens to Mykonos. The day we travelled there was a public sector strike which was no fault of the airline. However although they updated their website the day before with a list of delayed and cancelled flights ours did not appear in the list which led me to believe it would run to time. When we checked in they informed me it would run 4 hours late but still allowed us to check in our suitcases. They offered no vouchers or refreshments (which I would have thought for a delay of this length they would have to but maybe strike situations are exempt). We eventually took off 20 minutes later than the new expected departure time. The air crew were so busy talking in loud voices at the front of the cabin we couldn't hear the safety demonstration. It also meant that they did not notice the guy behind us ignoring the instruction to switch off mobile devices as he continued with his. They did however manage to hand out boiled sweets and whizz round with a drinks run which is as much as you could expect on such a short flight. The tickets were expensive considering we booked them 9 months in advance and it was a 25 minute flight.
312,Athens-Mykonos-Athens. All flights on time very nice looking Airbus 320; good leather seats overhead TV screens and nice cabin crew. They even tried to do some service on those 25 mins flights (sweets and drinks) but on both legs they managed to reach first 6 or 7 rows which is ridiculous in general - nobody expects any service on such a short hop so why bother?
313,Sydney to Buenos Aires and return in April 2013 in business class. Yes it's an old aircraft and the seats are only the old lounge chair type. Also the entertainment is limited. But they are replacing the A340-200 with a 300 series later this year so that should solve these problems. The business class check in was performed meticulously and lounge access given at both airports. Priority boarding was strictly enforced. The on board service was friendly and very personal. My coat snatched away and hung up as soon as I arrived at my seat. The catering was adequate and appropriate for such a long flight. Main courses were presented and served from a trolley in the cabin. They did offer fast track on departure but not on arrival. Still the airport in Sydney was so quiet it was unnecessary. One small criticism is that the Sydney arrival cards were in Spanish. Not easy for us Aussies. The price paid for the ticket represented unbelievable value. I'd fly the again without hesitation.
314,My husband and I flew to Mexico City and then to Manzanillo. Staff were friendly and helpful. We encountered no problems with this airline. Our flights ran on schedule and our luggage was not lost. On the return trip I was missing a form at the time of boarding staff quickly helped me fill it out and held the plane for me to run back to the boarding gate. We will use this airline again. We feel like we received good service for the price of our ticket.
315,My children used the unaccompanied minors service from ORD-MEX-VER. I was very nervous as were they. They had never flown before plus being alone they were scared. None the less they had a great flights. Their layover in Mexico City was fun they said. They were taken to a game room that was a restricted area for unaccompanied minors only where they were supervised and played video games and watched movies. My children said everyone they encountered with AeroMexico were helpful and friendly. No problems at all with delays baggage etc... I will use this airline again. My children will be flying annually to Mexico to visit their father.
316,Paris to Mexico City. The staff at the airport in both airports (Mexico / Paris) were friendly and helpful. The plane is a new B787 Dreamliner with pretty modern installation. The food was served very good and the entertainment was for a long 12h flight very amused. I will prefer Aeromexico for future flights from Europe to Mexico or to Central / South America.
317,Flew the DUB-ORD route. I was disappointed with the movie selection offered by the in-flight entertainment. Compared to Delta there were far fewer movies to choose from and they were not current titles. Expect ones you've already seen 5 years ago. The hot meal was the usual chicken or beef options and was nothing to write home about. The pre-landing snack was a flapjack. They give you a knife and fork to eat it bizarrely. I guess this airline just loves wasting money. The armrests between seats do not go all the way up to prevent passengers lying down on a row of four. Annoying if you want to catch a quick nap. Overall I was disappointed with the flight given how much Aer Lingus charge for a one-way. I'll try another airline for the return journey.
318,Volgograd-Moscow Sheremetyevo-Sochi Adler in business class Sochi Adler-Moscow Sheremetyevo in economy class. Excellent experience first time with Aeroflot. All flights on time and baggage checked and delivered promptly with priority tags on business was the first to be delivered. Crew friendly and very professional seat comfort excellent leather seating in Business class with plenty of high-quality food and wines. On business service rivals some airline first classes even on Russian domestic short sectors printed menus and wine list lots of reading material (counted 5 different Aeroflot publications on a 1:45 min flight) and crews very attentive and caring. All of them spoke good English. IL-96 aircraft very roomy and spacious should be a nice experience on longer flights. Would fly Aeroflot again without hesitation.
319,"Flight from HKG-SVO-DUS-SVO-HKG. From HKG SU213 with new Boeing 777. Comfortable seat food ok. Served wine Staff friendly. Flight on time. Flight SU2436 to DUS delayed 40 minutes with no information. Boarding and check-in in DUS for flight SU 2537 and SU 212 very poor. I'm a Skyteam priority passenger from China Southern Airlines Aeroflot don't accepted the ""elite plus"" card same. No invitation to the lounge I had 1 kg excess baggage - not accepted. No requested seat for all flights. Aeroflot is am Skyteam member but does not follow the Skyteam rules. In Moscow Airport access to the Lounge but no priority Boarding. Seat in A330 a little small. Entertainment ok. Flight on time. The ticket fee was steep but service and own rules should be improved. I will not use this airline in the future."
320,Have flown Aegean several times to Chania via Athens. Returned on Friday 24th August. We had booked a flight from Chania to Athens due to depart at 11.20. We eventually took off at 12.10 no explanation given. We were really worried as our connecting Aegean flight from Athens to Heathrow was leaving at 13.30! We landed in Athens at 13.15 and still did not know whether we would catch our flight as the stewardess said we could ask once we landed it did not lend itself to a smooth flight experience. However what happened next deserves a gold star: an Aegean representative met us as we came off the plane and escorted us very quickly and smoothly through several checks and security onto our London flight which took off as soon as we were on board at 1335. Amazing! And what is even more amazing is that our luggage was also found and secured onto our flight. Excellent recovery by Aegean.
321,Return trip to ATH using Aegean for the first time. Would book again. Check in at LHR ok but more efficient in ATH (which is a great airport by the way). Helped that the main carrier in ATH so they have the resource to get people checked in. In flight service good - nice crew on both legs with lots of smiling and team spirit. Food ok but then we all have low expectations. Overall very good experience and would definitely chose over BA on this route.
322,MEX-PVR-MEX-CUN on EMB190 B737-700 and B737-800. EMB190 and B737-800 were new and great B737-700 was old but well kept. First row on economy is great with plenty of leg room. All flights were on time and service was good. They offer only refreshments and alcoholic drinks. Attendants were nice and speak English perfectly. Terminal 2 at MEX is modern and great. Luggage drop and security was very fast. On B737-700 and -800 there was full IFE service with more than 10 movies.
323,LIM-MEX-LIM Business Class (Clase Premiere) in April was a perfect example on how Aeromexico has come to represent an inconsistent product. Plane is an oldish 737 without personal IFE but it was just fine in both legs. Seat Ok and amenity kit that Aeromexico now handles only on overnight flight with some space for improvement even though it was delivered with a really nice IPAD case. As far as service is concerned a huge difference between the MEX-LIM and the LIM-MEX leg. On the first leg it was outstanding with a professional warm and polite flight attendant. Good food and good selection of drinks. On the way back flights attendants did not even bother to greet passengers and performed their job mechanically and without interest. What a difference! What a lack of consistency in the product delivered by Aeromexico. A 3/10 would be a perfect grade to describe this last experience.
324,JFK-MEX-ZIH and return. JFK-MEX on the red eye was completed on an older model 737 with no inflight entertainment (presumably due to the timing of the flight - depart 12.15am arrive 4.40am) but we were served a very nice hot sandwich shortly after takeoff. MEX-JFK return on a brand-new 737 - great plane excellent inflight entertainment and again a nice hot meal. The ZIH-MEX connection was slightly delayed but we were assured that a significant amount of passengers on the flight were connecting to the JFK flight. Sure enough about 18 of us were greeted by an agent upon deplaning in MEX and were escorted as a group to the JFK gate which was in the process of boarding. Excellent service throughout by both ground and cabin crews. Would not hesitate to recommend Aeromexico in the future.
325,SEN-DUB-SEN: Again very impressed with Aer Lingus Regional their new ATR aircraft are even better than before. Crew very attentive and flight on time both ways. Would definitely use them again instead of Ryanair from Stansted. Only gripe was hand luggage allowance. We were really restricted on what we could take onboard and had to end up purchasing another checked in bag so it was annoying when you see passengers with bags that well exceed the dimensions on their website carrying them on board.
326,"Dublin-Malaga 7th April EI 584/585. Booked flex fare as it includes lounge access bags etc on this particular flight. Aer Lingus use the the Airbus 330 so you can reserve the seats normally used in Premier Class (economy service). All good nice crew as per previous comments the IFE is a bit of a joke even in the premier seats the remote control doesn't sync with the screen and the touch screen has to be ""thumped"" to get any reaction. Choice of movies and TV was poor but I didn't take the flight to view movies used my iPad. Onboard wifi available at 11.95 euros per hour return flight same good crew but I felt a little stretched as they now operate with minimum crew numbers of 8 on board as against 11 when I last flew this route. One comment I do have to make ..there has been huge media coverage on Aer Lingus launching their new ""Bia"" inflight menu by celebrity chef Clodagh McKenna someone should point out not everyone in Ireland is as addicted to cheese Ms McKenna appears to be! Every single sandwich and snack has one type of cheese or another added even on the pre-order meals it's a choice of cheese or more cheese. I'm a great believer in not trying to fix something that wasn't broken. Your old pre-order menu and onboard menu was edible! Take a tip from other airlines purchase on board menus. All in all Aer Lingus are good."
327,ARN-SVO-BKK return on A320/A333/B773/A319. Nice new planes and all on schedule. Food varied between fair and bad. No alcohol available due to past troublesome experiences with drunk passengers. Few smiles from staff but service good. IFE very good on B773. If food a bit better and wine available I would have rated a 4 star experience.
328,AMS-SVO with KLM and SVO-BKK on A330 flight number AFL270. The airplanes are good however the transit service is really poor this might be because of the airport it is hard to figure out your flight gate and it is complicated to get information from the staff. Waiting hours are awful I expected to get some sort of cabin or something upon arrival but sleeping on the floor buying your own drinks is about it. I won't fly a non direct flight with Aeroflot anymore it's not worth the money you save.
329,ODS-SVO-IAD Economy. Great value if you want a good price good food and don't mind not having the latest IFE or can read Russian newspapers. Security can be slow transferring at Sheremetyevo but then again international transfers at USA airports are slow too. Plane for about a 2 hour time to make transfers when in terminal D. Staff on the legs I was on were friendly and helpful. It helps a lot to speak Russian or at least some Russian words.
330,Belfast-Rhodes-Belfast. Clean Airbus A320. Both flights on time friendly staff but the 'meal' they served consisted of a dry bread roll with one small thin slice of ham which was dry. You were not allowed any drinks after the first round with your meal unless it was water.
331,As always excellent service professional attitude for both the ground staff in Brussels as well as the people on board on the BRU-CFU flight on 17 August 2012. I am a frequent flyer with more than 30-35 flights per year. Aegean is the top of my preferences for both my professional trips as well as my vacation. This time I flew with my dog and staff on the ground have been extremely helpful in making my trip troubles free. The service on board is much better from the competition in the Belgium-Greece route. There is a good meal as well as free drinks throughout the flight. The airbus was clean and nicely decorated with enough leg space. In a few words: Aegean was an excellent choice.
332,I'm a frequent business class customer although on domestic flights this 'business class' turns into 'club economy'. It is hard to understand that the most expensive seats carry the name 'economy' attached to them. The catering service is very poor excluding alcoholic drinks and real food which is replaced by sandwiches served in a a very 'low cost' style box.
333,Sydney to Buenos Aires. Was travelling on the great unknown with this airline so I kept my expectation's low. Plane full with lots of legroom for 18 year old plane. Food was ok with snacks and drinks which you had to get yourself. Great views of the Antarctica if only the staff would let us see most of the flight the shades were kept down. Bring your own entertainment but they did show a couple of movies. For $1200 round-trip plus 2 internal flights I really can't complain.
334,After a six month assignment in Argentina flying almost only Aerolineas Argentinas and Austral I was pleasantly surprised with the experience. Almost 30 domestic flights and no cancellations only one significant delay (3 hours) due to airport strike. Service good to excellent free snack (5-8 dollar value to US domestic standards) beverages offered once or twice (even on flights under an hour) Flight attendants friendly and efficient. I am impressed it is now better than any domestic option in the US.
335,LIM-MEX-ORD economy round-trip. My only complaints are: 1) They forgot my vegetarian meal on LIM-MEX leg. The flight attendant brushed me off and just left without even asking if I wanted a drink or a regular meal. Never bothered to check and never came back. 2) They sold me a flight that had a 1.5 hours layover in Mexico City I wasn't aware of the whole customs-immigration-checking my bags again at MEX airport. If they know of this whole ordeal why would they sell flights with such short layovers? Food and service: Most staff were pleasant. The food was pretty decent and free drinks even alcoholic ones. The flight didn't have individual screens so there's only one movie option. They did have radio and gave headphones a pillow and a blanket. Overall it wasn't a bad experience. As a side note if you have a connection through Mexico airport and are pressed for time make sure you ask the personnel if you can't find something as its lacking some signs. The conveyor belt for my flight was in a separate room than most of the belts had I not asked someone I probably would've waited in vain.
336,"ATL-GRU via MEX. Thought I'd found a good value on a business class ticket that would let me earn skymiles. Wrong! I flew in business both ways but only got skymiles one direction because of the ""class of service"". (The leg where I got stuck in the middle seat is the one I earned miles on.) ""Middle seat in business class"" you might be saying? Why yes. Not the seat I reserved when I booked but the seating chart at that time didn't even show a middle seat. Would not recommend don't plan to fly again myself."
337,"Dublin-CDG return this was on a flex fare so not really in business class as such as business class is non existent on short haul flights. While the service from the cabin crew was friendly and efficient I note several issues that management needs to address. Flex fare entitles you to access to airport lounges. This needs to be made stress free for passengers. This time I received the invitation by email but as I had changed the dates as I am entitled to do I used the original lounge invitation (as no new invitation came by e-mail). No problems encountered in Dublin but while in Paris the staff in the Icare lounge came back to me while I was sitting down and eating to verify that the original lounge invitation reference matched my flight reference. I don't blame her as she was very apologetic for having had to do so. Surely if this is an issue for ground staff Aer Lingus should send a new invitation when you change the dates. In some previous flights the invitation did not come at all and Aer Lingus did not reply to my queries and there were issues getting access to the lounge without this ""invitation"". Perhaps Aer Lingus does not really bother with this as most people don't really bother with paying the higher flex fares. However for those who pay they should get what they pay for without any stress. I would also suggest that if you pay this fare you should at least be entitled to one meal and one drink on your flight since the fare costs 3 to 4 times more the cheaper fares. I will continue to use Aer Lingus as I live in Ireland and I find their cabin crew generally friendly and efficient but I hope management takes note of my comments and suggestions. If they don't address these issues they may find more and more people opt for their competitors like Ryanair."
338,Our flight from Belfast to Malaga was cancelled on the 8/4/2014 reasons unknown and we were moved to the 9th. This was unsuitable so I called the customer services and without any hassle we were moved to a flight departing Dublin for the original date. When we checked in via the self check in machine our pre booked seats had changed and when mentioned to the desk staff they quickly corrected our seats back to the original with a sincere apology. The morning flight was on an A330 the advantage to this was we had IFE for the short 3 hour flight but it was a welcomed bonus. Crew were friendly and accommodating to any request and seemed to enjoyed serving the customers with a smile even when it was a full flight. This was a faultless flight in every respect arriving at destination bang on time. I really can't fault this airline every single employee I had connect with either from the call center to the gate agents to the cabin crew made us feel welcomed. It is a shame that the return flight from Malaga to Belfast left to early for us otherwise I would have made this a return trip.
339,Roundtrip from Dulles International Airport to the Czech Republic stopping in Moscow. Dissatisfaction is the word that came to mind repeatedly during these series of flights. The food was excellent. Served on time and hot on each of these flights. Very consistent. The cost was excellent compared to other airlines offering the same trip. It was downhill from there. Of the total 4 flights required to make this trip zero were on time. Every single flight left late. This is clearly a normal practice for this Airline based on my experience. The initial flight to Moscow from Dulles (10 hours or so) had no working video displays for entertainment. There was working music but the headphone connector on the seat was shorted and would barley play sound in mono and only if held in a certain position. After landing and proceeding to the terminal in Moscow there was complete chaos. The airport appeared to be clean and new with lots of English signage however some of the people working in the terminal seemed to be avoiding anything that resembled being helpful. Most seemed to have attitudes for some reason. Russian passengers herded like cattle to the tiniest security checkpoint area that I have ever seen. There were 4 lanes for 300 people. The return flight was worse. After I reached Moscow from the Czech Republic there was more herding to the security checkpoint. This time a customs representative sat at a desk near by reading a book as a few hundred people waited in lines that barley moved. I asked the person reading the book if I was standing in a special line or something since the signs were not in English she responded that I should find another line in a tone that indicated the I was disturbing her. I eventually wasted an hour before I discovered that I was in the area of customs for domestic flights and not international. The International flight area took 3 minutes to process. This theme of herding and poor manners played out at every airport except for the final destination back in the US. I will never fly Aeroflot again. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.
340,Moscow-Hong Kong flight was well below my expectations. Terminal F has been revamped with too many shops and not enough seats. Passengers camped on the stairs and the floor. As there were other flights to China departing from nearby gates almost at the same time one can only imagine the pushing shouting and queue-jumping. Allocating more space to people and less to shops would help address the problem. We boarded on time but some passengers had so many duty-free shopping bags that overhead storage soon reached maximum capacity. Tempers flared departure was delayed. I had to keep my backpack under the seat thus reducing that precious little space. After takeoff we were told that the entertainment system was out of order. No films no music no games. nothing. I had ordered a vegetarian meal at the time of buying the ticket online 6 months earlier and this is usually a very tasty Asian- style hot meal. This time my name didn't appear on the flight attendants' list despite being clearly indicated in the electronic ticket in my possession. Flight attendants ignored the issue and just apologized for the mistake. The best they could offer was a normal tray with two small salads instead of one. A few hours later when they served breakfast I realised that 2 out of 3 standard options were ok for vegetarians. Why wasn't a breakfast tray offered to me at dinner time? Flight attendants started serving tea and coffee. Due to turbulence they had to stop serving hot drinks and at least 100 passengers were left without any hot beverages to accompany their breakfast. The turbulence ended but serving hot beverages was never resumed. All in all not the best experience.
341,The servers were very professional and efficient and the planes were good. Our flight out of St. Petersburg was a disaster due to the lack of communication and inattentive flight representatives. We were booked on a 6.30 am flight to Moscow and were finally rebooked for a 2.40 pm flight. We were at the airport at 4 am and the plane left at 3 pm - that's 11 hrs in the airport. We missed our connection from Moscow to NY finally arriving in Orlando with no luggage. It was a nightmare.
342,First time on Aegean for a family of 4 to go from Istanbul to Athens. Lines at airport moved fast no hassle on luggage flight left on time and arrived early seats were fairly comfortable and to our surprise we were offered a generous snack even though the flight was barely an hour duration. Overall superior in quality and service than any of the domestic flights we have taken in the US.
343,Paris-Athens-Mytilini. Compared to the competition this is the only option for Greece. Friendly service good hot food at lunch and evening flight with wine seat comfortable aircraft modern clean and on time. Overall very good.
344,Sydney to Buenos Aires return. The aircraft used for this route are old but seats are as comfortable as other airline's with more legroom than most. The meals were adequate if not great with ample self serve snacks. Drinks available throughout the flight and the service was polite and friendly. Taking my own entertainment (on a tablet) was no problem considering the savings being made on the price of the tickets compared to the prices charged by the competition. I also caught several Aerolineas regional flights in South America on new aircraft as it is are in the process of adding new aircraft to its fleet.
345,We flew on direct flights Sydney to BA return in September 2012 - the attraction of a lower business class fare than competitors and a direct flight swayed us into trying the airline. The outward flight left early from Sydney and arrived early in BA. The return flight left 30 minutes late but picked up the time on the way home. On both sectors the service was prompt and efficient. Food and wine was good but not presented as top tier carriers would present. The entertainment system was archaic limited and not on demand. This is well documented by other reviewers. We took kindles and an ipad and once we watched one movie we were quite happy to read and play. Views of the Antarctic ice sheet also kept us amused on the way home. Seats are old style business but we did sleep nearly 9 hours on the night flight on the way over. If this one experience is the norm for this sector I would recommend the business class offering given the price advantages - you can overcome the most significant weakness (IFE) by buying movies for your ipad and you can buy plenty for the saving in air fares.
346,I booked my trip to Santiago de Chile from San Francisco with AM just because they were skyteam partners. The inflight service was great. I was allowed to priority board with my delta silver status. I even got access to skyteam lounge in Santiago without asking. Food was a bit of a let down especially since I requested a vegetarian meal. Other than that the entertainment was good not hundreds of choices but I found the selection of movies and programs fresh and entertaining. All four legs of the flight were on time and staff were very helpful. Even though I didn't know any Spanish I was able to communicate which is often a problem. Overall be it luck or their usual code of conduct I had a great experience with AM and would recommend to any one. Economical and comfortable despite a 16 hour trip.
347,GDL to LAX. It was a very pleasant flight for many reasons. Staff were very friendly and willing to help with any question. The food served was good for a 3 hour flight. They served yoghurt with cookies and fruit. There was inflight entertainment but no option all that there was available is what they played. Overall I really liked this airline and am willing to fly with them in the future.
348,Our flight going over from JFK to Moscow was good as well as the food. However on the way back home from St. Petersburg is where all the problems started. Our original flight was delayed 12 hours which meant missing all our connections. We stood in line for 5 hours. The service at the airport was horrible. No one would help us get a flight. After many hours different lines talking to many representatives we made a call to our Travel Agent and the Emergency help number that we had. Only after these calls were we able to get another reservation home. The flight was fine but the on ground service is far from good or caring.
349,Sep 13 2013 back from Russia to the USA. Flight 1481 Moscow-New York. I have been travelling Aeroflot for many years but I have never had such an uncomfortable seat in my life. Seems like the seats were designed by Gestapo for torturing passengers for 10 hours. Short narrow leaned forward! I will never understand the purpose of the head piece which makes your head protrude forward even more unless you are more than 2 meters tall. I felt very uncomfortable and tired. It was especially bothersome due to slow food service (it took the flight attendants about 2 hours to serve lunch and tidy up).
350,SVO-HKG in the new 777-300 ER. Comfort is fantastic - I would say much better than even Cathay new business class let alone European airlines. Staff attention great. Food could be more imaginative and refined but generally very good quality. Lounge at SVO old terminal F is incredibly old and not good. I would recommend taking a short walk over to the lounge in the new terminal E instead. Aeroflot making a strong effort in long-haul business class to get closer to the leading airlines and is on the right track!
351,SKG to HER. Flight was on time! The plane an A320 Airbus was new and clean inside/out. Cabin crew was pleasant and caring the on board service was good even though the flight was just 1 hour. Seats were comfortable and you have the option to check in online! I have flown many times domestic and abroad and am always satisfied.
352,ATH-FRA. Another great experience with Aegean on a clean and relatively new aircraft with a meal served by polite and caring crew. Although a moving map was displayed throughout the cabin a movie or some other form of entertainment would have been appreciated for this 3-hour flight (I flew Aegean to London before and a movie was shown). Regardless this airline is a pleasure to fly.
353,London Heathrow to Larnaca. Among the most attentive and pleasant crew I have come across. Clean and new airbus food service was very good. Drink service frequent - around 5 times for a 4.5 hr flight. Overall very welcoming and pleasant.
354,"Lille to Algiers. The flight has been delayed (2hrs), but the Air Algerie's airport workers gave us some sandwiches and soft drinks to apologize for the delay, a good point. The cabin crew were very professional. The aircraft (B767) was clean and in a good shape. The meal was excellent. Tea, coffee, and soft drinks have been served inflight. We landed smoothly at Algiers. The ticket price was good, and includes in it 30kg of luggage. A very good experience with Air Algerie."
355,I recently flew with AR on the new direct SYD-EZE service. I must say after reading the previous reviews here that I was pleasantly surprised. Flights were on time cabin crew were friendly (more so on the return leg) seat pitch in economy was actually very good cabin was clean and tidy. Yes there are no back of seat entertainment screens but for the price you cannot expect 5 star services. If being entertained is an issue bring your ipad or a good book! Food was OK. On the return flight after dinner service sandwiches were self- served from the rear of the cabin and it would be beneficial here to at least offer a selection (for us veggies rather than the ubiquitous ham and cheese). Overall the flight was as good as any for the price ??in fact the worst part was actually going through customs at EZE  which took well over an hour. I thought I had landed at LAX! Overall I would recommend this airline if you are after a well-priced airfare ??just don't expect 5 star amenities services for a 3 star price.
356,I had an excellent flight from MEX to JFK on New Year's Day on one of their new 787s. Check-in staff was helpful and well-organized. We boarded and left on time. Cabin staff was professional and friendly; the breakfast frittata was great and there was a variety of movies to choose from during the flight. They even offered wine in Economy Class. The 787 is a great plane and flying in this plane was a great experience. We arrived at JFK 30 minutes early.
357,I had a positive experience with Aeromexico from JFK to MEX via Cancun on Christmas. JFK check-in was efficient with no extra fees for checking a bag. They also served complimentary breakfast which was a decent omelette. Cabin staff was friendly and professional. We left and arrived on time. I had a 3-hour layover before taking a flight to Toluca (at a bargain fare) and asked Cancun check-in staff if I could change that leg of the trip to MEX. I was switched to an earlier CUN-MEX flight at no extra charge. The aircraft from CUN to MEX was brand new and spotlessly clean. We left and arrived on time.
358,Round trip to New York (EI 105/104). Flight out on time and the food was pretty decent I had upgraded my meal choice. Pretty quiet flight not too busy and plenty of space to stretch out although the middle armrest not lifting up all the way is pretty annoying if you're trying to spread out a bit. Fantastic crew. Return flight was fine food not as good and again great crew. However why is this flight scheduled to leave at the time it does (5.30 pm) and then arrive into Dublin 5.5 hours later it's fast but when you land in Ireland it's still only 11 pm in NYC. If the flight is that short and apparently it regularly is then could it not be scheduled it to arrive in Ireland the same day as it leaves NYC. Also I think it was a surprise to ground crew that we got back so early as we had to wait 50 mins for bags to arrive. Aside from that though good round trip.
359,Flew JFK to LHR with family of 5 and overall was very satisfied. Transatlantic flights were not full and the whole family had extra room. Only irritating issues were too many announcements which kept everybody awake and seat armrests which do not come up all the way allowing one to stretch out over empty seats. Dublin to London flights were also good. Although we would have preferred direct flights the savings going through Dublin were substantial and well worth the slight inconvenience plus on the way home one goes through Immigration in Ireland which works very well.
360,In the last year I have flown TLV-SVO and return about 5 times. Good service very friendly staff new aircraft's - every time I have had very good experience.
361,Flew YYZ-MOW-YYZ. Both flights were excellent. Sheremetyevo airport very modern comfortable there was barely any line-up for customs and security screenings. Security was painless compared to the US and Canadian ones. Food was great I asked for an extra meal on both flights and they gave it to me. The offered wine for free in economy class. FA also friendly. The only concern is the delays. When I flew there the delay was 40 min on the way back the washroom broke down in the aircraft so the delay was 4 hours. They gave us meal vouchers so we got free food at SVO.
362,LCA-LHR on a nice clean A321. Aircraft left Larnaca on time cabin crew looked smart and were polite I had paid only Â£80 for my one way flight value for money was excellent as all drinks and food was included. Although cabin crew only came round I think 3 times on the 5 hour flight drinks were available on request if needed and cabin crew were happy to serve from the galley. In flight meal was average I find catering on all flights from Larnaca not that great! Seat was comfortable and I had plenty of leg room pilot kept us updated on arrival times and the weather back in the UK which is always nice to know you're going to land bang on time. Despite the bad weather in London landing was probably the smoothest I've ever had on a flight didn't know I had touched the ground! Just wish A3 didn't fly into Terminal 1 at LHR as its not that great and is rather run down other than that Aegean cannot be faulted. A great little airline and I will definitely fly with them again to Greece or Cyprus!
363,Flew Aegean to Santorini late June. Short and sweet flight. Cabin crew were professional and aircraft very clean. There was no food and inflight entertainment because of short flight nice gesture providing passengers with a light refreshment.
364,Paris to Algiers then to Ouagadougou and back. Overall I found this airline good value for money: they are cheap and offer minimal service. The aircraft's were old but kept in a good state except for the washrooms which were disgusting. Seats were rather comfortable. On the Algiers-Ouagadougou leg 1st class seating was attributed randomly to economy passengers. The meals were excellent even on the shorter Paris-Algiers flights. The food is halal but wine is available. Of my 4 flights only one was late by about one hour. No information whatsoever was given while we were waiting but the crew apologised once we were let in.
365,"Nov 1 Algiers-Ghardaia by ATR 72. 1 hrs late departure due to late arrival of the aircraft. Confusing as destination ""Oran"" was shown at the departure gate. Flight full. Some biscuits water and a soft drink was provided. Announcements in French and Arabic only. It is a domestic flight but on arrival and departure immigration has to been cleared. Return Nov 3 Flight on-time long wait for the luggage in Algiers because of a parking problem. Airline recommended as flying is better than 10 hrs by bus."
366,SYD-EZE-SYD. Plane is an older A340-200 - without personal IFE - just a main screen. Economy class seats were generously sized and I was offered an emergency exit seat from SYD-EZE. EZE-SYD was a standard economy class seat. Plane departed on time from SYD-EZE and again EZE-SYD. Staff friendly and always walking around. Food was edible but there wasn't much of it. A small self-serve bar in the galley provided water and snacks during the flight. Both flights the plane landed on time and overall was a pleasant experience. Despite being limited in features I got from SYD to EZE and back cheaply comfortably and if you bring your iPad/iPod you'll be entertained. If there was no price difference between AR and LAN/Qantas etc. consider going on the latter. But AR isn't a bad airline provided you've got some personal entertainment on the long 13-15 hour flights. One final point - the AR website is incredibly hard to navigate and use. Calls to their SYD call centre go without answer.
367,Well after hearing a lots of negetive comments about Aerlineas airlines I was a bit apprehensive but the fare was almost half from MEL-RIO. I found the service better and aircraft was old but with more legroom. The crew was also good and trying to help passengers as it was a long flight of 16 hrs. Food was OK and they should improve their entertainment service. Overall we enjoyed and would definitely go again.
368,Return flight (Sydney-Buenos Aires). The fare was really competitive. Flight left on time from Sydney to Buenos Aires. Food was below average (Fish and rice for dinner and very small sandwiches for breakfast and middle snack). On board entertainment is the worst entertainment I have witnessed. Flight attendants were nice. On my way back flight delayed 30 minutes. Food was good (Chicken and rice for lunch. Croissant tea and fruits for breakfast and small chicken sandwich for middle snack). On board entertainment was better than the first flight. Pros: Excellent price - On time flights - Friendly staff. Cons: No personal entertainment nor good screens - Bad food on first flight - Staff didn't allow me to use my iphone in flight mode - not very tidy (though not dirty).
369,I had a great experience with Aeromexico on a round trip from Las Vegas to Guadalajara. The aircraft was very clean. The loading process was efficient and quick. The flight attendants were very professional and all were bi- lingual. The entire staff of Aeromexico were pleasant and concerned with customer satisfaction.
370,BHD-LGW A319 January. Perfectly acceptable short flight with friendly crew. Boarding is slow because all managed by just 1 person.
371,Flew with Aer Lingus round trip Dublin-Gatwick this week. Very pleased with the service overall. The outbound flight on Tuesday was lightly booked and we got away early. Terminal 2 is very pleasant to use and even the security area was moving quickly. This was the first time I had used the pre-order meal service and it worked well in getting the breakfast before the main cabin service began. It is good value and I would estimate that about 10 of the 50 or so passengers had pre-ordered. Coming back was even easier at Gatwick airport and this was an almost full flight. The cabin crew were especially good. I ordered tea and the cheese board (could do with a little more cheese). Weather was bad coming into Dublin in the aftermath of the storms and I could tell we weren't going to be able to land from the approach and just before touchdown we went on a go around. The Captain came on and was very re-assuring and explained what had happened and again the cabin crew were very reassuring in making the extra safety announcements. Nice experience and nice product and great crew.
372,MAN-DUB return. Outbound delayed an hour due to problem with something in hold and had rubbish on floor when boarded return delayed almost an hour due to knock on delay. Attendants were nice both journeys.
373,CWL-DUB and DUB-CWL flight EI3291 29/10/13. Outbound - The flight attendants always had a smile and were very helpful throughout. The only negative thing about the outbound flight was that there was a mother that did nothing but shout at her kids from the moment we took off until the moment we landed and when your flight is at 8.30 in the morning it's the last thing you want. Inbound flight DUB-CWL flight EI3298 31/10/13 - we left Dublin later than scheduled due to the fact there was a technical fault with a light in the cockpit and could not take off until it was solved. Within minutes engineers were onboard and both the captain and flight attendants kept us up to date with what was going on and reassuring us that everything was going well. The flight attendants on the inbound flight were much friendlier and talkative which is a great thing to have on an airline. Even though our flight departed late we landed just 5 minutes later than scheduled. I have recommended this airline to family and friends and actually me and a friend have booked to go back to Ireland with Aer Lingus on the new BRS-SNN route in April! Looking forward to it!
374,We flew JFK to Moscow and the returned St Petersburg through Moscow to JFK an 8 to 9 hour flight. All aspects were better than most carriers I have flown. Check in was professional the flight attendants were attentive the two meals served and the food tasted good to very good. The plane an Airbus 300 as I recall was clean and in good condition. The entertainment system gave free movies (free ear buds handed out) music and TV. The luggage arrived with us. The connection in Moscow was easy. I have only good things to say about my experience with Aeroflot. I would absolutely fly them again and the cost was about 1/2 what it would have been on Air France.
375,Krasnodar - Moscow - Omsk. Check-in in Krasnodar was chaotic and no drop bags and run counter. (It was peak summer season). The actual flights were OK. I received my preferred seats on both flights and quite good English spoken by cabin staff. Reasonable meals were served on both flights evening though the Omsk sector started at 1.40 am. Both sectors were fairly well on time although departing Krasnodar was a little late (because of the problems with checking in. No entertainment on either flight - both around 3 hours).
376,CDG-MOW-OVB. Upgraded to business class. Compared with Air France Aeroflot offers a great service in business class with a small gift and more choice of meals. Easy transfer at MOW. Flew an A320 with a good seat. No difficulties to sleep. Back in a IL96 nice 4 hr flight with a consistent breakfast (two choices). Crew sometimes rude but overall friendly. Lounge in MOW very quiet not many people attending. MOW-CDG on time again good service good (hot) meal and nice crew. Very good value for the money.
377,I am a Gold member in both Greek airlines (Aegean-Olympic Air) traveling over 100 times a year and I have to admit that Aegean Air is highly recommended especially in Ground services (Lounges - Luggage priority services). They are excellent in the following services: Great Lounges with separate room for smokers. Good luggage priority service in Greece. They must improve the following: Offer free 24h parking just like Olympic Air offer for their Gold members. Improve their unacceptable prices and value for money for local flights. Dramatically improve their in flight food for local flights.
378,ATH - LHR sector on new Airbus A320. Very clean inside and out. Flight departed on time with pre-take off drinks in Business. Comfortable blue leather seats with the middle seat free allowing more room. Attractive and attentive crew service with a smile and very polite. Dinner was a choice from a menu which was plentiful and delicious with a good selection of Greek wines to accompany the meal. Headsets given out and a film shown during the flight. Regular water service throughout with pretzels and snacks. Excellent business product and would definitely use Aegean again.
379,CDG to ATH. Great experience. Hot dinner was served entertainment was available (which is not the case on the competing companies on that route). Flight on time. Staff was very friendly and professional.
380,Went from SKG to STR and after a week the other way around. My flights were A3510 and A3511. Excellent aircraft clean no malfunctioning seats inflight maps 2 captain announcements one the standard and one extra that we would experience some turbulence over Belgrade. Star-Alliance stylished meals served hot enough beverage and coffee happy to help flight attendants ultra-fast baggage drop-off and mobile check- in. I didn't even have to print my boarding pass. Highly recommended!
381,Frankfurt to Annaba this Summer return. The age of the plane from FFM to Alger was pretty old. The Alger- Annaba flight the same. On the return both planes were new. There was no delay. Service on the ground and onboard is ok. Food was excellent even during Ramadan. Take care at the Airport especially on the way from the international to the domestic Airport in Alger! Don't give anybody your papers except if you are sure they are really officials.
382,SYD-EZE on July 21. While the aircraft was old and it lacks personal inflight entertainment it was well maintained. Good legroom. Crew were friendly and efficient. Left on time and arrived one hour early. All and all a good experience and extremely good value for money. I'm looking forward to my return in a few days.
383,Paris-Cork EI821 Dec 23 return Cork-CDG Dec 30. I travelled with Aer Lingus over Christmas/New Year. Very busy. Staff were very pleasant and unlike another airline on this route treating passengers with respect or weren't out-to-get me because I had a shopping bag with my carry-on coming on board. The staff make this airline very pleasant.
384,"Moscow to LHR. Flight delayed though just half an hour then bussed from Terminal D to the far side of F. Bus stopped about a hundred metres from the steps to the aircraft as the heavens opened. 50 people ran at once to try to escape the deluge. Utter chaos and appalling management by Aeroflot. Cabin crew were singularly unhelpful saying to a passenger who complained ""it's not our decision"". It took a good half hour from when the door was closed to take off which added to the frustration of the delay. But once airborne things took a turn for the better. The Cain crew were personable and efficient. Dinner was served promptly and was tasty. Impressive too was the nutritional information next to each dish - calories protein carbohydrates. The Italian red wine was more drinkable than many I've had elsewhere. IFE was via individual players that were handed out after a polite request. Reasonable selection of films. Spent a further frustrating 30 minutes in the hold before landing 90 minutes late. Luggage took another 20 or so - definitely not treated as priority. Despite some positive aspects overall this was a disappointing experience."
385,Moscow-Tenerife on A330-300 long haul. The service was incredible (actually as usual on Aeroflot long haul flights in business class compared to short haul it is better). Our plane was delayed but we arrived only 7 minutes later than it was proposed). Cabin was originally designed for EgyptAir and it was very good. Entertainment system has a big variety of films and all films can be watched in either Russian or English. In my opinion Aeroflot on long hauls is much better than the majority of other European airlines.
386,London to Hong Kong via Moscow return. All flights you couldn't fault food of good standard flight attendants smart and professional great selection of entertainment only problem was other passengers getting up before plane had stopped at terminals. You know who you are and it makes life very difficult for the flight attendants.
387,I like to fly with A3 but the last flights (CFU-ATH-MUC) were the opposite. Since we were flying back home to ZRH we wanted to have all boarding cards. But for some reason we only got them until MUC. When I asked the lady at the check in she said Sorry I cannot help. You have to organise yourself in MUC. On both flights the flight attendants wanted to be somewhere else but on the flights. The food this time was inedible and the service awful. For a glass of water I had to ask 3 times and when she finally brought it she just rolled her eyes. I am not sure if I will fly with them again.
388,Charter service from Tel Aviv to Heraklion. A320 new and clean all leather seats. Only drinks served. All female crew seemed completely disinterested. Airshow available however no position of the aircraft available only the map of the area. Heard good things about A3 service however that was not the experience we had.
389,On 16-JUN my flight from Milan to Athens (connecting to Mykonos) which was suppose to leave at 21.10 left at 02.00. We were given little info other than plane broken and a new one coming from Athens. When the new plane arrived the ground staff and gate were disorganized making the delay even longer. During this extreme delay we were given snacks and water. Once arriving into Athens and missing my flight to JMK a ticket agent helped us and put us on a departure getting us in only a few hours late on Olympic. I emailed Aegean three times to enquire about a refund or another ticket (As we were instructed to do both in MXP and ATH) and it took two emails to get a response. Overall Aegean usually pretty good (I fly once or twice a year) but this interaction made me lose some trust.
390,Flew from Athens to Santorini in a new A321 aircraft. Economy seats were leather and soft and comfortable and the luggage bins were very large (I was able to fit my acoustic guitar in the cabin). The views as the flight took off and landed were incredible but the flight tickets were slightly expensive for such a short distance. Inflight entertainment was unfortunately absent as the flight (1hr) was too short for it and beverages were only served to half the passengers for the same reason. Otherwise it was a good trip.
391,LYS-ORN. Clean and new aircraft FA's could be a little more professional. Nice complete meal. I am used to taking this airline to go to Algeria and it is really improving.
392,ALG-AAE. The flight to Annaba took 1hr and was uneventful. Air Algerie will always serve you a drink and a close an eye to your baggage allowance which is good. But service is non-descript and like many airlines of North Africa when there is a problem there is nobody to speak to and nobody is responsible for anything. So when flying them have lots of time on your hand patience and a good book. Their prices are usually good especially for domestic flights. Would fly them again but as I said it is nothing memorable.
393,TUN-ALG in the new 737-800NG (Business Class) a very good trip no delay good meat (champagne before take off). On time at Algiers clean cabin a very large seat and big space not like Air France or Alitalia in Business Class.
394,Buenos Aires to Salta to Iguazu. Bit apprehensive after reading reviews but both flights were fine. Punctual efficient and even a decent snack. Both were on Embraer 190 operated by Austral and the second craft was new - excellent seats and seat-back IFE with personal headsets on a flight of less than 2 hours.
395,I have flown a number of long distance and internal flights and am pleased with the airline. The international flight has the biggest leg room and is very comfortable. No TV's but not a problem - bring your own entertainment. Food is mediocre but drinks are served regularly. Internal flights are good - they new Embraers are great and the new B737's have suitable legroom. The Virgin sourced planes are tight in terms of legroom. The website is great and service when things go wrong is also friendly and good.
396,CPH-SVO-DXB-NBO. Smooth check in all flights briefly on time and connections smooth. Lounge access given at all concerned airports as being Skyteam Gold (though AF). CPH-SVO on Airbus 321. Flight basically full. Service fine but sparse. Alcoholic drinks for sale only. A cold lunch tray given quality acceptable. Seat good was given a spacious emergency seat. Bus to terminals in SVO. SVO-DXB on Airbus 319. No IFE but who cares. 16 seats left in economy I volunteered to give up seat 7C to the back row next to toilets as it allowed for stretching. Service devoted. Alcohol charged as only free on intercontinental flights. I would assume that SVO-DXB is pretty much intercontinental? Service excellent though by sitting on last row one is left with no food options but the ones left (clalf-meat) was good. English poor-very poor. Staff charming young and in excellent mood. DXB-NBO operated by Kenya Airways. Overbooked on business class 1 person was downgraded. I got one of the very last seats in the middle of an 2-3-2 configuration. But the staff were good hard-working in a sparkling mood and attentive. Ordered 2 drinks and was given 2 of each (as to make up for busy FAs and few rounds of service). This happened to everybody who cared but only at the first service - IFE on large plenum screen worked surprisingly well. Good information from captain and purser. Luggage delivery at the belts in Nairobi stressful and confusing. Monitors were not properly working.
397,Flight SU2619 BRU-SVO on 19/06/2013 SU2 SVO-LED on 20/06/2013. Flight arrived on time in Brussels and in Moscow. Staff very friendly. Food on board was OK but could (should) have been warmer. Plane (Airbus A319) was clean. In-flight shopping is rather expensive. Connecting flight to St Petersburg was OK. Plane (Airbus A320) was clean food on board was OK (very good to be honest). Both flights were in time. Just a pity that it is not possible to check in at Brussels Airport for the connecting flight to St Petersburg. Check-in by Internet also not possible.
398,Flight SU23/SU2618 LED-SVO / SVO-BRU 23/06/2013. Check in at Poltava was OK. It was possible to check in for the connecting flight to Brussels. Flight LED-SVO got a delay of almost 25 minutes. Probably the delay was caused by the used plane (Airbus A330 i.o. A320). It takes more time to board 320 people instead of 120. Plane was clean service on board was OK. Staff very friendly. Due to the delay our transit time was extremely short. We had to run to catch the connecting flight. Connecting flight was on schedule. Plane (Airbus 319) was clean service on board was great. We arrived on time in Brussels and unbelievably our luggage was on board and arrived as well!
399,SGN-SVO-CPH. Economy class. Check-in in Saigon perfect painless and very accepting to wishes. Recognized Skyteam gold status and granted lounge access in Saigon as well as in SVO. Galaktika lounge in SVO had to inquire lounge card at transfer desk. Could choose any of 5(?) lounges. Flight SGN to SVO on Airbus 330-200. Approx. only 60% load was lucky to get some sleep as I needed it though day flight. News for international Aeroflot: they (again) serve wine (free) at economy-class though of limited quality! Good food 2 hot dishes offered at lunch at my seat (behind) only one choice left namely fish which however always is my first choice. Starter was mayonnaise marinated potatoes with red fish meat. Main dish was rice/catfish (white fish meat). Fantastic films on IFE! Small screens but easy to operate and good selection of films including some Russian movies of high quality. Staff nice and caring especially when speaking loud slow clear and polite English to them as their English is at times limited. Stewardesses were appealing dressed in neat smart orange-coloured summer uniforms! SVO-CPH in smaller Sukhoi jet which is nice similar to Airbus 319. Eventless trip soft drinks snack served (3 hours flight). Everything functioned OK. Arrived 20 minutes late due to long take-off cue of aircraft's waiting for permission.
400,"The flight was good, the price of the ticket was low - about AED 900. For the money we paid the service was really good, there are some problems like there is no food provided so we had to buy this onboard the plane. We did not have personal TV and the inflight entertainment was poor but the cabin crew service was good. I recommend if you want a cheap ticket with good service, but no entertainment onboard."
401,TLV-HER and back. It was a charter flight so I expected a bad experience but was pleasantly surprised. We left on time. The A320 was new and clean. The cabin crew were very helpful and nice. Very informative announcements by the captain. Good leg space.
402,Paris to Corfu via Athens. All flights were on time aboard newish A320. Food served was ok not great. Absolutely nothing to complain about and the views of the coast were spectacular!
403,Athens to London in economy. The flight departed on time and arrived 10 mins early. Very tasty meal served on board much bigger than expected. Several rounds of drinks movies shown during flight. Very attentive cabin staff. Overall an excellent flight for just EUR70.
404,MIA-EZE round trip and AEP-UAQ. Service on the long haul was great from reservation process through check- in and inflight. Airbus 340 from and back to Miami had spacious economy class seats and attentive flight attendants. Onboard entertainment on the long haul was rudimentary at best and food was the worst airline food ever. Embraer 190 used on subsidiary Austral between AEP and UAQ was clean: spacious and had in- seat state of the art entertainment and refreshments. Had mobility issues and Aerolineas staff went the extra mile to take care of me. Favourable contrast in ground service with US carrier on arrival back to MIA was notable.
405,Salta to Mendoza on E190 and was impressed. On time newish and clean plane snack box with drink for short flight and even some seatback IFE was available. FA's were professional at all times but perhaps a little devoid of smiles.
406,Madrid - Dublin EI 595 22/12/13. Check/baggage drop in Madrid (sub contractor) slow inefficient. Aircraft clean comfortable. Punctuality slight delay on departure arrival on time. Flight attendants efficient friendly and very professional. Greatly improved offerings of food on board at reasonable prices. Baggage delivered speedily on arrival in Dublin. Altogether excellent flight and service. They do however need to watch that they are not let down by ground handling agents.
407,We have become regular business class passengers on Aer Lingus & they never fail to impress. This time we flew from Dublin to Orlando on EI 121 and returned from New York on EI 104. On both flights the service was quite outstanding. The crew are friendly but professional and the food and wine selections were of high end restaurant quality. Given our experience with other carriers business class usually at much higher fares the Aer Lingus product has to be one of the best available. We only wish they would once again provide a premium offering on European routes.
408,Recently I flew from St Petersburg - Moscow - NYC. It was an extremely pleasant flight. The seating (in economy) was A+ the meals were very well presented and the food was delicious. The FA's were well dressed polite and professional.
409,18 May: HAJ-SVO 25 May: SVO-ZRH. In the last month I was fortunate to travel with them twice. Both flights were consistently excellent. The food is amazing in terms of choice taste wine list and the service. I look forward to my next experience with Aeroflot business.
410,Sydney to Moscow and return in May 2013. Hong Kong to Moscow and return was in business class with Aeroflot. Very impressed. Seats on flight to Moscow were of an older type of business class seat but did everything I needed and all ancillary services (entertainment etc.) available. Seafood meal was probably the best airline meal I have ever had. (Expectations high but I think reasonable). On return flight had more recent capsule seats. Airbus planes looked new and counter service very good. Had domestic Aeroflot connection in Moscow to St Petersburg. Had to sprint from terminal F to D but made good time and domestic counter service again efficient and friendly. All planes on time.
411,A320 flight Sharjah-Yanbu (Saudi Arabia) on 16 Sept. Great flight. Check-in was easy and agent offered me a pass to the Biz Lounge for AED 100 with food wifi drinks. Lounge was nice but wifi didn't work - not a big deal. Flight boarded via bus so nice to walk up the plane. Flight attendants very friendly - speaking 8 languages so very diverse. Safety video is the best ever! All done with children so you really want to watch and pay attention. Ordered a turkey sandwich which was large and very tasty. Smooth flight and landed 10 min early. Really enjoyed the airline and flight.
412,30 January to 01 February. Jeddah - Sharjah - Jeddah. Reservation completed online with no difficulty. As a LCC Air Arabia offers free carry on luggage and additional checked baggage for SR 50. Also offered confirmed seat for SR 50. I took the seat confirmation on both legs. Did not take advantage of the advance purchase meal offer nor did I purchase anything to eat on the flights. Inflight entertainment on A320 was suitable for a short haul flight. Seats were comfortable and flight attendants professional and efficient. On board sky sales were relatively affordable but I did not notice any major brand names. Interesting boarding and seating announcements were started while passengers were boarding rather than after the doors had closed. I thought this was a good use of crew time. I have flown Air Arabia Jeddah to Sharjah before and have enjoyed my flights I prefer the route rather than the Jeddah Dubai flight to avoid the hustle and bustle in Dubai airport. All in all a very enjoyable trip.
413,LHR-ATH return. Found Aegean to be very average. Flight out delayed by 2 hours due to high winds with gate attendants 'managing expectations' stringing the delay out by 10 minutes every 15 that went by; however the return was on time. A321's seats are closely bunched for leg room and lack any head rests making sleep tricky on the longish flight. Cabin service was just slow meals of dismal quality in both directions though wine pleasant. A film was shown in both directions which worked OK. Some crew were friendly others were not focused. Online check-in works well but won't from their own iphone app. Experience at both airports fine. I enjoyed the BA experience more on this route for the quality of the product onboard.
414,LHR-ATH. A good experience with Aegean the overnight flight was fairly busy but the crew were professional there were 2 drink runs and the meal was very good but the portions were small. A320 was clean and the leather seats were comfortable. Headsets were handed out there was a good music selection and a movie was shown on the overhead screens. Flight arrived into Athens a few minutes early and the luggage didn't take too long to appear. An extremely good service and would use them again without hesitation.
415,Flew Aerolineas/Austral on a domestic flight AEP-IGR and I have nothing to complain about. Check-in was good. Fairly new planes (E190) with IFE even for this short flight of slightly less than 2 hours. Was served a sandwich and something to drink.
416,"Flying on the now retired Boeing 474-400 from Buenos Aires to Madrid. Even though it didn't have an entertainment device (just an old 15"" TV on the roof) the seats were really comfortable with good recline. Food wasn't bad and the service was extremely friendly and helpful. Flight delayed 30 mins but arrived on time. Return flight on the same aircraft."
417,Contrary to what a lot of people are putting here I had a very good experience with Aeromexico. I was departing from SJO (San Jose Costa Rica) to MEX (Mexico DF). Airline prices change too often and I bought my ticket well ahead of time to get it for a cheap price for a major carrier! Even while still in the airport as I am a nervous flyer the captain was nice enough to reassure me about the flight. On-board the flight attendants were very nice and friendly even giving me advise on what transportation to take to specific tourist places in Mexico city for a first-timer in the city. The food was okay and the movie was ok though I bought my own set of entertainment myself. All in all the flight and service was pretty good.
418,"11/11/2013 my companion and I flew from San Antonio to Chicago and there caught Aer Lingus Flight EI124. The Aircraft was an Airbus 330. The Senior Crew Flight attendant was a very compassionate woman who attended to us and all of those around us with interest and tenacity. The seats we paid $50 extra were extra leg room (perfect) the seat itself for me (I have a 44"" waist was tight but tolerable). The food was very good (Lasagne) and the later sandwich (ham and cheese) was also very good and unexpected. Great flight. The return trip on 11/18/2013 Flight EI125 we thought OK now we'll see how it is in comparison. The Male Flight Attendant and also Senior Crew member was great as well. We had the same seats on the opposite side of the cabin. The amenities of even economy class on this Airline are excellent and a great value. The equipment is first class and the crew made me proud to be Irish American."
419,Use regularly on the ORD-DUB route as well as on its European short-haul routes. The transatlantic flights are always pleasant clean aircraft with friendly staff. IFE is adequate with personal seat-back TVs. Only complaints are that the economy seats are pretty hard and uncomfortable - they're actually nicer on the short-haul flights. I usually have to sit on the pillow to be comfortable. Also the departure gate area at ORD is too small for the number of passengers on the flight - numerous passengers end up standing and sitting on the floor in the hallway. Never had any serious issues with flight delays or baggage issues. Aer Lingus is head-and-shoulders above its only competition on the ORD-DUB route (AA) and its the clear choice for transatlantic flights to Ireland.
420,OVB-SVO-OVB (Novosibirsk) 1 week ago. Everything was OK on time. Plane was new A-320. Good meal and drink good attitude of FA's. At check-in I asked for an emergency exit seat - no problem.
421,Very good service they served two meals - dinner and breakfast and both times offered two choices (none of the USA airlines would feed you twice for free). They also offered free wine. All amenities were free of charge they offered newspapers free of charge (Russian newspapers though). The entertainment was poor. Cannot complaint about the 767 comfort.
422,Trivandrum to Sharjah and return. Being a frequent flyer on this route in my opinion Air Arabia is one of the best low cost carriers I have flown. Every time the flights were on time clean and tidy with not so bad seats and leg space. Food available for purchase on board was reasonable and quite good. Overall a very good value for money and a highly dependable airline for sticking on to the schedule every time.
423,Bangalore-Sharjah. Despite leaving at ungodly hours 3.30am in my case this is probably one of my favourite low cost carriers and in my opinion better than some full service airlines that fly from the middle east to India. Plane was clean and service was excellent plane half empty so had whole row to sleep. Since leaving so early in the morning lights are switched off early overall happy with the service Air Arabia provides.
424,LHR-ATH-LHR. Clean new Airbus 320 aircraft. Seats not perfect but good legroom compensates this. A selection of nice music before take off helps you fall in the good travelling mode. Both flights ahead of schedule. I'm scared of flying so a smiling and helpful flight attendants attitude definitely helped. Sweets before take off a small but nice touch. Decent proper meal with honest wine that actually tasted good. Overall a very good airline which helped me begin my holidays few hours before reaching Greece and prolonged it for a few hours when I was leaving.
425,Heathrow to Larnaca return. Aircraft A321 clean and tidy. Departed and arrived on time both ways. Good food inflight entertainment free drinks great service and friendly crew. Booked well in advance and got a great price. All in all a very good airline.
426,Flight late departing Nashville to Cancun but made good time and arrived near original time. Plane clean cabin personnel courteous almost robot-like neatly dressed. Apparently the flight time from Nashville to Cancun is not a 'meal or snack' flight. We were offered complimentary sodas juice beer mixed drinks and a small cup of mixed nuts - one time - for our 2 hour 40 minute flight at 11am. We never saw the cabin attendants again until we landed. Should have used the call button for another drink! If price is good I would fly them again but I would definitely be more prepared with a meal purchased at the airport. The return flight was the same - invisible attendants except for initial drink. The gate attendant said we would receive a snack as the flight left at 6:30pm - guess what no snack just more nuts! Cannot rate food or entertainment. Entertainment was radio only with ear plug set passed out and collected before landing.
427,Several Flights domestic Mexico last March. MEX-CUN MEX-GDL MEX-VER. In general good price and good product for economy. Check in process in Mexico City fast and easy. Security control always very fast also no lines. Boarding process organized. On board always free snack. Departed and arrival on time most of the time only one time 10 min late. FA always nice. Bags fast on belt. Recommended.
428,Buenos Aires - Mexico - Las Vegas - Mexico - Buenos Aires. Most flights were on time and crew were friendly. For both long haul flights (EZE-MEX-EZE) the aircraft was a 767 without IFE. Food was quite good crew kept constantly giving out glasses of water tea or coffee even in MEX-EZE a 500ml bottle of water was on every economy class seat. If I get the chance I will fly them again.
429,I was rebooked with Aer lingus to Dublin after our BA flight was cancelled due to technical difficulties. We were very impressed with the friendly and professional service offered. The aircraft was spotless fresh and bright. The crew kept us informed of our progress and had issued a very warm welcome on boarding. On the downside we had booked on a full service airline where drinks and a snack were included on Aer Lingus you pay. However the full breakfast I ordered was delicious and well worth the money. I look forward to booking with you in the future.
430,Overall: You get what you pay for. Cheap flight from IAD to IST via SVO. Flight was delayed from DC. No reason given or even boarding announcement. Strange things: inflight safety video on old 767 was set to techno music first in-flight movie on overhead screens was a 1940s black-and-white Soviet film with English subtitles and they serve drinks about 20 minutes before meals so you're thirsty again by the time you eat. Food was bad except for breakfast pancakes which were really good. Bring own food and entertainment.
431,Hamburg-Moscow-Shanghai. HAM-SVO on A320 smooth check-In with 2 boarding passes (HAM-SVO and SVO- PVG). C-lounge with basic refreshment. HAM-SVO C class cabin seat and service were excellent. Arrival at SVO new Terminal D quick and easy transit at both passport/security. SVO-PVG departed from Terminal F very long walkway from D to F. Terminal F awful old/dark/busy. Lounge at Terminal F was difficult to find. I was refused entry because I did not have the invitation card. Had to go to transit desk. After entering I noted the lounge was full no seat available. Flight to Shanghai on time with new and clean A330. Seats 2-2-2 not full flat but comfortable to sleep. Good onboard service greeting by purser/crews with good English skill. Foods (3 choices) very tasty. AVOD with 500 programs. Return: quick check-in with 2 boarding passes good spacious lounge. Flight PVG-SVO at 1.30 am. Old/tired B767 seat 2-2-2 narrow and less comfortable than A330 portable IFE with DVD-player same good onboard service. Landed at Terminal F and lesson learned went to transit desk asking for C-Lounge Access card. SVO-HAM A320 left Terminal D on time with best European C Class cabin I have flown. Good products with following minus points: No priority boarding on all legs no priority handling of baggage chaotic handling at SVO Airport.
432,CMN-BRU. For a LCC Air Arabia has been a welcome surprise. They offer you 20 kg baggage allowance new airplanes decent seats and a fresh crew. For a price/quality comparison they are better than Air Maroc. But their website is often malfunctioning certain routes are deleted without notice time tables suddenly change and they often leave at ungodly hours. I'm satisfied with this airline and will keep flying them if they keep their standards to the current level.
433,Mumbai to Istanbul Sabiha via Sharjah. A320 with comfortable seat TVs on board for entertainment. The crew was polite and patient. After landing Sharjah I had to wait more than 12 hours for going to Istanbul. Airport is small but comfortable. I am satisfied with the services of Air Arabia and the cheap flight.
434,Sharjah to Beirut 55 Euros only. Sharjah airport consistently decaying and becoming more dirty every time. The aircraft this time was quite worn-out and not clean : seats windows. The major complaint would be the absence of free of charge water such as on some other LCC.
435,ATH-LHR A321. Some things never change. Food inedible I knew this so I went onboard with a full stomach. I understand priority luggage should come first but not 10 minutes before everyone else's! I have noticed this on a couple of Aegean flights. Plane was new and clean as always cabin crew decent. Aegean if you want those extra stars you need better food better luggage handling services and more happy faces!
436,Athens to Frankfurt. Nice lounge at Athens with good selection of food. Flight average food terrible breakfast consisted of burnt pasty offering and a bread roll. Overall a fair offering but given the reviews was expecting more.
437,Thessaloniki-Samos return. Airbus A319 both ways. Flights full. Attentive crew nice flights drinks served for a 50 minutes flight. Recommended.
438,I flew from Mexico to Paris and Paris to Mexico. First flight was good I boarded in terminal 2 in Mexico city's international airport crew were smiling it was comfortable and food was excellent. Aircraft (B777-200) was good.
439,PVR-MEX Flight AM143 February 18 2013 Boeing 737-700 seat 22A. Flight half full we sat all ready to go in the cabin without air for a good 15 minutes before we were on our way. The aircraft had slim seats which tend to be the new trend with airlines to reduce weight and give a little more leg room. Leg room was OK but comfort of the seat is poor due to the lack of padding giving you some back pain even for a flight of a little over an hour. Drink service was OK staff friendly and attentive. Arrival on time.
440,Best experience I have had flying transatlantic. Flew round trip MCO-DUB 10/22 and returned 10/31. Continuing service to CDG. Very friendly and ever present staff on the transatlantic portion. The seat turned into an almost lay flat bed which provided a sound sleep in both directions. Wines were well chosen and poured frequently. Meals were well presented with a variety of appetizers before and hot breads during dinner. The staff service and the overall cleanliness of the plane convinced me that I had made the right choice for an airline. The connection DUB-CDG was a packed economy flight. For an hour and a half flight it was tolerable. Aer Lingus competes with Ryanair on this route so everything including water is for sale. My choice from now on for transatlantic flights. Clearing customs and immigration in Dublin is a real plus. American customs and immigration are rude and hostile but about what you would expect from them.
441,JFK-DUB EI108 Nov 1st. Another more or less faultless flight with Aer Lingus across the pond. Young cabin crew who were enthusiastic smiling and charismatic. Very attentive to all passengers on a late night flight from New York to Dublin. Pilots again very informative on routing weather and arrival time which is great. Crew apologetic for delay leaving JFK but flight still arrived 55 mins ahead of schedule. Added bonus was the fact that the crew played some great modern music while taxiing to stand after arrival. One minor criticism was the pace of check- in/bag-drop. Great job all round.
442,DUB-ORD and return. Both flights on Airbus 330-300. Seating seemed tight in both width and legroom compared with other airlines we have used. We booked their so called Choice seats for which we paid extra but there is no real advantage to this other than you get to board with business class. Aer Lingus offers the facility to pre-order better quality meals and I would definitely recommend doing this. Much better than the normal economy offer and you get free wine. The service on the flight out was exemplary. They had lost my wife's pre-booked meal but rustled her up a business class meal and gave us extra wine to compensate. Film choice is not nearly as good as we have experienced on Far East airlines and very annoyingly they truncated the film service towards the end of the flight to show a video for their pet charity which they had already screened at the start of the flight. Big bonus being able to clear US customs in Dublin so arrive at Chicago as domestic passengers. On the flight back they woke us up three hours after serving dinner for a cheese roll at 3.30am Suggest they abandon this idea and let people sleep a bit longer. Overall it was as good as economy gets on European airlines although not anything like as good as the likes of Singapore and Malaysia. Would fly with them again.
443,DUB-DUS-DUB. Outbound flight light load had breakfast not bad value and quite tasty. Remote stand in DUS but efficient transfer via bus so no complaints. So return last night full flight (215 people). Departure at 9.20pm. At about 8.30 at gate announcement made asking everyone to go downstairs collect bags and exit for bus transfer to Cologne where our aircraft was! Turns out curfew at Dussledorf means no jet aircraft after 10pm. Inbound flight was delayed which would have prevented a departure prior to 10 resulting in an overnight. All handled pretty well to the point that obviously this was not the first time this happened! Bit of a pain back through security etc in Cologne and people who had bought duty free in Dussledorf had some issues. Ended up arriving in Dublin at 1am about 3 hrs late. Flight itself fine. My only comment is on one attendant. Few German lads in row opposite me having a few drinks. A bit spirited but nothing to bother anyone. In fact the young attendant on board had a few laughs with them chatting about best pubs to go to in Dublin. Then as other attendant passing they were a bit loud and I noticed her giving them a hard stare. I travel a lot and know when people are behaving in a poor manner but not in this case. She had a furious look the whole trip. Ok so like the rest of us on a Friday night not impressed running so late but we were all in the same boat and I thought the passengers were remarkably stoic and took it all on the chin.
444,"PRG-SVO-BKK. A smooth flight to SVO on a newish A320. Seats are proper business class seats (2-2 config) but they do look and feel a bit outdated already. Nevertheless still comfortable and there's plenty of space. Cabin crew were polite and effective. The main (and only) complaint on this flight was the quality of food. The main dish was pretty much inedible but the choice of wines and drinks was good. Transfer in Moscow was quick and easy. No delays at security screening/passport control. Terminal F is bad in comparison to terminals D and E. The Classic or the ""First class"" lounge is old crowded and all in all unpleasant. Boarding the BKK flight was chaotic. Even if priority was given to business passengers there was no real control as to who was boarding first. Nevertheless managed to be one of the first ones onboard. Once onboard was shown to my seat and offered the pre-flight drink by a friendly cabin crew member. Aircraft was a brand new 777-300ER with a new cabin design throughout the aircraft. Business class seats (2-2-2 config) found these seats very comfortable and the atmosphere of the cabin modern and pleasant. Cabin crew professional friendly and attentive. A 3 course dinner was served and the quality of the food was much better. Plenty of drinks offered. IFE system with proper wide screens offers sufficient amount of entertainment apart from the choice in music. All in all a very positive experience with Aeroflot. Would certainly fly Aeroflot again."
445,I took Aeroflot SU2387 from ARN to SVO on 26 Mar and SU013 from LED to SVO on 31 Mar and I was pleasantly surprised with the cabin attendants who were well groomed courteous and able to communicate in standard English. The LED-SVO leg even had the bonus of the purser giving a brief of what one could see or do in Moscow. The meal services on both legs were conducted at lightning speed which I initially found worrisome as I was only halfway through my ARN-SVO meal when I saw the crew collecting the trays four rows away but I did see that the mainly Russian and Swedish passengers were already done eating so it was probably my pace that was the issue. For the prices I paid Aeroflot delivered exceptional value. I expected a Soviet relic but I experienced efficiency and service at its Russian best.
446,Istanbul-Sharjah-Delhi. Excellent experience and fare lower than on standard airlines. Well- designed and clear website. Clean planes and polite crew. Food available for purchase of board at very reasonable rate and of good quality.
447,Staff at Heathrow Airport not very helpful. Manager quite ignorant to people's needs. Cabin crew quite the opposite very polite and always smiling. A shame how one can spoil it for the other. If you have excess luggage I personally think they over charge. They charge Â£15.00 per kilo and believe me you cannot get away with it.
448,LHR-ATH return - A320 outbound A321 return. Excellent service and a good fare. Both aircraft's clean and comfortable with several rounds of drinks (wine tea coffee). Food good. Flights on time or ahead of schedule.
449,ATH-LHR A320. Flight arrived in London early but luggage delivery so slow in T1 it didn't make any difference. Decent service food horrible as always. New and clean plane. Decent movie onboard.
450,I loved flying Aegean Air from Rome to Athens in May 2011. Check in was a breeze. The food was warm and good even had dessert. Staff was courteous and helpful. After flying EasyJet for most parts of my 2 week European backpacking trip flying Aegean was a treat.
451,"Flight from Shymkent to Kuala Lumpur via Almaty and back in April. On vacation we were hospitalized with fever and skipped our flight home. Air Astana appreciated our position and changed dates for our unreturnable tickets without charge, so we could come home later. Great thanks for help, now we are your loyal clients."
452,My flight from Sydney to SÃ£o Paulo was cancelled and they called me to say they were having problems and if they could change my itinerary. They arranged everything for me with Emirates. My flight back to Australia was ok no delay. The food isn't good. No TVs but it is not a problem if you have magazines and books. The seats are not comfortable. The price is good however staff don't speak English very well. The check-in was very slow it took nearly 2 hours. Recommended if you to want save money.
453,Feb 8 2013 flight AM192 MEX-PVR Embraer 170. My first time on this type of aircraft. I liked the large windows and larger seats. One thing though leather seats tend to have you slide down and slouch. Flight was on time staff friendly bags delivered by the time I had deplaned.
454,"Dublin - New York Oct 26th: Early start for flight to NYC on EI105 ""St. Patrick"". Booked flight 6mts in advance for a hugely competitive Â£440 return. Major plus is clearing U.S. Immigration and Customs at T2 and hassle-free seamless arrival at T5 at JFK. Aircraft spotlessly clean new and unworn. Entered fleet in 2010 only. PTV screens were great with excellent documentaries although choice of good movies limited. Staff professional and efficient. Pilot is provided plenty of weather and routing information. Chose the pre-ordered chicken meal which I would highly recommend doing. Head and shoulders above the standard economy meal. Overall an excellent flight and experience. Could in no way fault."
455,Dublin to Frankfurt. Departed a little late but arrived in time. Comfortable flight (not full). Good and pleasant service from the cabin crew. Decent selection of food and drinks for sale. Overall cannot fault it and the price was very reasonable.
456,"EI775 Agadir - Dublin 12th October. Normally full of praise for Aer Lingus there seems to a general problem with inflight catering with Aer Lingus lately. They heavily advertise their new ""pre-booked meal service"" this is the 2nd time in 5 weeks that the meals were never loaded? Why offer something you can't provide food for purchase seems to always run out crew were ok but hassled not the normal friendly crew. Swissport the ground handlers are a disaster."
457,DUB to MAN one way. Very early flight but crew very friendly and helpful. Left on time but slight delay landing in Manchester due to fog. Pilot informative about weather throughout the flight. Flight very smooth with comfortable seating. Fly often with Aer Lingus and would highly recommend.
458,PVG-SVO-BEG. After flying in economy first time I decided to try out Aeroflot business as it was pretty cheap. Staff English pretty decent food good for my taste plenty of alcohol. Overall money spent well. SVO-BKK business class again I was happy with the level of service and comfort for the amount of money spent on a ticket. Shall use Aeroflot in future.
459,HAN-SVO-VIE return. All flights on time. Separate check-in for business class disturbed by allowing economy class pax using the biz-class check-in counter. However correct check in though a bit stressful as the airport and particularly the flight to Moscow was crowded. Flight HAN-SVO overbooked and roughly 20 of 34 seats in business were economy pax being upgraded to business. FA managed to accommodate all additional pax. Access to lounges in HAN SVO and VIE went smoothly. Invitation cards issues at check in and at transfer desk in SVO. In SVO you are free to choose which of 4-5 Aeroflot lounges you want access to. FA staff polite at a first glance a bit too firm and not truly kind. Seats are good. The lie flat on A330-300 is a bit angled but sleep-able. Food present in good quantities and good though not sophisticated. Drinks are good. Champagne/juice offered 2-3 times at take-off. Disappointment is that after departure and until you get any drink they go and take orders which complicate things and the serving of the first drinks happens only 1.5-2 hours after departure. No drink wagons everything is brought by hand to individuals. Food is good a bit tasteless 3 options. Refills or modifications are made possible. FA-English skills very poor. Entertainment acceptable but earphones are collected an hour prior to landing. Altogether a bit rough and robust service but no major faults apart for very slow 1st service on board. Good value for money if you buy discounted biz- class. 3 of 4 flights on time only the last flight was delayed due to snowstorm in Moscow.
460,PEK-FCO return economy class. The PEK-SVO/SVO-PEK legs were served through old planes no IFE uncomfortable seats ok food. Transit through Sheremetyevo Airport was a bit of a nightmare: it took a long time and staff was not friendly and helpful. The SVO-FCO/FCO-SVO were much better as planes were newer IFE available and staff friendlier.
461,Heathrow to Larnaca return in October 2011. Excellent in every respect - new clean aircraft relaxed and attentive service.
462,LHR - Mykonos rtn via Athens both ways. 30 minute delay outbound from LHR meant connection was very tight in Athens. Cabin crew provided reassurance to anxious passengers (one crew member saying 'Aegean Airlines cares for its passengers don't worry) and at Athens those of us with tight connections were met by a lady who competently and at very high speed escorted us through what is a complex connecting arrangement. No delays on the return service and we landed 15 minutes early at LHR. Service onboard was good with a hot meal and a free bar. On the way from LHR to ATH we had a new A321 aircraft with in flight entertainment (main screen). Otherwise flights were on a mix of A319 and A320 of varying ages. Thoroughly enjoyed my flights with them the crew work hard and seem proud of their airline.
463,26 April Tashkent-Almaty flight KS128 and 5th May Almaty-Tashkent flight KS127. Embraer 160 from Tashkent-Almaty-Tashkent. Excellent service on Board. It was at a high level starting from check-in to landing. Flight attendants were very neat and friendly also pleased with the print media. Even given candy during takeoff and landing as well as a pillow which were very nice.
464,Flight from London on time 767 aircraft with new interior. clean and well presented crew efficient and helpful Food and alcohol selection great seat very comfortable and inflight entertainment console worked well. Arrived on time and fresh. This is a great connection for Kazakhstan.
465,Astana-Istanbul-Astana on March 16-18 2015. It was one of my best flight experiences starting from check-in inflight meal offering and friendly approach of flight attendants. It was worth every cent I paid.
466,Flew twice on domestic flights in Argentina and despite all the bad reviews these flights were excellent on time and without any issues. One was operated by Austral on a new airplane which had comfortable seats with IFE in back seat. I may have been lucky but I can recommend them for domestic flights.
467,Buenos Aires to Salta to Iguazu. Both flights were fine. Punctual efficient and a decent snack. Both were on Embraer 190 operated by Austral and the second craft was new - excellent seats and seat-back IFE with personal headsets on a flight of less than 2 hours.
468,MTY-MEX-PVG-MEX-MTY. Departed MTY Terminal B very nice fast check in. Boarded a brand new 737-800 with IFE in Biz and coach classes. In MEX went to the AM lounge - its excellent. Boarded (777-200ER) sat in Premier Class all the way to PVG. It has a tech stop over TIJ which turned out not so bad you don't even get off the plane at TIJ just crew changes and on we went to Shanghai. It was a 14.45 min flight but sleeping eating movies and great crews made my flight amazing!
469,Flew from Miami to Cabo through Mexico City. I was very hesitant but chose to do so as I was taking 5 people with me and it was $250.00 cheaper pp to fly Aeromexico than the other domestic airlines. My experience turned out to be a very pleasant one. Other than legroom being a little tight in economy on 2 of the 4 flights planes were clean on time staff very pleasant and flight attendants dressed well. Mexico City airport was very easy to manage. My experience was just as good if not better than any other domestic airline.
470,Flew AeroMexico for the first time in economy class from JFK to Cancun return. Aside from the legroom or lack of I can't make any negative comments. We were given a pretty good breakfast half hour into the flight nice hot coffee and flight attendents made multiple beverage runs throughout the 3.5hr flt. The return was pretty much the same except it was a dinner flight and they offered complimentary alcohol. I'd say AeroMexico is a much better airline to travel to Mexico in economy class then US carriers.
471,We flew Boston to Dublin and back. Flight 136 Sep 15 2013. Flight 137 Sep 27 2013. Excellent flights excellent crew! Aer Lingus will be our airline for overseas travel. Highly recommended.
472,MAN-MCO Business Class Sep 2013. One cannot praise Aer Lingus enough the flights were excellent as were the meals on board. Aircraft's were spotlessly clean and good service from start to finish. The only draw back was that we could not find lounge at MCO as it was United's in another part of airport.
473,LAX-SVO: Round-trip: Feb 6-12 2013. Frankly not so bad considering the price. Pros: Relatively comfortable. Direct flight. Cons: boarding is badly organized especially in SVO cheap wine in tetrapaks only paper glasses food choices are limited to two items.
474,AMS-SVO-HKG. First experience with a Russian airline. Aircraft new A320 and A330 reasonably on time. SVO terminal F horrible more like a busy bus terminal. Seat comfortable PTV with a limited choice. Staff attitude OK (didn't really expect too much in this part of the world). Would fly them again as they offer a decent product for a low cost.
475,LHR-ATH-LHR Business Class. Flight was comfortable with reasonably good service. On return trip breakfast was extremely good - much better than the lunch on the outward leg. No significant delays even though Greek ATC was working to rule.
476,Athens-Chios-Athens Economy. Despite this being only a 20 minute flight it's operated by an A320. Very few passengers on it on outward leg but quite busy on return with large number of pax transiting Athens en route to US and Canada having been back home for summer. Service was okay - early morning flight so we were offered coffee/ soft drink and chocolate croissant. Check in at Athens was very efficient. Chios is the smallest airport I have experienced but everything went very smoothly - even in a very cramped check in area there was no long delay getting luggage checked in and boarding cards issued.
477,Staff excellent customer service oriented meals are good and the planes are new. The seats are comfortable and lounge in Athens has a smoking area that is not packed.
478,I recently flew return from BKK to ALA. It was the first time I've flown Air Astana and I have to say that I was delighted with the attentive anticipatory levels of service I received. The plane itself looked brand new the business class cabin was spotless and a true delight to sit in. While the inflight entertainment was not as extensive as higher profile airlines this wasn't an issue for me. The dining experience was excellent quality varied food presented fantastically. The service and the environment along with the punctuality made this an excellent first experience of an airline that is clearly having an effect in the region.
479,12/2/15 KS942/952 London - Almaty. 21/2/15 KS601/941 Almaty - London. You really get the feeling with Air Astana that the company is genuinely striving for improvement all the time. Staff are extremely courteous and helpful planes are really clean flights generally arrive on time. The new economy sleeper is a winning option for people who dread the loss of a nights sleep but cannot bring themselves to fork out the full business class fare. I travelled with my four children and we all thought economy sleeper was brilliant. At least a chance of sleep much more space quieter cabin and better food that in economy.
480,MEX-MIA on a Boeing 737-800. Full flight and despite this the airline manages to board everyone very quickly. The crew of Aeromexico have a very high Uniform standard and are very professional. On this 2.5 hour flight I was offered a complete breakfast drinks including alcoholic drinks newspapers and headphones. Their Hub in Mexico City is definitely the best terminal in North America.
481,Flew Cork-Nice return recently. Outward flight was fine and on time. Food on flight was quite poor and bad value. Aer Lingus seemed to have changed caterers. Return flight was a shambles. All passengers were boarded on time and the pilot announced that all was ready with just some paperwork to complete which would take just a few minutes. Time passed slowly and the minutes mounted up. After about 15 minutes the pilot said that there was a slight problem and he was waiting for an engineer to sort things out. The engineers duly arrived and were to be seen examining so instruments in the cockpit. They left and returned a number of times and the cabin crew did their best to reassure the passengers and were unable to begin catering of any sort because of customs regulations. After about and hour a supervisor went to the cockpit and some more examining of instruments continued. The pilot said at this stage that there was a fuel gauge problem and after about another 15 mins he announced that the problem had been satisfactorily solved. So one and a half hours late we departed.
482,MAN-SNN SNN-JFK JFK-DUB DUB-MAN. Got a great deal on the ticket price very comfortable A330 planes on the long haul segments with seat-back IFE with a great selection of movies and music very helpful and friendly crew and decent food/drink selection. All sectors were on time and transfers at SNN and DUB were fast and easy. In addition to the excellent all round service there are two major advantages to using Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel: Pre-clearance is available for all USA bound flights out of SNN and I believe selected flights out of DUB hence you arrive as a domestic passenger in the USA and walk straight out of the airport - the pre-clearance facilities in Shannon at least have virtually no queues and you can get through them in a matter of minutes so I suspect that even accounting for the layover time it is as quick as flying directly. Secondly Aer Lingus use T5 at JFK which is a marvellous Terminal loads of space seats eating and drinking options and really fast efficient (and surprisingly friendly) security - I believe that T5 is exception at JFK in this regard. All in all I would very highly recommend Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel to anyone.
483,IST-SVO-IST. Check-in at IST was total chaos plane arrived on time at SVO and on the return the plane left on time from SVO. Check-in at SVO was brilliant no chaos we waited for about 1 minute. Both inflight to and from SVO food was awful. Quite confusing to see that complimentary drinks are served in advance of meal. Attendants not smiling but are very professional and try to help as much as they can. Plane was an Airbus albeit the plane on the online sales was shown as IL96 Turbo. Plane didn't look very clean. A great deal in means of price but don't expect much!
484,FRA-SVO-HAV in Dec 2012. FRA check-in was chaos 2 counters were very slow moving. SVO connecting was very smooth - it took less than 10 mins for passport check and security check. SVO-HAV 13 hours flight by A330. Economy class first 4 row of IFE didn't work. Seat (12D) pitch was wider than 52 inches. I am 184cm and it was enough to stretch my legs. This is more important than IFE for me. Every hour a drink and snack service by cart. Crews never smiled but worked well.
485,Return Madrid - St Petersburg via Moscow. Absolutely happy with the service (especially taking into account the price as it was one of the cheapest options). All flights on time efficient boarding procedures nice good quality meals. The crew is attentive and friendly (we flew Aeroflot in December 2011 and could see a big improvement in the quality of the service over the year). New aircraft and comfy seats.
486,I flew 4 flights with them over the summer and everyone of them was delayed. I am aware there are air traffic control restrictions so may not be the airlines fault. However I feel they are crafty as we were just getting up to a 3 hour delay when they boarded us only to sit on the plane for ages so they would not have to pay any compensation. On the plus side the fleet is modern and new. On all but one of the flights the cabin crew were helpful smart and smiling. I found the food to be adequate although no choice. You can check in online 48 hours before the flight and also book emergency row seats for no extra charge.
487,I have often flown Aegean and I always look forward to. Nice service only bad thing - occasionally you book with Aegean and end up having a return flight or a second leg with an inferior company. Make sure you check what connections and return flights are involved.
488,Flight KC929 20 February. Was an overnight flight. Flight left on time and cabin crew were extremely thoughtful. Placed blanket over me while sleeping and when woke even though food service had finished and on way to landing - they found an apple to give me. Was a great experience and very impressed by cabin crew attitude.
489,Flight KC930 24 February. Return trip from Hong Kong in mid February. Plane was very delayed but informed. Could in my view been done earlier but was nice to be told a couple of hours in advance. Trip itself was pleasant. Good inflight entertainment and again the inflight crew did an excellent job and were responsive to needs. Food could be improved as compared to other airlines traveled but do note it is economy class.
490,I found this routing from HK-Almaty very convenient and have done it a couple of times now. Direct flight airport close to city and city close to ski fields. Great value for money. Well maintained aircraft good attention to service - what more do you need.
491,ALA-TSE. B757-200 not new AC but fully refurbished to perfection. Clean and inviting. Crew very well groomed wonderful IFE tasty hot snack on this 80 min flight. Temp however was very high in the cabin and my req to lower it a bit were not fulfilled. I started to feel ill and asked for ice to cool my head crew showed no empathy or care. I was glad it was a short flight.
492,Auckland-Buenos Aires return on A340. Both flights were delayed no reason was given as to why; communication would have been appreciated. There was a single screen for entertainment but no headphones were passed out during one flight until the movie had run! The movies were old. The food was decidedly average. The plane fittings appeared old - my seat bottom was entirely loose from its frame and two of the bathroom doors I used wouldn't close properly. The toilets were not serviced at all during the long 12 hours flights so they were pretty horrible by the end. The crew were friendly and bilingual but once meals were served they did not really appears. I wouldn't seek to fly with this airline again unless there were no other options. I had an internal flight in Argentina on LAN Chile and they appeared to be a more polished act.
493,GRU-MEX-LAX roundtrip. GRU-MEX on B777-200 comfortable aircraft good legroom individual but limited IFE. Offered complimentary alcoholic beverages but meals were inedible. MEX-LAX on B737-700 fair legroom. Aeromexico has an odd confusing boarding procedure - instead of using boarding groups based on seat rows just like most of airlines they call passengers by seat type: window middle or aisle. That means if you are travelling with relatives or acquaintances boarding will have to be individual. If you consider connecting through Mexico City be aware that no matter the destination is you will have to go through immigration and customs. So think twice if your final destination is the US.
494,Had a wonderful experience flying Aer Lingus from Boston to Dublin and from Dublin to Chicago. Both trips were effortless and the customer service was top notch. Everyone was friendly and helpful. I also flew this airline between Dublin and Paris and had a positive experience as well.
495,Just completed a LHR to DUB round trip on flexi tickets which is the nearest you can get to Business class on Aer Lingus. Loved the lounges at both ends uncrowded and stylish. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Great in flight magazine. The new Terminal 2 at DUB is a delight. But the aircraft's are very cramped the flight out was completely full and I felt very trapped even being on the front row. The lack of proper inflight catering brings the on board service down combined with the cramped seat pitch and no free on board catering creates a no fills feel. Even if you pay and pre order a meal on a flexi ticket you lose it if you change your time. Surely modern IT could cope with re-assigning it.
496,Dublin - Malaga return. Outbound on 05/09/13 on A330. All aspects of this flight was excellent. Flight on time seats were comfortable and staff excellent. Only gripe was delay in getting baggage in Malaga airport. Return on 17/09/13 on A320. Seats were a bit hard but ok for a 3 hour flight. Staff again friendly and helpful and flight on time. Baggage on carousel on arrival. Aer Lingus is definitely my preferred carrier out of Ireland.
497,Flew today Moscow SVO to Amsterdam. Easy check in easy to find the lounge which offered basic refreshments. The big surprise was our flight offered champagne or OJ as we sat down flight crew very friendly short delay as wings were de-iced and the purser took our drink orders and meal preferences at that time. The seats were comfy the portable digital handheld entertainment worked well and easily. On time. We also got a small toiletries bag and a luggage tag. I have no complaints and would highly recommend in the future.
498,ATH-SVO-VNO and what a pleasant surprise it was. ATH-SVO a well maintained A320 almost fully packed with very good pitch and a very friendly crew. Very nice uniforms. Tasteful food and choices available. Refreshments for free with refills alcohol at a charge. Arrival in SVO but no jetway available it was snowing so the stairs became a bit tricky. SVO-VNO on a Sukhoi Superjet. Seats a bit hard but it was only a 75 minutes flight. Dinner was served. Friendly crew. 15 minutes delay but with this kind of weather it was nothing.
499,LHR-ATH-LHR. Super Flight great crew I was even offered a chance to see the captain. Great movie and lovely food good choice of duty free items lounge was comfortable.
500,LHR-ATH-JMK. Bags were transferred seamlessly at Athens which was my main concern. LHR-ATH flight was smooth cabin lighting could have been dimmed with one meal/trolley service for the flight food was served quickly however and the cabin crew were extremely friendly. ATH-JMK was the quickest flight I've ever done and by the time they handed out the drinks they were grabbing them back for landing. Overall a pleasant flying experience helped by the open selection on booking seats (I got exit rows) and the ability to check in 48 hrs before. My one criticism is when doing cabin announcements they speak English so quickly that you do not always hear/understand what is being said.
501,CDG-RUN return. Air Austral is the airline of RÃ©union Island owned by the local public authorities. On the good side food is average but not too bad particularly main dishes. FA are smiling and very attentive ground staff really nice. Boarding was very well organised. A small travel kit is provided with socks. Pillows are wide. Cabin looks fine although a bit ageing in Y. New livery on the planes is really great. On the downside choice of films on the IFE is surprisingly limited and most French films - and seats are really narrow because of 3-4-3 configuration on B777 particularly exit seats. All in all I find its service to be slightly better than AF and Air Mauritius on this area.
502,Sydney-Reunion-CDG return May/June 2012. After reading mixed reviews here we were a little apprehensive at first but booked anyway because of price and also short stop over times. Staff were friendly upon initial check in blocking the seat next to us so we had more room. Actually the only flight we had to sit next to someone else was Reunion-CDG. Entertainment selection was great and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Food was tasty and very sufficient. And the care packs with socks ear plugs sleep mask and headphones were a nice touch. On return flight Reunion-Sydney the plane was virtually empty so we had a row of seats each as did most other passengers in the cabin. Again staff were very attentive constantly offering drinks throughout the flight. All in all we had an extremely pleasant experience and have no hesitation flying with them again. Have recommended Air Austral and will continue to.
503,IST-TSE-BKK (and back) on A321 and B767 first airplane saws its years the other one is great new and comfortable. The service from the staff was great. Very personalized friendly and they spoke fluent English. There was not IFE on A321 but 2 movies were on drop down screens. Excellent IFE on B767 with HD screens and good variety of movies TV series games. Food was very tasty and plenty of alcoholic drinks beverages coffee/tea. They offer newspapers and amenities kits. Great airline to fly with TSE airport small but new and clean.
504,I flew to San Jose Costa Rica from SFO via Mexico City. The first leg was extremely hot as the AC was turned off. However the subsequent legs were good. Beer was free and so were the meals. Overall the service was much better than American domestic airlines.
505,My husband and I were delayed in Guadalajara by 1.25 hours because of engine problems which meant we would miss our connection in Puerta Vallarta to Calgary with WestJet. Aeromexico ground staff in Guad made it possible for us to catch our connecting flight. We were met in P.V. on the tarmac and were personally escorted through the airport rushed through immigration phone calls were made to ensure that our luggage had been transferred and we made it onto the WestJet flight with only 5 minutes to spare. We had a hotel and rental car booked and paid for in Calgary so we had to get there and we did.
506,Excellent flight on Aer Lingus from BOS-CDG clean comfortable aircraft staffed by the best cabin attendants on all segments. Very easy connections at DUB. Aer Lingus is my transatlantic airline of choice.
507,Recently flew from Boston to Shannon (EI-134) on board a very comforting Airbus A330 wide body. On boarding the aircraft at Boston Logan Airport for our flight we were greeted by a very welcoming flight crew. The aircraft was well maintained and very clean. As soon as we departed Boston beverage service was served. Complimentary soft drinks served but alcohol was not free which is ok. Dinner service began about 1 hour after departing and we were served chicken or beef. The meal service was delicious. Flight crew came around during dinner service with more beverages and water. More food available if we desired. Entertainment was excellent plenty of choices for movies. I have to say Aer Lingus is a wonderful airline with great service.
508,BHD to LHR. Flight on time flew on a modern A319 cabin crew friendly enough however legroom was practically non existant I literally didn't have room to read a magazine on my lap and actually getting to my (window) seat was tough. Overall pretty average but the lack of reasonable legroom made the flight quite uncomfortable.
509,HAM-SVO-HAM first time with AFL-Business class. Check In at Hamburg very quick. Shared Lounge with acceptable refreshments. Boarding well organized. The big surprise was the C Class cabin. It is a separated cabin with wall and real C Class seats and seat pitch. After seated the FA offered a glass of champagne or orange juice and handed over the lunch menu (3 choices). After take off the purser came and greeted every passenger personally and handed over the portable IFE Digiplayer. Digiplayer offered limited IFE but more than okay for a 3 hrs flight. Lunch was very tasty. Arrival at Moscow Sheremetyevo newest Terminal D. SVO- HAM also at Terminal D - quick Check-In / AFL own lounge without window but offers better quality and quantity of refreshments than Hamburg lounge. Return flight with same great experience. AFL offers an excellence Business class product much better than those established European Airlines.
510,PRG to BKK in business. Great fare so switched my natural BA allegiance. Good food some fun with crew. Entertainment on A330 OK to pass some time. Laughs with crew and seat row ordering my drinks in Russian but everyone appreciated my poor efforts so I never went thirsty. Lounges in SVO are poor and crowded. Nice sandwiches though. Transit change is easy to do. SU are a good alternative to AY for Asia flights. All flights on time and everything felt very safe.
511,I use Aeroflot pretty often on my flights from Vienna to Bangkok Hong Kong and domestic flights in Russia. All flights were on time. Onboard service was great. Comfortable seats and great entertainment plenty of movies music and games. New Airbus A330-300 as well the Airbus 320 very pleasant and comfortable. Overall very good experience great value for money and I strongly recommend it.
512,LHR-ATH-CFU return. Good planes seats and food. All on time. Let down only by the crew who though very glamorous were a bit clueless. On both long legs I attempted to get a second drink - all met with nods and smiles - to no avail. The Business lounge in Athens was good.
513,LHR-LCA return in Economy. Cabin crew were attentive and professional. The food was tasteful and drinks distributed 3 times during the flight. Punctual latest aircraft clean.
514,Professional service. There was a delay of 1 hour from Crete to Athens however we received a voucher for a free domestic flight.
515,"Departed Jorge Newbury Airport (AEP) Buenos Aires to GaleÃ£o-(GIG) Rio de Janeiro. Flight number AR 2252- 22 August 2012. Embraer 190 aircraft. Arrived at the airport in time for a 9.50am departure. There were many announcements in Spanish but very few in English until English speaking passengers enquired at departure gates. Flight was 1 hour late with no explanation given. Flight itself was fantastic however cabin crew were less than friendly and did not even check our boarding pass to direct us to our assigned seat as we boarded. Inflight ""snack"" was some sort of carrot cake caramel filled biscuit covered in a white chocolate substance with a caramel sweet."
516,Excellent trip between New Caledonia and St Denis of La Reunion. Onward and return on a Boeing 747 with good comfort on seats. Individual screens. Excellent service and good meals. The pitch was just too little for me and that's why I just give 9 and not 10.
517,Mauritius to Reunion return. Onward flight was on a Boeing 737-800 with only a 20% load so we had enough space during that 20 mins flight. Service was a cookie and juice which was nice. Return flight was on a ATR 72 aircraft with the same service. Crew was friendly and helpful. Flights and bags where on time. Would fly them again even ticket price is quite high.
518,In the last year I have flown Air Astana on 14 different legs now (ALA-SGN ALA-BKK-SGN ALA-ICH and ALA-DEL). During the past the service has been getting better and better. Some irritants during flights such as flight attendants bumping in to your elbows (aisle seats) or waking you up for meals have disappeared. Meals have got better. The old 757 interiors are being renovated. Long flights know offer personal entertainment systems for each person in Economy. All the ticket prices have been reasonable though it is hard to build up miles with Air Astana's Nomad Club. That is one complaint I have with Air Astana. With most airlines I would have gotten free upgrades by now. Many of Air Astana's low fares exclude you from accumulating frequent flier miles. I hope this changes in the future. Overall I say Air Astana is a good carrier to choose nowadays.
519,I took six flights over two weeks London-Astana Astana-Almaty and Almaty to Tashkent and all of them were very good and I was impressed with the staff quality of food and video/TV system. The flight between Astana and London both ways wasn't very busy and the planes were very modern and well maintained. It was a pleasure and relaxing to fly with them.
520,LAX-MEX-GRU in Business. Very fast check-in at LAX however the lounge wasn't open which was awkward. Flight to MEX was comfortable however the flight attendant couldn't be bothered to do anything with the meal and the omelette was served cold. Club Premier lounge in DF was great with food wine and showers. Flight to Sao Paulo was average food was great however I didn't think the seat was as comfortable as LAN. All in all decent - much better than an American airline to S America.
521,Excellent fast and efficient. Flew JFK-MEX on their red-eye flight. Did Web check-in and made a quick baggage drop. Movie and two TV episodes as inflight entertainment. A nice sandwich for midnight snack/dinner. Early Departure and early arrival to MEX. Bags were already waiting in carrousel after arrival.
522,"MEX-MAD 777 in Business Class! Fast and efficient check-in quick security checkpoint crossing and amazing VIP Lounge! Efficient Priority boarding and onboard nice big lie flat ""pod"" seats! Very good IFE and delicious food with nice staff. Nice quiet smooth flight with lots of entertainment."
523,Aug 22nd 2013 Flight EI0105 DUB to JFK. I have to say that I am a frequent flyer with Aer Lingus over the years and I have seen a steady deterioration in the customer service of the airline attendants. I feel that re-education in customer service would benefit many employees of Aer Lingus. Quite frankly food was almost thrown at us when served no smiles and no manners! My friend is a gold circle member and did not accept the dinner served he asked for cheese and crackers and was told there was none.
524,I flew from Manchester to Dublin (MAN-DUB) and Dublin to Manchester (DUB-MAN) with Aer Lingus. I did not experience any problems. The cabin crew and gate staff seemed okay but the onboard food and drink was a little overpriced. Overall I was quite satisfied with the service delivered by Aer Lingus for my short flight to Dublin and back I would travel with Aer Lingus again.
525,Los Angeles to Moscow and back every year. Direct flight. The airline has improved tremendously in the last 10 years. Now I find it adequate and on par with any of the lower price international carriers. Bring your own entertainment and snacks though.
526,PEK-SVO-TXL business class. PEK-SVO in A330-300. New seats comfortable but not lie flat. Cabin was very clean and modern. Staff efficient but not overly friendly - which is to be expected. Head FA did ask me how I should be addressed and stuck to that preference. Food was fair and there was certainly plenty (6 courses). Drink selection good. AVOD was average - not the greatest selection but enough to please. Transfer at SVO was very easy. Lounge at SVO was average - ok food drinks and good wifi. SVO-TXL on an A320. Immaculate condition of plane and the staff/inflight meals were excellent for a 2.5 hour flights. FAs handed out portable players for flight which is great. Very impressive short-haul service. Overall an excellent value for money considering most of the other carriers were charging more for an economy seat.
527,"Moscow - Havana - Moscow. Both flights on time luggage reached the destination. Clean new Airbus A330 pillow and blanket provided. Inflight entertainment system very good however mine was broken after 4 hours on flight to Havana. Restarting the system helped but then the handset stopped working as well so the system was useless. Cabin crew polite and helpful. Big minus for the food which was awful. Beverages were good although there was no alcohol on this route. Very difficult to understand the ""Russian"" English during the announcements. My rating of the flights reflects very much the impact of poor food (which is important during the 12 hrs flight) the rest was very good especially the price."
528,Athens - Heathrow route. Arrived at terminal 1 30mins late due to air traffic. Had another 2.5 hrs to collect baggage and check in at terminal 5 for a domestic flight on BA. A fast walk to the baggage claim took about 20mins and thereafter waited another 30mins for the baggage to arrive. By the time someone accepted us at one of the many empty counters it was already too late. We missed our connection I strongly recommend allowing at least 4 hrs to connect from terminal 1 to 5. The airline itself is very good. Clean and new A321 friendly flight crew and free drinks onboard meal was average.
529,NOU-RUN-MRS return. The overall service and meals were beyond expectations for a French airline crews were polite professional and present throughout the cabin. All flights with brand new B773 are pleasant with PTV's and conformable seats. The only flight with B772 was on the MRS-RUN leg and it was a shame because no PTV on this ageing aircraft. However the transit area in Saint Denis La RÃ©union airport definitely needs to be revamped there is nothing Air Austral can do about it but I hope this will be modernised shortly.
530,MRU-RUN-SYD-NOU return. High level of service across the board. No difference between flying on an ATR 72-500 and a B777-300. The crew were well groomed polite and efficient. Great Creole cuisine with a French savoir fare. Hot meals for the main services and good open sandwiches in between. On Demand Entertainment System worked well with plenty of choices. International magazines available. Clean lavatories.
531,SYD-CDG return. I have travelled to Europe several times and never look forward to it. Booking and check-in no problem staff and service was very good. The addition of a TGV ticket to get me closer to my destination was much appreciated and connection was easy. My only quibble was a limited entertainment selection.
532,Bangkok-Almaty on 5 Oct 2014 KC932 and return Almaty-Bangkok on 12 Oct 2014 KC931. Check-in staff were friendly and speak good English. The B757 used was clean and have a new look about it. The IFE was reasonably good with offerings of some of the latest films. The cabin crew was friendly helpful and attentive. The overnight flight from Almaty to Bangkok took off at around 1 am. About two hours into the flight a full meal was served. Before landing in Bangkok at around 8.45 a.m. no breakfast was served. For a flight like this suggest that two light meals be served ??one shortly after take-off and breakfast before landing. Overall it was a pleasant experience flying with Air Astana.
533,Heathrow to Almaty return via Astana in Business Class. This was the first time that we had flown Air Astana and we were generally pretty impressed. Not quite up to the standard of the top Airlines but worth their 4 star Skytrax status. Outbound the meal was one of the best I've experienced in the air; with multiple courses presented separately and the food options varied and delicious. Inbound was another matter however with tasteless cold fish chicken that was a bit dry and less attractive options. Maybe the Caterer in Astana isn't as good as in London. Service both ways however was excellent with pre take-off drinks offered boiled sweets hot face towels drinks and nuts or canapÃ©s and very attentive staff. The seats were pretty comfy and whilst not fully flat (hopefully their Dreamliners on order will have fully flat seats in Business) they still had very decent recline and allowed for some sleep. (we were on a 757 for all sectors so if you get this aircraft type or a 767 on Domestic sectors then you're doing pretty well in Business Class for such a short flight - nothing like the terrible Business Class European Airlines offer on short haul flights). The Etihad Lounge at Heathrow was excellent; and it's very quiet at the time that Air Astana fly as there are no Etihad flights at this time however the Lounge in the Domestic Terminal at Almaty is really an embarrassment (small pokey room no natural light small snack counter charging for everything right down to a cup of tea!). Air Astana hand out tablets in Business Class as there are no seat back TV's. We found that we could hardly hear through the headphones on the way out but this was much better on the way back. The Moving Map however wasn't working on the way back and since the tablets aren't connected to the flight systems at all we had no idea where we were or how long until arrival for the whole flight. (even Economy Class presumably can access this info). Other minor irritations were the same 2 songs played continuously on loop when the aircraft is on the ground and the lovely new anti jet lag ceiling lighting system being inexplicably put through it's paces for the first few hours of the flight jumping between colours every few seconds. Terminal 4 at Heathrow was relatively quiet at the times Air Astana flew which made for a pleasant experience; and I can recommend Terminal 4 Long Stay Parking which is actually just across the main road from the Terminal - no more than 5 minutes in the shuttle bus! Overall we enjoyed our experience with Air Astana perhaps more so than we were expecting and given that they are often keenly priced I would recommend them.
534,Moscow - Astana - Almaty - Bangkok. Two of the three sectors were very late at night or early morning and I chose sleep rather than food. It seemed a little strange serving dinner at about 2.00am! It would be better to offer breakfast when flights depart after 11.30 at night. Cabin crew were good and friendly (all seemed to speak good English) and I was allowed to take some items from the dinner menu prior to landing in Bangkok. The Astana - Almaty meal was good and the quantities perfectly adequate. Check in for all flights was quick and easy. I was disappointed that there is no business lounge in Astana for domestic passengers and the lounge in Almaty is one of the worst I have been in for International Business Class. Luggage was relatively quick off the plane especially in Bangkok. The seating was reasonably comfortable and there was adequate leg room on the flights from Moscow to Almaty. From Almaty to Bangkok it is an angled bed which is reasonably comfortable. IFE is very limited but not so important when you only want to sleep on the flight. I had my own entertainment for the Astana Almaty sector. I continue to fly Air Astana because I think that they are probably the best airline in Eurasia and not bad at keeping to their schedules. The flight from Moscow was delayed for about an hour because of a technical problem. We were promptly advised by the crew of nature of the problem and the likely time needed to fix it.
535,Three flights around Central Asia this last week. FRU-ALA ALA-TSE and TSE-AUH. The FRU-ALA flight was so short they offer a cabin drinks service on the ground. ALA-TSE we were offered a drink and small snack on the B757 overhead screens played a silent sketch show. TSE-AUH was on an A320. A full cabin service was offered. Entertainment was on overhead screen and amenity packs were provided. One movies and a couple TV shows. Leg room was good on all sectors. Staff all spoke English. But check-in always seemed to be chaotic.
536,Buenos Aires-Iguazu Falls return. Two good flights the first on a Boeing 737-700 departed 10 mins early and arrived 15 mins early. Flight service is efficient and cabin crew friendly. The return flight on an MD-88 old but in good condition quiet and comfortable with a friendly and helpful cabin crew with the flight arriving at Aeroparque (AEP) 10 mins early.
537,Great service from Houston to San Pedro Sula in Honduras. Great staff friendly and helpful employees and easy to navigate Terminal 2 in Mexico City and Terminals D and E/F at Houston Intercontinental Airport.
538,Having flown several times with Aer Lingus decided to upgrade to their Business Class cabin from Manchester to Chicago via Dublin. Flight transfer is very easy to navigate in Dublin and on this flight you actually pre-clear US customs in Dublin which is an added bonus. Business Class cabin extremely spacious on the A330 and you are warmly greeted with a nice amenity kit bottled water and champagne. Business Class dining is superb and well worth the upgrade cost in itself with a good choice of entrees. Service includes hot canapÃ©s salad and main cheese and biscuits together with a choice of desserts. You won't go hungry! Cabin crew are attentive and if you require extra refreshments you only have to ask. On return to Dublin you also get continental breakfast. Seats are comfortable and fully adjustable to how you want. There are extra buttons in the arm rest which allows you to individually control different parts of the seat including massage. IFE good although they seemed to have dimmed the brightness of the screen recently so you may need to close the window blind to watch. Overall great experience and have already booked Business Class for my next trip to Boston in October.
539,Have flown Aer Lingus nearly every year. Every flight I have flown is excellent. My most recent was from Milan Linate to Dublin. Flight was on time and all went smooth with luggage etc. All members of staff were helpful and accommodating. Food was good for aeroplane standard and was reasonably priced for being on a plane. Seats and leg space are excellent for economy class. I am once again flying with Aer Lingus in 2 weeks time to Lisbon from the excellent Dublin airport terminal 2. It is a brand new terminal. A great value airline.
540,Mixed business and economy between Manchester and Boston. Staff provided warm professional service - first rate. Experience from check-in to baggage claim was hassle free. Business class food was great - much better than expected. Seat was very comfortable. Really good value for money - certainly will fly with them again.
541,Boarded Aeroflot in Amsterdam for flight to Moscow. Just prior to departing the gate there was a loud commotion in the rear of the plane - it seems we were traveling with a restrained reluctant prisoner. We checked in for our return flight in St. Petersburg for Amsterdam. We requested that we and our luggage be booked thru to Detroit. the attendant assured us that it was done. Upon arrival in Amsterdam we were informed by KLM that they did not receive confirmation of our flight from Amsterdam to Detroit and our seats had been resold. 10 hours later we were aboard a Delta flight on the way home. The issue was not in translation because our request had been relayed by our Russian Tour director and our luggage was booked thru to Detroit. Never again.
542,GVA-SVO-Hanoi NRT-SVO-GVA on Business Class. All planes were clean seats were comfortable food delicious and CAs friendly. I was worried about the transfer at the SVO but it went smoothly at both passport control and security. The SVO terminals which I used ie Terminal D (for long flights) and F (inter European flights) were connected and seemed to be walking through miles of duty free shops with little seats. Will try again in economy class as far as business class is concerned I think their product is at the same level of most European big companies such as KLM and SAS and definitely superior to US carriers.
543,My flight with Aeroflot was really a pleasant one. I flew with them from Amsterdam to Moscow and then on to St Petersburg. Flights departed before the scheduled departure time (all flights) and they landed before the scheduled arrival time. Flights were on their very comfortable Airbus A319 and A320's. The legroom was sufficient for someone of my height (I am 1.81 meters) and the inflight service the food was excellent. Hot meals and alcohol were standard. Cabin crew could have been a bit more cheerful (they didn't smile at all) however they were okay in their politeness and they did their job fine. All in all great flights and I would definitely use them again.
544,I fly around 10 times each year to domestic and European destinations Aegean is my preferred airline for many years now I never had a problem except once where there was a delay of 1hr but they issued a free ticket for me and my wife so I can't complain. Aircraft's always clean stuff friendly and kind. They are a top airline with very good service.
545,ATH-SKG ATH-AXD ATH-JMK. Aegean was quite good: flight attendants were nice food was OK the pilot was good when he explained to us that we would be delayed. The only problem was there wasn't enough room for my bag on the plane so somehow it ended up in security and it took 1/2 hr to find it!
546,SYD to Mauritius. Excellent service and quite comfortable for Economy class. Flight attendants friendly always coming through the cabin with water. Plenty of food provided.
547,Sydney to Noumea Business Class. Fast check in at Sydney Airport they use the Qantas Club which was nice. Boarding delayed for 45minutes due to late arriving aircraft. Business Class roomy and seats comfortable not lie flat but very angled. Crew spoke mainly French and some broken English - but they are a French Airline. Food good service attentive and friendly didn't use the inflight entertainment. Overall not a bad product.
548,SYD-RUN-SEZ. Very attentive crew . Good and adequate food crew offering water . Leather seats comfortable and clean 777-300. More IFE options of movies and other programmes would make it better.
549,Paris to St-Denis (Reunion) in Business Class. Seat is comfortable food is perfect and staff very friendly. In St-Denis lounge we got champagne and apetizers vry nice. Compared to Air France this company is excellent!
550,Bangkok - Almaty - Astana - Novosibirsk. Good quick check and priority lane in busy Bangkok airport luggage slow off in Almaty (did not get priority despite the label). Good crew and food and wine. The 757 from Bangkok to Almaty was a little tired and angled seats should exclude an airline from four star status. The service from Almaty to Astana was good - a full meal served. From Astana to Novosibirsk there were problems in security checks and no fast lane for business class passengers. Staff helped people with tight connections. The domestic Business lounge in Almaty is very poor but the new lounge in Astana was good. I don't think that they deserve their four star rating but they are improving and the English of the Cabin attendants is a lot better than when I first flew with them 10 years ago. I will continue to choose to fly with them in Central Asia.
551,7 Feb from ALA To IST. I travel internationally and domestically frequently. Based on my experience Air Astana is a cut above the rest. As a person who is afraid of flying it is a pleasure to see the rapid modernization of the fleet. I am 193cm tall and leg room is important for me Air Astana usually offers the most. The inflight entertainment is current and changes frequently. Lastly I have found the cabin crew to be very supportive. there was one occasion where I complained about the temperature of the cabin being too hot and the senior flight attendant had a customer complaint book where she recorded my complaint. A great initiative which I have never experienced on other airlines.
552,All in all its OK for a relatively short journey and the food's nice. But you should know this: I travel a number of times a year TSE-FRA and am finding more frequent delays with no information given. The last 3 times there were 40 minute-2 hour delays so beware! Quite a lot of confusion at FRA last time when the plane was 90% filled with a single group of Chinese travelling to Urumqi. Don't take a window seat in winter - the a/c isn't up to it and there's an arctic draft every time. Inflight entertainment not much only overhead screens and reruns of candid camera type stuff and one movie repeated on 6 hour flight. Internally in KZ the prices are ridiculously high because they are the only airline which is up to international standards.
553,Ala-Astana KC 683 back Astana Almaty KC 954 Almaty-Atyrau (Guriev) - KC 889B Atyrau (Guriev) - Almaty KC 890-B. Good service. Perfect take off and landings. Air Astana continues to work on their services and airfleet and I continue to see an ongoing positive development of the company. Some destinations are more expensive than others but generally good value for money.
554,Salta-Puerto Iguazu domestic flight operated by Austral. Flight a Embraer 190 with personal entertainment with TV series and documentaries and some CD's. The entertainment system failed twice but the crew reactivated it quick. Did not expected entertainment on a domestic flight. The crew offered a sandwich with a drink. Good legroom at emergency exit but the normal seats also offered good legroom for this short flight of 1.5 hrs. Departed 2O mins early and landed 40 mins early in Iguazu.
555,Buenos Aires-Madrid. Staff were helpful and friendly. Seats comfortable but there is no onboard entertainment and the plane was old.
556,Ezeiza to Iguazu the plane was quite new a 737-700. No delay at all the flight was nice although no headphones were given. Seats are comfortable for such a small flight 1.45 hrs.
557,I have flown 4 Aeromexico flights in the past 6 months two roundtrips from Mexico City to Chicago and all 4 flights were excellent. One flight left 30 minutes late yet managed to arrive on time. The others left on time and arrived either on time or early. Newspapers and either breakfast or a light lunch onboard. Very friendly flight crews. No problems at all.
558,MEX-MAD. Flight left on time. Aircraft was a Boeing 777-200 in a very good condition. Cabin looked spacious and clean. Seat was ok but sleeping was not easy as it was angled. Moreover the config was 2-3-2 so if sat in the middle and pax next to you are asleep you have to jump over them. AVOD system was reliable. The food was tasty as Aeromexico have started a new collaboration with a group of chefs. There was also an express dining option for those of us who wanted to sleep. The crew were attentive and helpful with high uniform standards. They responded effectively to customer needs and were constantly through the cabin offering drinks and top ups. Two hours before landing breakfast was served. Flight landed in MAD on time. Great flight and exceeded expectations.
559,MAD-MEX Economy class. Check in was a bit disorganized in Terminal 1 of Madrid. Terminal was very busy due to the summer holidays no sitting at the gate Terminal 1 has very poor services for travellers. Boarding was on time and done in a very organized way. Legroom was reasonable food was very nice and service was outstanding. Cabin crews were very polite and caring. Landing on time. Baggage came with 15 mins delay due to a shortage in transporting vehicles.
560,London Heathrow - ORK. Fly regularly on this route - such a great alternative to other low cost airlines. Flight took off from London early and arrived early and same for the return. Cabin crew friendly and attentive throughout the flight. Food for purchase was good value and tasty. I have flown over 20 times with Aer Lingus and never had a bad experience. Assigned seating comfortable seats and great crew - makes flying a breeze.
561,BHX-DUB day return 15 June 2013. As a fearful flyer trying to overcome it this was a pair of practice flights for me. Flight attendants could not have been more helpful and supportive especially as they are really busy on short flight. A320s were great and though it was a gusty crosswind day for landings never felt anything but safe and supported. One attendant even provided me with some extra reading material in case I needed it to help distract me and even bought me a drink from the trolley! Was not expecting such above and beyond service. Do airlines realise how much of a good impression caring cabin crew give? Will definitely be flying with this airline again!
562,NRT-SVO-IST and BEG-SVO-NRT. NRT-SVO(333) Check-in was smooth. Lounge at NRT (Delta) was comfortable. Cabin was clean. Seat was comfortable. CAs were friendly. Food was very good. it was a nice flight. SVO-IST(321) 1 hour delay. It's not bad. BEG-SVO (320) Check in started 2 hours before the flight. Lounge was good. CAs were friendly. Food was good. SVO-NRT(333) Connection was smooth. Newest 333's seat was very comfortable for sleep. Not sliding down. Cabin was clean. CAs were very friendly. Food was excellent. It was a quite nice flight. Problem was logistics at the airport.
563,Madrid to Beijing via Moscow. I paid 457 euro with taxes included which was a great price. The plane going over was shabby looking inside with no IFE. The food was just ok and the cabin crew never even smiled once or were standing at the door with leaving the plane. I say over all they need to improve on customer service and update the planes a little.
564,RGN-SNW. Quick boarding with allocated seating for 45 minute flight in ATR72 to Ngapali Beach. Good safety briefing before time take off and light snack and drink en route. Pleasant FA's smooth flight and great landing over the surf and through the palm trees to this small exRAF WW11 strip on the Bay of Bengal. Luggage is delivered by handcart to the entrance gates-expect to pay 500kyat per piece.
565,Flew 2 internal flights in Burma with this local airline. Surprisingly new plane pretty much on time and with very pleasant crews. Also served a good snack gave out towels although flights were only about 45 minutes. Was a bit reticent about using them but very pleasantly surprised.
566,SKG-STR A320. Everything worked well despite air traffic control strikes in Greece. It was anyway one of the best medium-haul flights. Online-Check-In efficient baggage-drop-off at the counter - no queues. We had to leave Thessalonika before 6pm because of the strikes. Plane arrived late so they really did a good job to turn the plane around in 20 mins. Cabin clean proper looking. Comfortable seating. Great service with a warm meal and a wide choice of beverages. Staff unbelievably friendly and helpful. Arrived on time. Great!
567,Paris CDG-Athens. Arrived early at the checkin counter to be told to go away as I was 30 mins early when we did check in there was a queue and things were really slow due to being a terminal. Then because we had excess baggage (which took 20 mins to determine) we had to pay at another counter...20 mins to do that!!!! Then back to checkin counter for another 30 mins delay. All in all after arriving 2.8 hrs before flight departure we got to the departure gate 20 mins before boarding. A complete and utter shambles. Flight though was excellent! Cabin crew were attentive meal good and aircraft/cabin condition clean and modern.
568,MEL to MRU via Sydney and Reunion with Air Austral. Overall nice experience although the flight is long. On the long haul flight meals are quite good and there are quite a lot of things on the platter. Before landing a snack is served. Sandwiches and beverages are provided during the whole flight. On short haul drinks only are served. Flight attendants are quite efficient but can barely speak English fluently. No individual screens.
569,CDG-RUN-ZSE. Outstanding service for the economy class good food very nice ground staff and crew. Fleet is modern with B777 with high quality entertainment system. Seat pitch tight and slightly cramped. RUN airport is small and allows very short connecting time if need to continue journey to east or Saint Pierre airport.
570,Flew Air Austral Syd-Run-Mauritius-Run-Syd ??it is 100% better then Air Mauritius. The food was great and flight attendants were excellent and friendly. I?™ve got a 19 month old so they kept the middle seat for us - free and they kept offering to help and asked if everything was ok. The only drawback is theres no PTV and not much info from cockpit.
571,I fly Air Astana very often almost every week nowadays. I find the experience with new 767 ER relaxing though the flights between Astana and Almaty are always full. The ground staff keep improving. Seems new planes brought a fresh spirit on board. 767 Business Class is great and gives privacy to the customers. Looking forward to flying the Dreamliner. Food is much better than before.
572,KC 951 21 May. KC 856 21 May. I fly Air Astana very often. I find the experience relaxing though the flights between Istanbul and Almaty are usually full. The leg room is good. I think the mileage program could be improved where you could upgrade using your miles during check-in. The food is usually fresh though could be improved. Inflight entertainment is weak and needs improvement. Overall good value for money.
573,My first flight with Air Astana - London-Astana return. It was a great experience. Friendly staff and excellent service comfortable seat nice and generous food. AirAstana will be my first choice from now on.
574,As a family we have flown with Air Astana numerous times (both in economy and business class) since moving to Kazakhstan and have always been happy with the level of service. We travel with a young child and the staff have always been very friendly and helpful.
575,Sydney to Buenos Aires and had heard all the stories so I was prepared when there was an 8 hr delay in Auckland and for the broken seat and dodgy entertainment. But the price difference compared to other airlines more then made up for it. Foods was ok and the staff were good and if your prepared with a book then this is good value. Because the planes are older there is actually pretty good leg room in Economy. On my return I'd been travelling for 32hrs and they gave me an unexplained upgrade to Business Class. I was finally able to sleep and the service from the crew were great.
576,MIA-MEX roundtrip on Boeing 737-800 both legs. Crew professional offering drinks and refills. Hot breakfast on morning flight and full meal on afternoon flight back. I was offered a headset and newspapers. Both flights on time.
577,April 2nd 2013 Economy. BHX-DUB. This was my seventh flight with Aer Lingus and again they didn't disappoint. The cabin crew were excellent very friendly helpful and caring. The aircraft was an A320 and was clean and smart with the seats having good legroom and comfort. The flight was slightly late but the Captain was very informative and gave full route details. I can't comment on the food and beverages as I had none. Overall this flight was very comfortable.
578,Traveled with Aer lingus in May 2013 from London to Belfast City. Aer Lingus were punctual as I have always found on this route and the staff were pleasant enough. A major complaint is the terrible leg room their Airbus 319's which they received from Iberia. These aircraft are only just bearable for a shorter journey. I also found there to be too many in flight announcements selling food and goods. British Airways is the alternate option on this route and whilst their punctuality is not as good as Aer Lingus - every other feature is.
579,Bangkok - Moscow - Simferopol. Flights departed and arrived on time. The crew was professional and reasonable friendly. The level of English was more than adequate. The hand held entertainment systems between Bangkok and Moscow were rather dated and substandard for a business class cabin. There was no entertainment on the shorter Moscow - Simferopol sector. From Bangkok to Moscow the cabin was almost full but service standards were maintained. Food was good. From Moscow to Simferopol the cabin the crew served a good meal on the short flight.
580,PVG-SVO-AMS. Got the lowest price available by a long way so wasn't expecting too much. The flight from PVG-SVO was at 1.40am - the new planes apparently are on the earlier route so the plane was very spartan with shared TVs which showed one film throughout the whole journey. Staff were so serious that it was quite comical (does it hurt to smile?). SVO-AMS was again on a very basic plane this time with no TVs at all but at least the staff were nicer despite very poor English. Acceptable for a very cheap flight but I wouldn't choose them if there were other airlines at a similar price.
581,Flew on four separate legs within Myanmar and found them to be surprisingly good. You don't normally expect catering on flights of under an hour but there was something on all segments. Arrived in good time at Heho Airport for a flight to Yangon and they automatically put me on to an earlier departure. There is a certain amount of third world amateurism about the boarding process but it all seemed to work.
582,Took two domestic flights on Air Bagan one from Yangon to Bagan and another Mandalay to Yangon. Both flights were with ATR-72 aircraft. The interior of this aircraft was very cramped with hardly any leg space. The aircraft definitely showed its old age. The flight from Mandalay to Yangon was free seated and flight was completely full. The in-flight service was nice and they served savoury croissants and cakes with drinks. Regarding reservations the booking system is fairly tricky. Also the airline requires the passenger to confirm the flights at least 24 hours before departures. Yet the 4 phone lines are constantly busy. For both flights our hotels repeatedly tried calling to no avail. Air Bagan offers value for money because there is hardly any competitive alternative today.
583,Recently flew throughout Myanmar on the following routes: Yangon-Mandalay-Heho-Mandalay-Nyaung U (Bagan)-Heho-Thandwe-Yangon on their Fokker 100 and ATR72 aircraft. Check-in interesting as there are no computers and everything is weighed manually. Ground crew cordial but not overly friendly. Flight crews were friendly and always helpful. Catering is good for the short flights with croissants and drinks being offered on even the shortest of flights (unthinkable in Europe). Aircraft's were always spotless and comfortable.
584,Ground service is terrible compared to in the air. Manual check-in process with no computers. This airline seems to be the only one to have a lounge in the domestic terminal in Yangon. Air-conditioned and friendly associates offering a cheese croissant. No bathroom inside so that was a drag. People in Lotus class got a private van to the plane which was nice compared to cramming onto a bus. Onboard the flight was pretty good. The front of the plane is much quieter compared to the back. Their inflight magazine was pretty decent and the english grammatically correct. Even on short flights they gave you food. On my YGN-MDY flight which was about 50 minutes they served a full breakfast. Seats were pretty comfortable on par with United A320 first class seats. I don't really see the need for inflight entertainment on such short flights.
585,ATH-LHR on A321. Toys were given out to kids before take off. Many passengers had ordered special diets but FA managed to deliver our meals as quick as possible. Always ask if you need a second bread. Hot meal with one choice (beef brisket with rice) and I am amazed how they prepare such a Hong Kong style cuisine! Seats 3x3 not very spacious but good enough for flights less than 4 hours.
586,London Heathrow - Larnaca. I found Aegean's price reasonable and A320 was very comfortable. The crew were happy to help and free meals were included which was nice. Great that Heathrow Terminal 4 is used too. Cannot fault.
587,Noumea to Sydney found Air Austral staff friendly and good customer service. My only issue was the size of the seats in economy - a tight fit.
588,KC621 Almaty-Astana 22/4/2014. Flown old Boeing 757 in business. Old chairs/layout. Plenty of legroom good for sitting and on a short flight less than 2 hours no need to lie down. A full meal was served on this short flight. A very nice vegetarian meal. No entertainment available or offered. No business lounge available on domestic fights.
589,KC856 Astana-Almaty 24/4/2014. Flown new Boeing 767 in business. Good new chairs (fully flat nice big touch LCD- screens) and modern interior. Nice choice of entertainment. And much to my surprise a full meal on a flight less than two hours. Good vegetarian meal. Pity they do not have business lounges on domestic flights.
590,I travel very frequently on Air Astana from Delhi-Almaty. Check-in staff at Delhi and Almaty are very efficient. I had a wonderful experience on 18 April flying from Delhi to Almaty. The flight crew went out of their way to take care of passengers needs.
591,April 4 KC951 from Almaty to Astana. Return April 4 from Astana to Almaty KC854. Had the pleasure of flying Air Astanas new 767 service between Astana and Almaty. It was the best domestic economy class service I have flown. Each seat has in seat videos with the latest films tv music etc. I had a choice of international newspapers as well as a warm sandwich and drink. As usual the crew were smiling multi lingual and well dressed. The seats had a good tilt.
592,There seems to be a polarity of views on AR between Australia/New Zealand based travellers and those who use AR regularly for domestic and regional services. It may be the case that both are right but for fairness I have to say that in 15 yrs of domestic flights and regional services to/from Brazil and Paraguay I have never experienced more than 30 mins delay and have always received good service in Economy class.
593,AGU-MEX-JFK E170/B737-800 in economy plus. Aeromexico had the lowest walk-up fare and still acceptable connection in Mexico City. Onboard service professional occasionally smiling and frequently offering beverages. T2 Terminal in MEX is comfortable and acceptable eating and other amenities. MEX-JFK a hot meal and beverages incl alcohol and newspapers/magazines. FAs were curt. The only downside to AM is that they are rarely competitive on fares relative to American Airlines CO and US on advance purchases.
594,MIA-MEX on Boeing 737 and MEX-DGO on Embraer 190. Clean modern aircraft. Served breakfast and drinks by friendly flight crew. Flights on time and terminal 2 in Mexico city airport out is amazing.
595,We flew Boston Logan to Dublin and Shannon to Boston on Aer Lingus. It was our first experience on this airline and we were very pleased. The planes were A330-200s and were clean and in good condition. Very good entertainment choices. Food was standard airline fare. I didn't order the upgraded meal because I didn't think it would be any better but from comments that I've heard next time I probably will next time. Flight attendants were friendly.
596,"On the Dublin to Chicago flight on the Friday returning Tuesday late afternoon. Nothing bad at all outbound on time departure and arrival flight crew were excellent ordered the ""Extra "" menu for Euro and it was worth every penny. Flight back you cannot order the extra menu which is a great shame again the flight crew were open friendly and very professional - flight left late and arrived very early. Couldn't fault them at all - spot on. Well done to Aer Lingus."
597,Milan Malpensa to Tokyo via Moscow - July 25 2012. Friendly staff on board less so on the ground. A330 new efficient with good entertainment on board.
598,DEL-SVO SVO-KRR KRR-SVO and SVO-DEL. DEL-SVO was late by more than 6 hours and as per the airline rules we should have got a hotel stay. Instead we had to spend the whole 6.5 hours at the IGI T3. Supposed to board an A330-200 which was unfortunately unavailable so we boarded a A330-300 with wide and comfortable seats and on-board entertainment facility! An hour after take off came the drinks. Then the main- course followed by a delicious cake and a cup of tea or coffee. All flights were smooth and flight staff courteous. In all my experience was very good.
599,AMS-SVO check in opens 2.5 hrs before long lines online check in was not possible. Flight boarded on time it was a A321 instead of the scheduled A320 due to high volume booking as elite plus we were lucky to be upgraded which was a very pleasant surprise. Welcome drink amenity set and a 2x2 configuration. After take off received a nice hot lunch and a drink but the remaining 2 hours no service quite odd. For business seats for European business good service should be better. DIGI player was good for a 3.5 hr flight.
600,Yangon-Bagan. ATR-72. Decent plane old and tired but as you'd expect from an airline in Burma. There was 1 cabin crew member and the co-pilot. Very pleasant service and a nice cheese croissant for the flight. Completely empty so you could stretch out over two seats which is important for me being 6ft 3.
601,Chiang Mai to Yangon return and pleasantly surprised by the standard - fairly new aircraft and meal service for 50 minute flight. Flight attendants were somewhat offhand. Reasonable leg room in economy.
602,Yangon to Lashio in November 2009 ATR 42 plane. Allocated seating and good snack served with excellent customer service. Would fly with them again any time!
603,ATH-LHR economy. Very comfortable seats excellent meal clean and new aircraft and in-flight entertainment. Frequent flyer department are sometimes a bit difficult to deal with and I would have liked more in-flight information from the flight deck. Definitely value for money for a direct flight.
604,ATH-LHR A321 new and clean . Sat in row 4A perhaps too far front as the you cant see the TV screen at all due to the fact it is placed on the Business Class Divider (first 3 rows are business class). Flight well priced and I like the fact that their tickets are changable by paying a small fee. The food was fine but portions were too small. Asked for a second meal which was provided after 5 minutes. The luggage collection landing in Heathrow was too slow and took forever. Despite these small issues Aegean Airlines is an airline that I enjoy flying with and the best choice by far out of Athens.
605,Have travelled with Aegean a number of times already and service is impeccable. Ground crew eager to help and facilitate flights on time comfortable journeys with nice meals on board.
606,MXP-ATH in Economy class. Excellent onboard service and some of the best airline meals. The flight attendants were nice and professionally handled a medical emergency right after landing.
607,I use Air Astana regularly since I have moved to work in Kazakhstan and currently prefer it to the other airlines I have used. I try to arrange my trips back to the UK around the direct flights to LHR. I have never experienced a delayed or cancelled flight the staff are well-trained and generally open and friendly and the food is not exceptional but is of a consistently good quality. I usually travel economy class though on the occasions when I have used business class it has been a good experience.
608,Flight KC912 April 2nd from Istanbul to Almaty. It was a fantastic flight crew helpful and smiling. All announcements very clear understandable and most important things for me multi-language Turkish English Russian and Kazakh. The way aircraft was new.
609,I have been using the services of Air Astana for years. Always a pleasure to travel starting from the convenient way of purchasing the ticket and excellent relation of crew members. I quite often take the domestic flights around two times a month and therefore comfort is crucial for me. In January I travelled to Frankfurt from Astana. As usual right from boarding until landing it was an enjoyable journey.
610,I have travelled several times with Aerolineas. Buenos Aires-Rio De Janeiro and Montevideo. Domestically I have flown between Buenos Aires and Mendoza Cordoba and Salta. I only have praise for the staff and organisation of this airline. I have encountered polite efficiency from check in staff and air crew the aircraft were clean and I experienced no delay or problems with the flights.
611,IAH-MEX-IAH economy. First leg on B738 and E190 on the way back. Comfortable flights given that I had cheapest economy ticket and got seated in premium seat in the front of the aircraft on an outbound flight. Some breakfast items on quite a short flights were a nice touch and crew were friendly. Good value for money.
612,April 27 2013 we took an A330 Airbus from Dublin to Orlando direct. The food was the best I have had on an airline. All flight attendants were cheerful and courteous. The only complaint is that at Dublin airport our boarding passes stated that the gate closed at 10.55 am even though our flight did not leave until 12.40 pm. I do not appreciate being given misleading information like that even if the airline is only doing it to get the slackers to show up on time. I say leave them a couple of times when they are late and they will learn to be on time and not cause the rest of us to show up at the gate only to sit for almost two more hours after already spending two hours going through security and customs! Also the seat cushions on the plane are getting too compressed to have a comfortable trip lasting 9 hours. The seat cushions should be replaced with new ones.
613,"No real complaints about the flight or in service facilities. Main complaint is about the badly designed website. I was flying Shannon to Boston and then on to Tampa with JetBlue. AL kept emailing me to complete the ""Additional Information Required"". However their website kept rejecting my booking reference. Tried to email them (no reply). Tried over 3 days to telephone AL kept getting recorded messages. Spent at least 1 hour trying to get through to a ""person"". Eventually did to be told my booking reference was rejected as I was flying on to another destination (Tampa). Then she took the additional info and did it for me. Seems this is a routine problem! AL also could not print off Jetblue boarding card Jetblue referred me back to AL."
614,LHR to Cork return. On time departure from Heathrow and early arrival into Cork. Early Departure from Cork and on stand 20 mins early into Heathrow. Clean cabin each way and efficient (if a bit brusque) cabin crew. Had reasonably priced drinks on the way out only with the bar service prompt and fast. We paid extra for row 1 which was worth every penny. The only downside was oversize bags in the cabin along with perhaps half of the plane breaking the one piece of hand baggage rule leading to no space in the overhead bins. On a par price wise with other competitors on the route (once extras are added in) but overall my preferred choice between London and Cork with good legroom pleasant staff and a reserved seat.
615,JFK-SNN-JFK. Excellent flights in both directions. Cabin crew very professional and attentive. Found the check-in process at JFK terminal 5 with JetBlue staff to be extremely slow. Check-in at Shannon was excellent and very efficient. Clearing USA customs in Shannon saved a lot of time and aggravation that I have experienced coming in from other European countries.
616,I flew May 3rd NYC-MOSCOW connection MOSCOW-KIEV $1500 2 adult tickets. The flight was great! On time and arrived early in Moscow on a nice Airbus A330. The plane was fairly new. The seats bathrooms and interior of the plane was excellent. The food on the transatlantic flight there and back were both great. Chicken or fish with veggies bread and chocolate. The only complaint I would make is they serve the drinks and wait too long to serve the food. They served the drinks 15 mins before the food was served so by the time I got my food I had no drink. The service was 7 of 10. The flight from Moscow to Kiev was excellent as well. 1hr and 15mins on time. Overall Aeroflot is a good airline I would fly with them again!
617,JFK to Moscow. Check-in went smoothly. From JFK-SVO the seats were as comfortable as could be. Flight attendants were friendly the food very good: served drinks dinner tea/coffee drinks breakfast tea/coffee. I felt comfortable asking for additional drinks. Inflight entertainment had a very good selection. Once I arrived in Moscow my bags needed to be collected and checked in again. When I came back to the airport 9 hours later I was surprised to find that check-in was easy with no long lines. Once onboard I was surprised to find the airplane in such good condition. There was no inflight entertainment on a 5.5 hour flight but the crew were friendly. The food was my only real disappointment. I'll definitely be flying Aeroflot in the future.
618,Usually I'm flying Economy for business purposes and Business class for leisure. When flying Economy Aeroflot is very good for short haul flights to EU. When flying Business quality issues arise. Lounges sometimes are packed both in terminals D and F especially in the morning or late in the evening. Secondly onboard quality service is unsustainable: sometimes attendants are nice and helpful sometimes rude and evasive. Aeroflot always forgets about its Business class passengers and priority Boarding especially in terminal F for long haul flights. However the major problem is the home airport of Sheremetyevo. In most cases people are spending an awful long time just to leave the airport area. Queuing in a traffic jam next to the airport for an hour on Saturday night after a 2 week vacation and Business Class experience crosses everything out about the Aeroflot flight. So my recommendation to use Aeroflot would pretty much depend on the route time and class.
619,Yangon-Thandwe(Ngapali)-Yangon. The flights were operated by ATR-42. Seating is not comfortable unless you take an emergency-exit row but on 40-50 minute flight you don't need comfortable seats. Inflight service great. Wet paper towels given to each passenger on the entrance to the plane. The food service was rather interesting - they gave us a chicken sandwich (really tasty) then they brought around some coffee and tea and about 10 minutes later-Cola and Sprite on a tray. Crew were very friendly and polite. Yangon Airport in its domestic part is really not modern with some not- functioning facilities and broken toilets. Thandwe airport is an experience itself! Overall Air Bagan offers excellent reliable service and I will fly it again when visiting a wonderful country Myanmar!
620,Have made several flights with Aegean Airlines in the past year. It was very good value for money. Flights mostly on time inflight service exceptional and friendly FA's. Helpful ground staff. Overall this will be my preferred carrier to Greece.
621,CDG TO ATH. Very pleasant flight on time new A320 film with french translation earphone was free. Food hot and excellent. Crew were helpful. Very nice experience.
622,This airline was very helpful during a very difficult time. They did not deliberately increase their prices during the mad panic caused by the bad weather in Europe in the days before Christmas. My original booking to travel London to Athens was with KLM and then I was passed to Air France. Neither of them could organize things properly and after endless problems it took them 4 days to get me only as far as Paris with no hope of leaving for at least a day. Aegean came to my rescue and even though they also took off late they made sure I did not miss my next flight with them to a Greek island. During this 4 day nightmare I had to rebook my domestic flight several times with Aegean and they were very accommodating.
623,IST-ATH-SKG Business. Very good airline clean planes both on time friendly cabin crew. Got a hot meal on the IST-ATH flight but didnÂ´t have time to finish it due to short length of flight stewardess very apologetic. Will definitely fly them again.
624,Flying from Almaty to KL KC935 was very good we had an excellent inflight meal and the staff on the plane were helpful and friendly. The seats were comfortable and the leg room was good. I was able to check in online and then at the airport changed my seat to the emergency exit seats due to the extra leg room with no problems at all. Kuala Lumpur is fantastic and as we head towards George Town we are looking forward to exploring more of Malaysia and of course the return flight with Air Astana.
625,Flight KC907 March 21st and back on KC908 March 26th. I flew with my family from Almaty to Delhi and back and we were all very happy with the flights. The crew was nice and attentive departures were on time and we really enjoyed the time onboard.
626,KC 110 and KC 949 31st January. KC 950 18th February. Air Astana is a very good airline. Staff are friendly and helpful. Because of the demonstrations in Bangkok we had to rebook our flights. Air Astana offered us a free upgrade to Ho Chi Minh City though the ticket was more expensive.
627,I was lucky enough to be on one of Air Astana's new Boeing 767s returning from Bangkok to Almaty on the 12th January 2014. My business class seat was worth paying the extra over economy with the full lay flat seat and lots of room to spread out with a wide side table. Over the time I've been flying Air Astana I have seen them polishing their cabin service and the professionalism and presentation of the staff is of a high standard. Beverage service was very good although the food let the otherwise excellent travel experience down a little the meal was below par for business class. This was in contrast to the trip down to Bangkok and all previous international flights with Air Astana where the food has been very good.
628,AEP to Calafate Calafate to Ushuaia: Ushuaia to AEP. I was surprised at the overall quality of the Aerolineas Argentinas operations : online check-in inflight service from friendly and professional crew and the snacks including the quick Calafate to Ushuaia hop. The radar went down at Ushuaia and AR sent three bus loads of passengers on a four hour bus ride to Rio Grande through a heavy mountain snow. As the buses arrived in Rio Grande the Aerolineas Argentinas flight landed and a completely full flight was airborne for AEP in less than an hour.
629,EZE to Santa Cruz. Everything was fine - no queue to check in flight was on time decent snack on board and aircraft reasonably new. So nothing special but nothing to complain about either.
630,Cancun to Mexico City Business Class. Flight slightly delayed but compensated for by being able to check luggage to onward British Airways flight to London. Crew attentive and professional. Cold lunch very average. Easy to get to Terminal 1 using the air train and despite the information on Mexico City Airport website there were plenty of people with more than just hand luggage - they do check your e-ticket though (didn't need boarding card).
631,Mexico City - Cancun return. Clean modern 737 aircraft that departed on time professional bi-lingual flight attendants. Inflight service consisted of just a drink service (with free booze) and a pack of peanuts. Their terminal 2 at Mexico City is a beautiful modern facility. Its just a shame they don't offer online check in or self service check in.
632,LAX-Acapulco via MEX. We booked via Delta so expected to pay for baggage and have no meals. But Aeromexico baggage still free and nice meals on long leg of trip both ways. Drink and snack on 35 minute Acapulco-MEX leg. Staff were charming and helpful. We had a delay leaving Acapulco and the agent who checked us in for the flight came and told us that the flight was delayed leaving Mexico City. He had rebooked our flight to LAX and changed our baggage claim tags. We both had first class seats assigned. Unfortunately we both found the new first class seat design on the 737-800 torturous. The headrest appears to have been designed for crash test dummies. We had been much more comfortable in our coach seats.
633,DUB-BRU-DUB good service and great value for money on this route. A321 almost 15 years old but clean and comfortable with excellent leather seats and adjustable head-rest. Ground service was competent and speedy and cabin crew were friendly professional and well groomed engaging with passengers. There is a newly updated menu with drinks and snacks available to purchase. I was disappointed to see that there is a now a more limited selection than previous versions of the menu but prices are still keen and quality is very good. All in all vastly superior to Ryanair when flying from Ireland to Belgium.
634,I travelled from Dublin to Boston and Boston to Dublin (23-26 April 2013). I have been positively surprised. Pretty new A330-202 good entertainment good food. The only weak point was the readiness of the staff in Dublin to solve a problem with ESTA Visa. Fortunately I was able to find a helpful person at Aer Lingus at the end.
635,Dublin - Santiago return. Both flights on time. Excellent service from Irish cabin crew. Food for purchase but reasonably priced and tasty. Only complaint was lack of staff at passport control in Dublin so long queues. Cant understand. Felt sorry for All non EU passport holders. Not Aer Lingus fault but only glitch in otherwise faultless travel experience.
636,St Petersburg - Moscow. Flight was delayed by more than 30 minutes with no explanations or apologies. Sat on the tarmac for some time. A light snack was served and included drinks. Seat was reasonable comfortable and luggage came quickly enough. Didn't hear any English from the cabin staff. No inflight entertainment but only a short flight.
637,Flew Economy class from JFK to Moscow and then onwards from Moscow to Delhi. The aircraft's are new with rear entertainment in each seat. Food is excellent on the JFK to Moscow flight but down hill from Moscow to Delhi. Service on Aeroflot on all segments is very slow after meal service for food trays to be picked up but good rounds of drinks are provided along side coffee and tea after the meal service.
638,"With a business class ticket we got into the admiral club at JFK. Club was neat, comfortable, offered two cocktails and pre-flight snacks including a corn bisque which was quite good. Boarding the plane was quick and soon enough we were airborne. The A332 is roomy but the seats in business were tight and at times a bit uncomfortable. Without an air control, the temp got really sweaty and hot. Sleeping was rough! Food was sufficient but there was no prior cocktail service. Nothing was offered. After asking, the FA was cordial and served us the drinks of choice. Service was professional and exceptionally quick. Flight was safe and upon arriving on route to Rhodes, the lounge in Germany was a great place to get a rest and some complimentary breakfast, the lounge was better than AA's admiral's club at JFK. Dependable but nothing special for a business class service. Would rather fly American Business."
639,LHR-ATH-HER return. The seats were more comfy and planes were clean and tidy. The staff were nice and friendly. The food was extremely nice although you do not get a choice. All this was complimentary.
640,Istanbul to Athens - the best flight with the most courteous flight attendants I have flown in the past 20 years. Keep up the excellent service.
641,LHR-ATH return. Crew very friendly and efficient. Food fine - greek oriented cuisine with complementary drinks. Seats comfortable reasonable legroom. As we had young children check in staff put priority labels on our bags for us. My only minor complaints would be at Heathrow they have just 3 or so desks and only open these a couple of hours or so before departure so you have to queue up to check the bags in - web check in is not that straightforward - I was unable to check us all in together but had to do it as 4 separate check ins. Also unable to purchase a ticket online for my son as he was 1yr old at time of booking but 2yrs old when flying and their website could not handle that. Otherwise a very pleasant start and finish to our holiday.
642,Athens to Santorini. Aegean have a modern fleet of mostly A320s. The flight was short but efficient. Seats comfortable. Business lounge in Athens is small but has a great variety of food.
643,"Not a bad flight but the use of an ageing 757 with seats that looked like they belonged in the 1970s were a disappointment given the trumpeting of their ""new"" business class on their website - I think this is more than disingenuous but Air Astana are hardly alone in this. Staff were friendly and helpful. Lack of business lounge in ALA a major minus. Food average. All in all fair service as it should be noted that this is half the price of BA."
644,"My family of 2 adults and 2 children flew from Astana to Abu Dhabi (non-stop) and back via Almaty. Although it was a New year vacation period with heavy passenger load all services - starting with tickets sales to luggage delivery were efficient and precise. On our way back we flew a brand new Boeing-767 and it was the best plane I have taken so far. We had to stay in Almaty for a night because of the weather conditions and ""Air Astana"" provided us with great rooms in a downtown hotel and round trip transfer. Staff were polite professional and competitive."
645,PEK-ALA-TSE-SVO. Red-eye flight from Beijing to Almaty on B757-200. The aircraft is old but well-attended. Seats are ok. Cabin crew speak good English. Catering was served in the middle of the flight. Passengers who were sleeping were not offered their meals and amenity kits. Arrived early. Almaty-Astana-Moscow on A320. Food is tasty. Good choice of drinks including alcohol. Entertainment is outdated - just magazines music and a movie. Both flights on time. Smooth landings. We checked our baggage straight from Beijing to Moscow. It was a bit risky with 2 stop-overs but the airline staff assisted us in Kazakhstan and checked if the bags followed us. They were very helpful and the ground crew were efficient because our baggage arrived safely at SVO. I would recommend Air Astana if the prices are adequate.
646,MAD-EZE return. On the upper deck on the way to Argentina: service was good food as well - seat worked and slept nearly the whole flight. On the way back on the much smaller lower deck flight attendant was somewhat short-sighted and set everyone in wrong seats - we had our laughs. Seat was a bit broken but found some sleep. Food wasn't so good on the flight back to Europe.
647,AEP-FTE via Ushuaia check in chaotic use web check in! New B737-700 nice crew on both legs drinks and food service (cakes cereal bar) nice flight on time arrival. Surprised reading other reviews or lucky. Price for internal flights quite high.
648,MEX-LIM. Nice and fast check-in procedures inside the beautiful Aeromexico lounge at new Terminal 2. Flight operated by a freshly re-painted B737-800 - first time I experience an almost 6 hour flight on this kind of plane but the interior was clean and confortable so this was not a big issue. The only problem was that we were at row 12 just before the emergency exit so our seats would not recline for safety reasons: I would have appreciated to be informed about that before the assignment! Meal was served very early (6pm) considering mexican habits but I did not eat so I cannot judge. Crew polite even if not very friendly. We arrived at Lima half an hour ahead of schedule. Overall a positive experience but the price could have been more competitive (we paid EUR 1.000 for two economy tickets).
649,We recently traveled from the US to Ireland. When we called in on seat assignments for the flight over we paid an extra $60 per person for seats that were to have more room (Rows 9-12) so we could sleep better. Turns out that the seats we had on the way home had more leg room and reclined further so that was wasted money. On the way home the entertainment recycled twice so there was a while where you couldn't watch a movie and since we were in the middle of one when it went down had to adjust it to get back to the spot where it crashed.
650,DUB to NYC return. A330 found it comfortable and in flight services good. I would comment positively on the check in at Dublin handled quickly and with the US pre-clearance it saved massively on the US side landing in a domestic terminal. On return found the Aer Lingus ground staff in JFK friendly and efficient. Overnight flight to Dublin was quite and comfortable.
651,"Economy from Glasgow via Dublin to New York return. Glasgow to Dublin flight arrived on time and all US bound passengers were met at the arriving flight and bussed to the international terminal. For this flight we had US Pre-clearance at Dublin Airport. However waiting time was horrendous. Flight was due to depart at 10.15 and at 10.45 we still hadn't completed this procedure. Aer Lingus held the onward flight for all connecting passengers resulting in a one hour delay leaving Dublin. Airbus 330-300 seating was comfortable enough for the 6 hr flight. The on demand video system offered ample films. The headphones however of poor quality and sound. A pre-dinner drink was served. Soft drinks are free alcoholic drinks have to be paid for. Meal was mediocre and tasteless. The crew did not come around offering drinks. The younger cabin attendants were friendly. Older crew members acted like their job was a chore. Many not able to smile. Because we had pre-cleared US Immigration at Dublin we were therefore classified as a ""domestic flight"" and landed at Jet Blue's Terminal 5 in JFK. Because of this and the somewhat lower fare these points would be the only reason I would choose to fly Aer Lingus again."
652,Flight SXF-SVO-SXF. Very new A320 aircraft with lots of leg room. FA's speak good English are friendly and generally very attentive. For this price I can only recommend Aeroflot on European short distance flights. Be aware though that things are different on long haul.
653,MAD-SVO-MAD; Check in easy both ways. Boarding a little late also on both flights and arrival also late (15 min). During the flights all on 320 aircraft's they are comfortable but nothing special 32'' seat pitch. No IFE for nearly 5 hour travel time. Food decent and good quality. Flight attendants not friendly but polite do their job. They also offer drinks several time during the flight. Recommended for European travel to/from Russia.
654,"The new business class is outstanding. Service is top notch, so are the food and drink. The seats are comfortable and have a massage function included. The way they are placed gives you loads of privacy. Way better than Lufthansa, KLM etc."
655,"Excellent experience. Good entertainment selection for the long flight, good food for airline food."
656,"Check in Cologne was nice and fast and no problem, topbonus number was checked. Boarding was nice and fast, we were welcomed when entering the aircraft. Flight crew informed about flight and cabin crew did a nice job. I got one coffee and a glass of water with a nice muesli bar. You can choose between salty and sweet, all of this is for free. Baggage at Berlin Tegel was fast and we arrived on time. Return flight was the same only the plane was a Bombardier propeler plane, which I like because seating is 2-2 and you can see more. Crew was fine again and this time I choosed salty and got a bag of prezzels. Since this was a small plane, we were bused to gate, but it was fast again. Air Berlin is a good airline and I booked again CGN-TXL-CGN with them."
657,MUC-ATH. The seating was standard European Business with the middle seat blocked. The highlight of the flight was the meal which was a pasta dish with shrimp calamari and tomato sauce - simply excellent. Friendly crew and good service as well as the meal.
658,ATH to FRA. Nice clean A320 polite and smiling crew. Service consisted of nice hot dish (unusual these days for short haul) and dessert Just one round of drinks (wine and beers available free of charge) but those who asked were served a second one with a smile. Crew perhaps a bit too tolerant with passengers who did not respect the seat belt sign during taxiing. .
659,LHR-ATH-LHR. Booked at the last minute because of the BA strike. BMI lounge excellent at T1 Swissport lounge at Athens almost as good. Modern clean A321-200 seats 2A/C outbound & 1D/F inbound. FAs excellent. Food service rather rushed outbound with no pre-lunch drinks and no offer of champagne pre take-off. Food average quality but good to have the Greek accent. Food service and quality similar inbound and still no sign of champagne. IFE unusually provided on a 4 hr flight but consisted of just a single film on overhead drop-down LCD screens. Priority baggage return worked remarkably well both outbound and inbound and the general efficiency of the new Athens airport was a delight. Overall a good product.
660,Customer support uninterested and never answer emails (despite the fact that I am a Gold card holder). Only contracted lounge in ATH if you are flying extra-Schengen. Unacceptable for the largest carrier in Greece since two of the most popular destinations are extra-Schengen: London and Larnaca. Some of the flight attendants have the nasty habit of ignoring passengers and thereby forgetting to bring drinks or meals to some. Hidden charges - this is not a no- frills airline yet you get charged for booking your flight online (10 EUR) there is no way around this fee as if you buy it over the phone you pay as well if you buy at their ticket desk as well.
661,Athens - Tel Aviv return. The price was fair flight was pleasant staff polite cabin clean the food very average as usual!
662,I travelled with my family on the ALA-BKK flight on Dec 15 2013 and back on the BKK-ALA flight on Jan 4 2014 and both flights were on their brand new 767. The seat comfort was the best I have ever experienced in Economy and the leg room was significantly more spacious than in other economy cabins. Both flights were on time and despite very full flights the service was very efficient and pleasant.
663,EZE-COR and back new Austral E-190 with good legroom and interesting IFE. The flight is only an hour long so I wasn't expecting food the snack provided was decent. Used the web check-in so airports were a breeze. The staff and cabin crew was friendly and energetic. However they still have punctuality issues: both my flights were 30 minutes late and screens at the airport showed that many of their flights were delayed too.
664,Flew on the Gatwick/Belfast route 4 times in 2 weeks. Saw today they've increased from 3 to 4 flights a day so I presume they're doing well. They are in direct competition now with FlyBe who used to have this route to themselves and competition can only be a good thing IMHO. AE flight times are very similar to BE although we left before them twice even though their departure time was first. I think that reflects the increased pressure Flybe have on their turnaround times. The service is better on AE even though you still have to pay for food and drink the planes are better (A319s) and were immaculate. Only had hand luggage so can't comment on airport check-in. I did mine using their phone app which worked perfectly. The only niggle is their charging to book seats in the first 5 rows I find it a bit money-grasping. Will definitely continue to use them on this route as long as the price and service continue in the same vein.
665,Flew DUB-LGW-DUB recently and everything went smoothly. Paid extra for front seats Row 3 on way out and row 1 on way back for quick exit and was worth it. Also less hassle and pressure than Ryanair on same route and times. Tickets were only marginally dearer and not enough to make me join the rush for a seat on FR. Flight was on time in both directions even with de-icing procedures. Ground and flight staff were both excellent but sometimes I wish they would enforce the cabin baggage regulations - even a little bit.
666,IST-SVO-PEK return. Pleasantly surprised. 200??cheaper than everyone else. New clean A330 aircraft with good IFE for long-haul flights. Good food. Language skills and friendliness of staff fair. Last leg back home to IST was with an old IL96. All in all would definitely fly them again.
667,"Good checkin, fast boarding. Free magazines during boarding. Free soft drinks and a sandwich. The staff on board were very friendly and attentive. I can recommend Air Berlin."
668,Flew from Stuttgart (STR) to Hamburg (HAM). The online check-in worked without problems and really fast. On the airport you could choose between a few magazines and newspapers you were able to take on the flight (no fee). The flight itself was on time and the staff was very friendly. Even on that short flight (around 50mins) we got offered a drink and a snack (Lindt chocolate or crisps). At leaving the airplane we got Air Berlin chocolate- hearts. The flight back was excellent too. The online check-in worked and the flight was perfectly on time. Very friendly staff and good service again. The flight attendant accidentally spilled a drop of coffee because of turbulence. She gave me two more chocolates as excuse which I found very kind. At all I can say that Air Berlin is a very good airline especially for German and European flights. Also the value for money is very good. I would definitely recommend Air Berlin.
669,I flew non-stop TXL-JFK on 13 March and I was extremely surprised about Air Berlin's new Business Class service. Let's not mention TXL airport though. The rotten airport (including the Air France Business Lounge gates and boarding area) is a disgrace which I will not blame Air Berlin for. However once I boarded the plane the service was so amazing - like in good old times. I got greeted by my name. Blankets slippers amenity kits are individually brought to you with a smile. The new flat seat feels more like a private cabin than a seat - much better than Lufthansa's new Business Class or AA's new one that I used recently too. The food and bar service was like in a restaurant - including a special dish of the day that was not on the menu. Last not least: The flight attendants were tremendously kind and attentive.
670,BRU-ATH-BRU. Both flights very nice new aircraft on time decent food (hot meal) with entertainment and this on a 2.5 hour flight.
671,ATH-IST on a new A320 (there is a possibility of e-check-in or mobile phone check-in). personally I am not using those services. I prefer the traditional check-in line which was convenient and not crowded. The service was nice the crew was friendly but when I asked for a newspaper the flight attendant took a note of my seat; but she never brought me the newspaper (may be they run out of newspapers because they had lot of people in business class). In the returned flight the flight attendant noticed my seat and then she brought the newspaper to me. There was no IFF but on overhead screen you could see the map of the flight and flight information. Food was nice with selection of wine or beer. Both flights on time and about 60% full. On the return flight they had time for duty free trolley.
672,I travelled with Air Astana business class from Kuala Lumpur to Almaty on Sunday October 20th 2013. The whole experience was very enjoyable and comfortable. The cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful and the service was excellent. The food was particularly enjoyable and I was able to relax and enjoy the trip back to Almaty after a hectic week in KL.
673,Travelled to JFK from LGW via DUB return. Went out coach and came back Business. The equivalent BA flight (coach both ways) would have been an extra Â£600 for the dates I wanted. The other thing was the convenience of using LGW instead of the awful LHR T5. Had a very early and quiet departure from LGW. Boarding was nearly on time and quite smooth. The food on board was appalling. It seems that if you pre- order meals you get far better quality. Maybe that should be made clear on the booking website. I needed to take some medication towards the end of the flight and asked the crew for a glass of water. It was provided in a very flimsy plastic 'glass'. Return leg in Business was on the evening redeye. Check-in was fine. Lounge was ok. Once the flight was called and I went to gate we still had another 30 mins wait. Business class seats had a huge control panel but no documentation on how to operate them. Trial and error eventually got the seat flat. The food was poor for business class. The white wine and fizz were excellent but the Italian red with the steak was disgusting. Breakfast was poor for business class. I would have expected an attempt at a cooked breakfast. But maybe that's why it was so much cheaper than BA.
674,DUB-MCO-DUB. Efficient check-in with added bonus of fast track security in Dublin. Good lounge experience particularly in Dublin. Recaro seats very comfortable. Food quality very good and quality wines served. Staff attentive without being intrusive. A very comfortable way to cross the Atlantic.
675,PEK-SVO-BCN-SVO-PEK in Business class. PEK-SVO and SVO-PEK flights on A330-200 and A330-300. SVO- BCN-SVO on A321. Staff spoke good English food was tasty and served with good china. Amenity bags given out on all legs including European flights. Drinks are good. A330 seats are not full flat but managed to sleep on both legs. A321 seats are real business class seats not economy seat with empty middle seats. AVOD pretty good plenty in English. Business lounge at SVO Terminal F is new but Terminal E is in pretty old - could not find a seat. Lounge food and drink limited. Transit at SVO was not as bas as expected. Issuing business lounge at transit desk can be pain as you need this access card to get into lounge but you can only get the access card through transit desk. No priority boarding on all legs. I will definitely fly Aeroflot again if they keep the standard.
676,Munich-Tokyo - pleasantly surprised. Plane from Moscow to Tokyo was brand new. Very good and extensive entertainment program with many choices. Tickets were cheap. Stewardess was nice and the food was good. The big downside however is Moscow Airport. Other shops close early and the prices are very expensive the staff seems a bit careless. Just doesn't manage to keep up with bigger airports.
677,Self Check-in is easy for use but unfortunately not cover most abroad airport (e.g. CDG France). Manual Check-in is a little slow. Meal is very good even for economy class. The staff attitude and friendliness is impressive. And the flight is very comfortable.
678,ATH-LHR on A321 was great with nice inflight entertainment. Food average and crew professional.
679,I take Air Astana flights on regular basis local and international economy and business. There are a lot of modern new air planes that are being added continuously to Air Astana. The service is much more pleasant and more active inside the plane because the crew are very young comparing to KLM British Airways Lufthansa. The food is comparatively much better than other international airlines. In some planes they have some seats that are very unusual but comfortable you can sleep on them very easy and comfortable. On the international flight prices they are very reasonable. I'm definitely recommending use Air Astana.
680,13 Oct 2013 KC887 Business Class. Almaty - Beijing. Thoroughly professional service good food! Great entertainment on iPad excellent on board staff simple check in procedure. Lacks lounge in Almaty.
681,AKL-SYD one way. I booked this flight with pretty low expectations. The flight was 90 minutes late. However this flight was better than expected. A340s used on this route are old. However the seats were comfortable and leg room acceptable. The complimentary light meal coffee and juice were tasty and appreciated. The cabin crew's English was quite good - some of the crew were young and friendly while there were a couple of more experienced and more gruff senior crew who shouted orders. All PAs are given in Spanish first then English. It was very hard to understand the English notices as the English spoken was heavily accented. There are no personal TVs and on this three hour sector no movies were shown - just the route map on the main screens. Their service is significantly lower quality than their main competitor LAN but they are also significantly cheaper. I think it would be less comfortable to fly the much longer AKL-EZE sector on this airline but for AKL-SYD they were fine.
682,MAD to BUE and back in economy class. B747-400 used were really old no personal screens in the seatbacks only small ceiling screens. Furthermore on MAD-BUE flight the inflight entertainment system gave up working shortly after the safety movie so no movie or Airshow at all. Meal/drink service was absolutely minimal no drinks at all during both 12h night flights. Cabin announcements unmotivated and in bad English. The old fashioned seats were very comfortable. great legrooom and recline. Bring your own food drinks and entertainment don't expect anything special from the cabin crew but enjoy the comfy seats which are much better than those ultra-thin seats which most leading carriers offer today.
683,Flew on the new service from London Gatwick to Belfast City airport and was very impressed with the service. Great price lovely comfortable planes on time and very efficient boarding (probably helped that the plane was only 2/3rd full). Only drawback although not necessarily the airlines fault is the horrible small dingy and dirty departure gate they use at Gatwick South terminal.
684,Cork to Malaga and satisfied with all aspects of the flight. On time comfortable pleasant crew good food and excellent value for money. I usually fly Ryanair from Shannon - who possess none of the above qualities - except blowing trumpets on arrival. For me to use Aer Lingus to travel to Spain means an extra 60 mile road trip which I am happy to take.
685,HKG-SVO-HKG A330 Economy. Both legs slightly delayed planes reasonably well kept and seats are comfortable with average pitch and recline. Limited choice of movies and TVs on the seat back AVOD IFE. Food was ok. 2 meals but no mid-flight snack for the 10hr flight. Plenty of water runs. Crew pleasant enough.
686,Flew over the Easter holidays from Cologne to Berlin. Flight was rebooked to an early morning flight which was not as planed. Checked in online with no problem. Staff was nice and as soon we were airborne service began. The cabin had a nice smell of fresh coffee and fresh baked roll for breakfast. Soon I was served a cup of hot coffee one glass of apple juice and a hot saltbread roll. All was tasty and the crew was very nice on a one hour flight. Cockpit informed about flight. Baggage took some while because Tegel Airport is way to small but this is not Air Berlins fault. Better than Germanwings since service is free of charge.
687,We travelled from KUL-ALA-LHR-ALA-KUL earlier this month. We were very pleasantly surprised by the high standard of service and attention given by the cabin crew on all sectors. The aircraft was reassuringly up to date and instead of built in entertainment system had iPad movies/TV at least in Business Class which anyway give a much better picture (and the choice of music is excellent too!). Quality of onboard food out of Almaty was a bit iffy however understood when one takes into account one is in Central Asia. This airline is a little gem and excellent value for money.
688,Bangkok - Astana Astana - Almaty Almaty - Istanbul. I have been flying Air Astana regularly for nearly 10 years. I think that they are the best airline in the Russian speaking world. My flights left and landed almost on time although we sat in the plane for an extended period of time in Ho Chi Min city and were not allowed off it. The food was good included the shortish flights between Almaty and Astana. The entertainment on the two long haul sectors was a bit limited. Cabin crew spoke quite good English - even on the internal sectors. Seats and legroom quite comfortable though the seats do not go horizontal on the long sectors. They provide good to reasonable value for money.
689,ASU-AEP morning flight on time clean and professional. Not many flights between Paraguay and Argentina and this one went into the city airport Aeroparque saving a lot of time.
690,I flew from Venice to Dublin on 24 Feb 2013. There was only one check-in agent for the entire flight. Venice Marco Polo airport is a nightmare to depart from as there are very few security desks and lots of flights. Queue for security was appalling and stretched out of the departure building! I stood in line for almost 2 hours and saw several flights between different groups of passengers from various countries. Small children and elderly people were very upset. As I stood in line my name was called for final boarding. I only just made it to the gate and saw that 3 other passengers were denied boarding. I was bussed out to the flight alone on a transfer bus. Flight was pretty full and departure delayed 45 mins - not the fault of Aer Lingus though. The seats were fine if cramped. Tea and a snack had to be paid for. The crew were very nice and worked hard. I am a QANTAS frequent flyer and opted for the Aer Lingus flight to gain some more points. I booked a Y class seat and yet have not been awarded any points at all by Qantas who blame Aer Lingus who in turn blame Qantas! The fare was not the cheapest as some rivals offered cheaper deals with a stop-over. I would use Aer Lingus again as I like their friendly staff. I feel that the check-in procedure at Venice needs to be examined and Aer Lingus ought to exert some pressure on the airport to improve the squalid experience in the airport.
691,Recently flew Cork - Lanzarote return. Both flights were on time and the service was excellent. Cabin crew very good particularly on return flight. Cabins were clean and tidy and Aer Lingus seems to have tightened up on the practice of allowing oversize baggage into the cabin. I had booked well in advance so price was quite reasonable. My usual gripe is with Cork Airport arrivals where the air bridges remain redundant and passengers have to brave the elements and 3 flights of stairs to get inside the airport building.
692,SVO-PVG. 767-300ER 45 mins delayed departure and arrival twice. Seating was ok personnel somewhat friendly only small central screen with Russian movie as inflight entertainment good food with drink rounds no rounds in between. Old style experience. Good price.
693,TLV-SVO-PEK return. TLV-SVO on time excellent ground service quick check-in. Aircraft a little bit old but well kept no entertainment but very nice and good service. SVO-PEK on time good transit arrangements A330-300 - new aircraft good service and meals. PEK- SVO on time B767 - again good service and meals. SVO-TLV - a long walk from arrival terminal to departure terminal very comfortable waiting area A330-300 - brand new aircraft good entertainment and very good crew service.
694,DUS-TXL-DUS. Attitude of AB ground-staff in DUS remains problematic. They are grumpy and arrogant. Crew on board okay. Very punctual and swift performance. Price (396 euro RTN for 4) included snack drink chocolate and 23 kg luggage. The only problem with AB is reliability. They cancelled the last two flights out of Berlin so we had to leave almost three hours earlier. Had a similar experience last year. On the other hand: definitely preferred AB above Germanwings because of constant strike risk.
695,Flight LED-ALA. The new aircraft in rather good condition although seats are very used in economy class. Sensible costs good service on board friendly crew and tasty meal. The traveler mini-bag was given consisted of toothbrush toothpaste a bandage for sleeping and a pair of socks. On-board entertainment was rather good also pillows for more comfort were provided by default. These airlines will be my choice for future trips to KZ.
696,Round trip HKG-ALA-SVO. Meals tasted good. Staff Service excellent both inside and outside the flight. Staff in transfer lounge nice and helpful. Before my return trip from SVO-HKG I had a flight from Riga to SVO with Aeroflot. When I arrived at ALA for transfer the staff of Air Astana suspected and asked if I had any checked luggage. I said I had and Aeroflot had already transferred it to Air Astana as they told me so. He said my luggage was not with the flight according to their record. He also went out to see if my luggage was at claim lounge. He couldn't find mine so took me to report lost baggage. 15 mins after reporting the loss I was waiting for my next flight in departure lounge. My luggage was found at SVO airport. Staff in transfer lounge were professional and helpful.
697,Plane from Auckland to Buenos Aires was old pocket at back of seat was split so mags etc kept falling out seats frayed and the nearest movie screen didn't work. Inflight service OK there doesn't seem to be a choice of meal and it is just plonked in front of one. But had plenty of room as plane was only half full. Return trip from Montivideo was hours late leaving for Buenos Aires. I had to take a bus to the international airport but as it wouldn't have arrived there till 0100 I had to take a car (shared with another traveller) for the 0200 flight which left at 0430! Plane was better than the first as everything seemed to work. Cabin staff do their job but not so friendly as other air lines. Lights out after dinner and don't see cabin staff much after that but there is water and drinks left in the galley area. Plane late into Auckland so therefore missed connection to Christchurch and had to buy another ticket as I had just got a non transferable thinking 3 hours between flights would be long enough. Air fare was about half the price of the other airline servicing that route. Not sure if I will use them again. Have to be aware of delays and we were not given any explanation as to why it was delayed.
698,BUE to MVD so very short flight. Excellent service very friendly staff. Even got a snack in a handy plastic bag to reuse at security next time - nice idea. On return from Montevideo arrived to check in and was offered a seat on a flight leaving one hour earlier. So great experience. Only negative was very complicated booking process. Booked online but then had to call the office here in France to make payment. Not possible either online or through Buenos Aires call centre. Very strange.
699,BOG to EZE on a relatively new 737. Flight left on time food decent (two services on this 6 hour flight lunch and snack before landing) although the main lunch was pretty small and all types of drinks free. This airline has a pretty bad reputation for being late but it seems they are buying new planes and things are getting slowly better. For me it was all I could ask for - cheap nonstop and good service. The only change would be to have some sort of in flight entertainment.
700,Business class #124 Chicago to Dublin very clean and new-feeling Airbus 330-300 fine staff very thoughtful and professional. The seat is very comfortable Recarro sport-type does not go fully flat but is very nice in all other conformations. Even though Aer Lingus doesn't match up with the fabulous seating/bedding of major liners they exceed the US carriers in other ways. We saved about $1500 versus those carriers and I felt it was a fine bargain. I'd fly them again for sure.
701,I flew from Berlin SchÃ¶nefeld (SXF) to Dublin (DUB). The flight lasted only 2 hours. The cabin was ok it was clean. The seat comfort was ok but not excellent. The staff service was excellent. The food was ok and the sky shop had a great selection. The inflight entertainment was ok but a bit boring.
702,SVO-DEL A330. First time with Aeroflot was a pleasant surprise. No trouble at all and a very professional service. Vegetarian meal had been ordered and was delivered without having to ask for it. On one leg the food was a disaster but on the return flight it was really good. Nice selection of games music and movies. Transfer at SVO very smooth nice connected terminals. Our cabin baggage was never measured even though its size was obviously very close to the limit.
703,Good value for money. New Airbus from Moscow to Tokyo food above average and entertainment system quite satisfying. Aeroflot has very strict rules when it comes to the baggage weight and size limits so try to have that in mind when travelling. They measure your bags and they will charge for every additional kilo or cm.
704,After reading quite a number of negative reviews I can not believe I actually flew Air Berlin. My flight from Zurich-Dusseldorf-Miami return in Business class was one of the most pleasurable flying experiences I have had. The planes were clean. The crews were efficient and kind. The food was plentiful and incredibly good. The seats are extremely comfortable. The entertainment is the best in the air. Overall Air Berlin is much better than KLM Air France British etc.
705,ZRH-DUS-JFK-BER-FRA with Air Berlin. On time flights with very friendly check in staff and cabin crew. I will use this company again.
706,Fly Air Astana once a week on average internal KZ and international. Consistent friendly service and generally very punctual. Last flight Almaty to Atyrau business class. Boarding always a mess but once on board great service. Occasionally poor attention to regulations with people on mobile phones while taking off and landing but generally getting better.
707,Buenos Aires to Bariloche return and found both the airplane comfortable and the crew very attentive. The snack and beverage services were nice too. There was a delay in the departure from Bariloche to Buenos Aires which seems to be usual in Aerolineas Argentinas. It is said that many passengers choose some other airlines instead of Aerolineas because of the habitual delays. I hope it will become more efficient and competitive in time.
708,SYD-AKL return. Staff pleasant and polite. Food edible if you are hungry. A good budget airline seats in good condition and comfortable. Only downside would be no in flight entertainment. It wouldn't kill them to put on a movie especially during school holidays.
709,"Seat room in economy is tight on the return flight (7 hours 20 mins) our baggage was mistakenly brought to the cargo area instead of baggage claim. We were given no explanation as to why after an hour our bags were still not dispensed. The staff had no idea even where the bags were! After 1 hr 45 mins we were told what happened and that ""we at least know where the bags are"". Exhausted after now a total of 10 hrs a meal voucher was given out when all we wanted was the be on our way! The whole experience was handled very poorly!"
710,I flew from JFK to Dublin in June. Everything went extremely smoothly from luggage check in to luggage pick up. The personnel on the ground and on board was extremely friendly and efficient. The only drawback of the airline is the food selection and quality.
711,Boston to Dublin onboard an Airbus 330. A very warm welcome from the Irish crew members upon boarding the aircraft. Soon after takeoff we were served beverage service and then our main dinner course of which was up to high standards. The main course consisted of chicken or beef. A very tasty meal. The crew members were all welcoming and served the passengers with full courtesy and friendliness. I have to say the crew always work hard on these flights and are a pleasure to have on board. I definitely will be flying with them in the near future.
712,Oslo-Moscow economy. New A320 fine leg space attentive cabin crew with decent English skills light meal. Moscow-Bangkok economy. New A330 excellent leg space good cabin crew fine meals individual screens with decent selection of movies. On the return from Hong Kong to Moscow the B767 was visibly old and needed refurbishment it lacked individual entertainment systems.
713,NUE-DUS-CUR Return. Dash 8/A330-200. Air Berlin has a good product in Economy Class. Good IFE for Long haul flights. Seat Comfort and Pitch are acceptable. AB seems to hire a rather mature Cabin Crew. This translates in a professional cabin service which is not always friendly per se. Main issue is the provision of refreshments on the IC flights. Two meals are provided;1 warm meal two hours into the flight and the second cold (and small) approximately 60 min before landing. This was the same for in/outbound. This means no refreshments or snacks for approximately 6-8hours!! So BYO! In addition make sure you select a low row number 1-35 rows in the back of the aircraft cannot select meals and get whatever is left. Meals are rather poor in quantity and quality. Note that AB is a semi-LCC though with mostly regular fares. This could explain the poor Food and Beverage service. Flights were all remarkably on time.
714,Short haul internal flight from Berlin to Munich and return - 27th Dec. Have flown with this carrier on a number of occasions in recent times on both short and long haul flights. Have found them to provide a very good level of service on all occasions. This flight was short duration with no in flight entertainment and provision of only a light refreshment. Seats satisfactory for short haul only and legroom tight in comparison to long haul aircraft. Unable to be seated together despite early booking for group of 6. However given the short flight any inconveniences were minor - no complaints. Long haul evaluation just below level of Etihad/Emirates/V Aust. Have used and will happily continue to use and recommend this carrier.
715,ALA-KZO. return. Service was pleasant and efficient. Very polite and professional staff onboard. Food was good but could have been a little better.
716,Frankfurt-Astana June 1 2013. Economy class. Full house. A bit of a mess at the gate at Frankfurt due to the airline's boarding policy last rows board first. Most people did not know or did not understand this so they waited for their turn as close to the gate agent as possible and as a consequence there was some pushing. Left with a delay of 10 minutes. Very hard working and helpful crew they spoke good English and were always around offering something. Economy passengers received a comfort kit somehow basic but still a nice touch. Inflight entertainment is pre-historic small flat screens hanging from the roof every few metres showing just one film and a couple of cartoons. Drink service several choices including alcohol. Meal service with two options fish or chicken. Nice cheesecake for dessert. Finally after the trays had been collected crew served vanilla ice cream. Although the flight took almost 6 hours with an arrival time of 6 am no breakfast was served. Coffee or tea would have been appreciated especially given the 2 hour immigration queue at Astana upon landing. Overall a more than acceptable experience. I would not hesitate to recommend this airline.
717,Astana to Frankfurt and back in May 2013. We flew with a large group of small children. Airport staff were helpful with check-in and we were allowed to board first. Cabin staff were very helpful and friendly and dealt well with our kids (handed out children's packs on the way out for example.) Food was good quality and there were films showing throughout the plane (no individual at-seat screens in economy though). A pleasant experience overall!
718,Buenos Aires to Calafate economy class. Food and drinks were reasonable. Cabin interior was clean. On return the aircraft was MD80 legroom reasonable but as no entertainment service on this 3 hour flight.
719,We flew to and from Madrid and we left and arrived on time. Both trips take about 11 hours and the experience was good. The seat is confortable though it is not a flat bed and the food was good. The plane was a rather old B747.
720,Sydney to Auckland. No inflight entertainment just a snack and drinks service and good legroom which Aerolineas have on the A340. Friendly and engaging crew. Overall a good flight and very cheap ticket.
721,Buenos Aires to Sydney via Auckland. Staff were efficient and friendly enough. The food was fine leg room pretty good. Buenos Aires to Auckland after dinner the lights go off and you do not see the staff often after that but water was left out on the tray. TVs only in the centre aisle but audio was in English. Blankets and pillows on the seat. The plane had been around for years though. A negative is at the boarding lounge gate you handheld baggage is searched and they took all my wife's makeup and threw it away they should have provided plastic bags because it needed to be in an individual bag and she was very upset about this.
722,Flight was cancelled recently from Shannon to Manchester 25.1.13. However Aer Lingus took the strain they organised overnight stay in a hotel and booked us onto the next flight the next day. Staff were excellent and could have not done more for us in a difficult situation.
723,Dublin - Lanzarote 20 Dec return 03 Jan. I have travelled a lot with Aer Lingus and it seems they have moved away from the very low cost type of airline back to what they were. Was seated in row 2D adequate space (I'm 6ft 1). Crew very good as always and its nice to see the mature crew menders on board. I do have one gripe - Aer Lingus have a fantastic Deli/Pay Menu its a pity they never have any of the stock this is my 8th time since July with Aer Lingus where the stocks run out by the time the trolley hits row 2. I complained to the senior cabin crew member - she said agreed - that its always happening to them. Would still use them again no problem.
724,Did my usual Christmas route LHR-SNN-LHR. All in all it was a great flight no delays staff were extremely friendly as always check-in was simple and they also offered to check in my carry on luggage free of charge. If Aer Lingus flew from Stansted I'd fly with them anytime I was going home.
725,SVO-MUC. I didn't expect too much and therefore I was really surprised by the airline and the new terminal at Sheremetyevo airport. The crew members were friendly and could speak good English. Very good hot meal and comfortable seats. I was very satisfied.
726,TXL-AUH return. My second long haul flight with Air-Berlin and as before can't understand the bad comments on this forum. No worse or better than most other European airlines. A330 aircraft on both legs. Flights bang on time great IFE with lots of choices good quality screen and an OK price. Seat is also as comfortable (or non- comfortable) as on other European airlines such as Lufthansa and KLM. On the negative side: both Berlin Tegel and Abu-Dhabi airports are horrible - both outdated too small and boarding was a nightmare on both. That is not an Air-Berlin problem or fault. What is however Air Berlin's fault is the stupidity in the way we boarded in Tegel buses taking us to the aircraft and passengers boarding an A330 from both the front and rear gates without taking into account seat numbers. Result was dozens of people trying to go past each other in opposite directions in the middle of the aircraft - the most brainless way to board such a large aircraft that I have ever experienced. Other than that nothing to shout or not shout about and will use them again.
727,Berlin - Madeira - Berlin. Very friendly crew on both flights including regular updates on flight status. Compared to Germanwings all passengers still get free drinks (2 rounds alcoholic beverages are not included) a rather tasty sandwich and then some chocolate later. Space is also ok. So while the service has declined over the years (no more free magazines) Air Berlin still offers better service than most other charter carriers plus the friendly staff made both flights very enjoyable. The only thing I would criticise is that although they show even a movie on this flight you need to purchase headsets which in the end nobody did (yes they are only 3 Euro but giving those out for free would be nice).
728,7 hour flight from Almaty to Bangkok this month and it was very comfortable. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful without being overbearing. The spacing between the rows of seats was very large the seats reclined quite far back. Even though there were no indivdual tv screens for each seat we were each given ipads preloaded with movies which was a brilliant idea. You didn't have a huge choice of movies but most of the recent blockbuster releases were there along with some international movies. Overall it was a very pleasant flight and I would definitely choose to fly with Air Astana again.
729,Dushanbe - Almaty in business class. A Western standard experience including attentive and friendly cabin crew and excellent food. On time departure and arrival. This short trip was a relaxing moment in a busy day plus got some work done in the spacious seat. The seat armrest was broken though so hopefully a repair was due just after this flight.
730,I frequently fly with Air Astana mostly within Kazakhstan and sometimes abroad. Air Astana is the best airline in Kazakhstan in terms of comfort and service. Luckily I have not had major delays and those which I had were usually weather related. Flight attendants were friendly and professional good aircraft's better legroom choice of food and entertainment helpful customer service. Overall very good progress in the last 5-7 years and dramatically improved flying experience if compared with its predecessor airlines just around 10 years ago.
731,Almaty to Hong Kong and back. It was smooth no delays. 757 of Air Astana?™s fleet has good business class with quite comfortable seats - almost flat. Good food and service. Inflight entertainment is ok they provide Ipads which is quite convenient.
732,Auckland to Buenos Aires. Plane was delayed by five hours after we'd checked in with pretty much no explanation (except that the incoming plane from Sydney was delayed but again no explanation why). We were travelling with two young children so the delays were a bit difficult. Legroom was pretty much as I remember other airlines in economy class. The lack of decent entertainment was a pain (only the old monitors up in the aisles where you had to crane your neck to see) but the kids ended up falling asleep anyway. And the movie they played was in Spanish. Dinner was acceptable. Kids had a kids meal as requested. It was disappointing there was no beverage service during the night for those who were awake. I went hunting for a drink of water hoping they'd give me a bottle to tide me over but no just a cup. Having said all that the staff were reasonably friendly and the fare was much cheaper. It saved us around $1200 as a family. So if you don't mind no-frills it's not a bad choice. The domestic leg from Buenos Aires to Lima was on time and efficient.
733,Unexpectedly excellent. Did exactly what was required (LHR-ORK-LHR) affordable smilingly and on time. Can't ask for more than that these days.
734,Dublin - JFK on Dec 17 2012. The cabin crew were warm and helpful. I hadn't requested a vegetarian meal but the stewardess was nice enough to bring me extra salads and rolls. They came by often with drink service and to collect trash. The movies and shows available were great. I'm a very nervous flyer and as we were preparing to land a stewardess talked me through it and was very comforting.
735,Flying from a regional airport in Germany to Dublin at Christmas time over the past few years I have usually tended to use Lufthansa usually transiting via Frankfurt. However in 2012 I chose instead to connect via London Gatwick on the outbound and London Heathrow on the inbound UK parts of the journey. Boarding the flight for Dublin at London Gatwick I was struck by the friendly Irish humour when asked by the flight attendant whether the wrapped Christmas present in my open carry-on bag was for her! That set the tone for the flight and indeed the Christmas season! It just shows how much a friendly crew can add or detract from the flight experience. Aer Lingus offered a professional and friendly service throughout with surprisingly comfortable seats. Did not purchase any inflight catering or make any other purchases given the very short duration of the journey. T2 at Dublin was impressive and although there was a mishap with my luggage on arrival the matter was sorted efficiently and to my satisfaction. I will be using Aer Lingus again in a few months time and looking forward to it.
736,Flew JFK to Dublin on December 26 2012. Check in was fast boarding was smooth and the flight was pleasant to Dublin. Flew back January 6 2013 Dublin to JFK. Check in immigration and customs pre- clearance boarding were all smooth. The only issue and this is most likely not an Aer Lingus issue was the ridiculous walk from the plane to pick up baggage. Perhaps this was due to ongoing construction at the terminal. If not I feel for anyone that has trouble walking.
737,SVO-CPH. First time with Aeroflot and would avoid in the future. Surly and unpleasant cabin crew. Very average food and almost incomprehensible announcements in English. Fortunately the flight was only just over two hours.
738,Beijing Capital International to London Heathrow via Moscow. The staff were great. The seats were of average comfort for economy and the inflight entertainment was great with a choice of films and games. The only drawback to this flight is the lack of alcohol (and the choice of drinks is indeed rather limited). However that was the only issue I found and it wasn't too much of a problem. Also navigating my way from the old terminal to my next flight was fine too.
739,Paid a low price for flight Paris-Tokyo (with a stopover at Moscow). First leg Paris-Moscow was very good. A new airbus with comfortable seats helpful and smiling staff full bar service and good food. No flight entertainment. Transfer at SVO was ok. Moscow-Tokyo was not delayed. While food and onboard staff were nice the plane a Boeing 767 was falling apart. Flight entertainment was a Russian dubbed copy of Home Alone in one of the few screens that would pop out here and there. The second leg was a brand new A330 with new seats individual screens more than 50 films to choose from full bar service and great food. Staff were friendly and English speaking. Great value for money and I strongly recommend it.
740,ZRH-DUS-MIA and return in business class. Short flights okay (only coach class but they kept the seat next to me free). Business class seats fully flat really great if you sleep on the side (otherwise might be a bit short) staff extremely friendly meals rather uninspired (I had a pre-ordered vegetarian meal). Entertainment has a nice selection however I slept most of the time. Would fly with Air Berlin in business class.
741,Flew an A330-200 from JFK to DUS in economy. The flight was about 25 minutes late taking off (good by most standards). Food was average service was average although the staff came across as a bit unfriendly. The inflight entertainment system was excellent (there were a wide range of up-to-date shows movies and music to select from). However the seats were the most uncomfortable I've ever flew in. My knees were literally pressed up against the seat ahead of me the entire flight. No legroom whatsoever. On the whole nothing to shout about but not the worst either.
742,Flew from Almaty to Istanbul and was greeted by friendly helpful staff on both the outward and inward journeys. I am a tall person and I asked at check in for a seat with lots of leg room and was asked if I wanted to sit by the emergency exit. As a consequence my journeys were wonderful lots of leg room and helpful staff.
743,KC902- flight from London to Astana. No delay at all. The seat was quite comfortable staff service excellent I was served some traditional Kazakhstan food and it was delicious. There wasn't much inflight entertainment. This airline is the best way to access Kazakhstan.
744,Almaty to Bangkok return. Everything ran on time (slightly ahead of time actually) and service was up to the usual AA high standards. I was offered a free upgrade to Business Class on the return (overnight) trip which was very much appreciated - I slept solidly throughout the journey and felt surprisingly fresh on arrival.
745,Dublin to London. I am a frequent global business traveller and was very impressed. Especially impressed with the friendliness of the cabin crew who were professional and helpful! Will definitely travel with them again.
746,LHR-SNN return over the New Year period. Two excellent flights both leaving and arriving early. Ok they have 'add-ons' at the time of booking but they are transparent about it and the luggage allowance is generous. In my view they are the best airline to travel on to/from Ireland. Have been travelling with them for over 25 years and they have been consistently good.
747,Flew JFK to DUB return in J for the holidays. Check in at JFK is quick and easy and the oasis lounge is comfortable well stocked and quiet. What sets Aer Lingus apart is the friendly crew and to warm genuine Irish welcome on boarding . Although it was a full overnight flight the crew provided excellent service with generous drinks top ups and above average J food. The almost flat bed is reasonably comfortable for the length of flight. I only managed an hours sleep as its a short hop over the pond. Nice continental breakfast towels and proper tea before landing. Bags off first and overall excellent value. Return leg on the 105 on New Years Eve was excellent. Friendly J check in with no wait new T2 lounge quiet and the benefits of pre-flight clearance in Dublin are immeasurable. Again great crew generous drinks good food and warm smiles.
748,Amsterdam to Hanoi via Moscow. The first flight delayed an hour making me miss the connecting flight in Moscow to Hanoi. Had to spend the night in the airport hotel. The next day I had to fly to Beijing wait 5 hrs and finally catch my flight to Vietnam. All in all I was delayed 34 hrs. Onboard staff were not very friendly and their English pretty bad. The food was average and seats and inflight entertainment adequate for economy class.
749,"LED-SVO and KZN-SVO-LED. All flights on A320 and A321 aircraft. Extremely comfortable seating onboard all flights. Cabin and flight deck crews seemed to have excellent English skills although all 3 flights were domestic Russian ones. Aircraft clean transfer at SVO extremely easy in a new facility. On each flight served a ""lunch box"" style snack with a croissant or sandwich and a carton of apple juice in addition to a full bar service. Punctual flights and quick baggage reclaim. I am a member of KLM's Flying Blue frequent flyer programme and the miles for these flights were added quickly within a few days of travel. Only issue was that the first flight had been rescheduled and only a telephone call to Aeroflot in Moscow could confirm this - they did not try to contact me first."
750,BCN-Moscow-Shanghai return. You really get what you pay for. The transfer at Sheremetyevo is not the most pleasant - old-fashioned counters rude staff with poor English skills. Onboard everything gets better - seat width and food is not that bad but you better bring music and books with you as entertainment is zero. Return flight much better on the newest Airbus A330 a long 10 hours flight. Luggage arrived intact. Altogether a great choice if you are on a budget.
751,Flew an A330 from Berlin to Miami - I enjoyed the food I am 6 ft 2 and I had enough leg room. It was a little tight when the person in front reclined all the way. The entertainment was the best system I have seen lots of movies TV games and the map including flight data.
752,ALA-BKK on 13th February 2013 returning on 17th February 2013. Offered a business class upgrade on boarding. The flat bed seats were brilliant for an overnight flight as was the meal drinks selection and level of customer service. A relaxing journey which went quickly due to the level of comfort and service. On the return journey I was in the economy seat I had originally purchased. I slept almost all the way and with my seat fully reclined I was able to stretch my legs out fully. There was certainly more legroom available than on other airlines I have flown into and out of Almaty and Kazakhstan itself. The meal was a lovely Thai chicken curry. The service was great and the drinks trolley was always in service.
753,PEK-ALA-SVO. Both flights arrived on time. Good food and excellent alcohol selection. Service friendly and efficient. PEK-ALA on 767 and ALA-SVO on 321 old but well maintained. Generous legroom. No individual entertainment. Overall very good value for money.
754,Return flight from KL to ALA was in complete contrast to the previous flight down. On time crew very friendly and professional. Food and service was very good. After the debacle of the previous flight the agent in KL met me at the gate to again apologise. He had been very helpful previously. I also received an e-mail from the company's senior operations manager who went to lengths to apologise and explain. I do feel this is more than most airlines would do to follow up. This does give confidence that the airline is focussed on continuous improvement. The entertainment unit also had more movies loaded and this kept me fully occupied and well entertained for the flight. However suffice to say that the experience on the return journey was a good one with very good service and perfectly on time with the plane unloading from an air bridge on arrival making unloading of the 767 much more efficient.
755,SEN-DUB-SEN: First time travelling with this airline and have to say very impressed. Booking check-in all very straight forward only problem is had to queue along with other passengers at Southend Airport as no separate bag drop for online check in pax. Flight on time and first time in ATR42 aircraft. Very comfortable seating even with bags under seat in front of you. Allocated seating and not being treated like cattle is a big thumbs up from me. With this airline and Southend airport it has bought my faith back in commercial aviation. Would definitely use Air Lingus Regional again.
756,Flew DUB-JFK-DUB in Business on A330. Both flights were excellent with attentive staff good food and top- ups of drinks whenever you wanted. Staff did not disappear into galleys during either daytime or night time legs. IFE is very good with a good choice of up to date movies. There was a problem with this on the return and they only managed to get the outbound movies shown. The lie-almost-flat seat was very comfortable and enabled me to sleep for a couple of hours. Both legs were on time.
757,JFK to Moscow to VVO. New Airbus planes in good condition. Efficient staff and interesting hot meals. All flights on time. Baggage handling in Moscow and Vladivostok was incredibly fast. Very satisfied.
758,Brussels-Moscow-Tokyo return on A320 and Boeing 767-300ER. A very decent choice if you are on a budget the negative aspects of the travel being related to the airport. The crew did not smile much with poor English skills. Drinks and food came often on SVO-NRT. IFE is very poor on the 767-300.
759,"HKG-SVO. Overall good flight but service could have been better for business class. Old looking cabin on A300. FA's older and quite reserved. No repeat servings and one had to ask for a drink refill. Catering good from HKG and meal very tasty. Seat comfort is ok but not designed for taller person. Priority luggage tags mean nothing with Aeroflot almost for sure your ""priority"" tagged luggage will show up last! Result was 55 mins wait at the luggage belt for delivery. SVO airport F terminal chaos at customs as usual."
760,"JFK-DUS DUS-ZRH TXL-MUC MUC-DUS DUS-JFK. From reading all these reviews before my trip I was a bit nervous but actually my trip turned out awesome! I took five Air Berlin flights on my 3 week vacation and not one of them was an issue. Even my bag arrived with me! All flights were on time served pretty decent food and the flight attendants were friendly. We got served chicken or pasta on the long haul flight and croissants or chips on the short haul. The legroom especially on the A330-200 was tight even for a 5' 3"" person like me but it was a manageable. If you're tall you might have a problem. Each seat on the A330 is equipped with a personal inflight entertainment with a good selection of games and movies. When you select a seat on the A330 choose an even number because you'll have a full window instead of sitting between two halves of one. My only problem was the boarding process. Too many people were pushing and shoving when their group is called and the airline changed a gate in MUC without notifying us. Overall my experience was good much better than an US airline. I would definitely fly Air Berlin again!"
761,KC907/8 DEL-ALA-DEL on Y class. The Flex fare reasonably priced. Check in both at DEL and ALA was good. Minimal waiting times and the staff were very professional. Board process was ok. Slightly let down by the fact that we were bussed to aircraft and made to board via steps in the rain. Both flights were on well kept clean A320s. Flights were relatively empty so I had 3 seats to myself. Cabin Crew were pleasant and professional. Food and Drink was tasty well presented appropriate for route and time of day. IFE from drop down screens were a bit of a disappointment and hard to follow. Better off bringing a book. Punctual departure and arrival. Would fly again and recommend to others.
762,ALA-TSB - Emb 190 Business. Early morning business flight. All on time and aircraft full on this relatively new route. Crew were friendly and breakfast was very nice. Departure formalities from Almaty are confusing and bizarre with no priority for business class at any stage apart from check in. No Air Astana staff to guide you through the complexities rather there are hawkers trying to make some cash who are more of a hindrance. Lounge is horrid not even 2* let alone 4*. No priority boarding for business class. Hand held TV offered but I didn't use it. Would happily fly Air Astana again.
763,TSE-CIT-ALA. A couple of internal Kazak flights. All on time. Clean and comfortable. Leg room good on both flights. Crews fine but seemed to be little interest in standard health and safety (eg phones ringing in flight people walking around the aircraft during taxi). Did a good job but not a 4* airline!
764,22nd November Dublin to Orlando. Business Class. Excellent service and cabin crew. Timekeeping excellent. Hope return flight on 19th January is as good!
765,Flew ORK-FAO with them. Great service and flight time even if it is a bit early at 6.40am. Food is excellent and not too expensive. Cabin crew are professional and friendly. Aircraft Airbus A320 was 5 years old and was very clean and tidy. Fare was good 120 euro return cheaper by 30 than Ryanair however they are far superior to fly with and are very lenient with bag weight. Pity they do not fly more services into Shannon like SNN- MUN SNN-BCN and SNN-AMS. these would do very well for business and leisure people.
766,LHR-Cork in Nov. Checked in online very easily. Flight was quick to board cabin crew were friendly and the seats were comfy. Cork-LHR was delayed 1.5 hours due to poor weather conditions at LHR we were updated frequently by EI staff. Once the a/c arrived they were very quick to board us and again the service was brilliant.
767,Helsinki-SVO-Havana. The flight went surprisingly well the plane was new lots of entertainment options even a USB port below the screen. The staff were not smiling just like at Moscow airport. The flight was on time and 40% cheaper than others doing the same route.
768,London Heathrow-Tokyo via Moscow with A320 and B767 even though being informed that Moscow-Tokyo would be the latest A330. The meals throughout the flights were good with all hot meals. No entertainment (even music) available on A320. No individual monitor available on B767. Seat and cabin interior definitely need refurbishment. Even though seat on B767 was very tired it had deeper reclining and was softer than some of other airlines. The cabin crews were friendly. Will fly with them again.
769,NYC-SVO-KBP on A330-300 and A321. Prior to the flight newspapers were distributed. We were then stuck in a jam while taxiing prior to take-off. Service onboard was plain and overall very correct. I have low interest in IFE though the little I tried seemed quite correct. We were served dinner and breakfast the former with wine. We arrived on time. The transfer went smoothly and the second leg was as pleasant as the other. The fare was 30-40% cheaper than on other airlines doing the route. Great value for money and solid level of quality.
770,BUD-SVO-DEL with quite new A330-300. All flights were on time. Onboard service was great. Comfortable seats and great entertainment lot of movies music and games. Meals were lovely on BUD-SVO flight - cold meal with two drinks juice and coffee/tea. On SVO-DEL flight warm meal was served - they gave us menu before dinner so we could choose. Lot of drinks served. Cabin staff can be more polite.
771,Flew from Dusseldorf to JFK. A330 service in Business class. I often fly BA Virgin and Singapore Airlines transatlantic. I have to say I thought Air Berlin were just as good (admittedly SIA use A380's on the JFK- Frankfurt run and are a little roomier). I thought the seat was very good (I was in 2A). The food was good and the entertainment system was good although I think Virgin wins that one. Flight was on time despite a big headwind. I will definitely fly them again and love the fact I can avoid Heathrow and use my Avios points.
772,Service was good provide travel kits headsets entertainment programs excellent but during boarding I was frustrated by rude attitude of flight attendants one flight attendant gave us instructions about emergency exits we set in front and two other crew came to me and asked me if I was instructed or not about emergency exit because I had small bag in my hands. She raised her voice was very aggressive didn't ask me but said firmly that I must change my seat. Then went away to business class returned with flight attendant-supervisor who said it was ok for me to keep my bag in my hands and was very sorry about this situation. I think the crew need more training (working with passengers and working in a team).
773,Moscow-Almaty-Bangkok. Both flights departed on time. Flight attendants helpful and friendly with reasonable English. Food was good and sufficient. IFE's a bit restricted and out of date for Business Class. Big problems in Almaty because I could not produce the credit card used for the booking. Took several hours of work and an email from a bank in Australia before I was allowed to board the flight. Flight full from Moscow to Almaty and only a third full from Almaty to Bangkok. Despite the problems with credit cards I will still fly them.
774,KUL-ALA-AKX return. First flight from KUL-ALA on their 767-300 flight was on time and service was great. But for a 7 hour flight it was quite hot in the cabin. Had some trouble with my visa-on-arrival in Almaty but the ground crew were very helpful translating throughout the immigration process: they even carried my bags and checked them in for my connecting flight while I was waiting for my visa. Flights from ALA-AKX and return were good got on their new Embraer and the service onboard was excellent though the crew does need improvements their English. Overall it was a great experience and would like to fly them again.
775,Roundtrip MCO-DUB-MCO. November 10-17 2012. A330-200 was clean the seats were comfortable the inflight entertainment system was excellent the food acceptable and the cabin crew attentive. We paid the extra $100US round-trip per person for bulkhead/emergency row seating. It was well worth it. Row 11 A/C has excellent legroom. A draw back is that the entertainment monitor is between the seat and has to fold up as there is no seat in front of you. I would recommend Aer Lingus in the future.
776,Glasgow to Orlando via Dublin. Excellent service for the second time this year. The short flight Glasgow to Dublin is on a prop plane but is perfectly adequate for the short distance. Dublin-Orlando includes good entertainment food and most courteous cabin crew. A330 was very clean.
777,Madrid-Moscow-Shanghai. Madrid-Moscow flight new and spacious A321 no inflight entertainment food ok but drinks only served before the meal and not with the meal. Good connection in Moscow. Moscow-Shanghai on Airbus 330-200 good inflight entertainment best row is 24 with more leg space. The seats on the side are more expensive but the ones in the middle are free of charge. Same problem with drinks here. Return flights the same I would recommend - good value for money.
778,LHR-SVO-PVG returning PEK-SVO-LHR. Nice A321 to Moscow with good meal. Sheveremeteyvo Airport Terminals DE and F now interlinked though website states still bus link. B767's are old and on boarding it was noticeable that the interior had not been refurbished. Once airborne the service and food excellent. The seats were comfortable and the overhead TV had some good films. Return flight from Beijing on new Airbus A330-300 very pleasant and comfortable. Good personal seatback entertainment system with very wide screens for economy class. Lots of choice though some movies not up to date. Food good again. A321 to LHR only half full cabin crew pleasant and attentive food fine and only problem was that cabin lights not dimmed for night flight.
779,Return flight London Heathrow to Moscow Sheremetyevo. The outward flight started off good. We left on time and the plane was new and comfortable. The food is of a good standard. However once we landed at Sheremetyevo it was a whole other story. Due to weather we had to wait just yards away from our gate because there was ice on the ground. The plane was very stuffy and I think it took an extra half an hour until we finally stopped at our taxi gate. On the inward flight it was much better. Very quick and comfortable.
780,CPT-GBE GBE-JNB. First flight a clean Bae146 in very good condition half empty with loads of leg room. Food excellent for an airline and service find. Second flight on an equally clean ATR72 with equally good snacks. All flights on time. Much prefer them to SAX or Airlink!
781,Return from Faro to Dusseldorf. Check-in in Faro was quick even with only 2 check in counters open. Got seats in back of the plane. Check-in staff nice. Plane boarding was quick and not a hassle and on time. Take off on time. Service on board was great very nice crew. Got one coffee one water and one nice beer for some change. Free movie shown on overhead screens and again a lot of legroom. Cockpit crew provided us with nice information like seeing Paris at night from the sky. We stopped on the tarmac so deplaning was via bus to terminal which took about 45 minutes due to bus queue on terminal. Baggage took about 1 hour before on the belt. With out that mishap Air Berlin is a great airline.
782,Bangkok to Almaty. Excellent flight friendly and helpful flight attendants. Cabin crews English is getting better and more than adequate for a foreigner travelling with them. Food was good but could have been a little better. Seats good - not quite a bed but allow you to stretch and sleep. Portable hand held entertainment units not so good compared with other airlines. I upgraded at airport and this represents excellent value. Pre-booked business class is not good value.
783,ALA-AYT-ALA. Very polite and professional staff onboard. Excellent serving of special meals as ordered at booking and excellent care for children and aged passengers. I would recommend providing more toiletries (hand lotion combs etc). If possible please consider other supplier of noise-reducing earplugs those available in the passenger's pouch now don't reduce the noise and pressure discomfort in the cabin.
784,Excellent recent flights great selection from inflight service. Very friendly attentive and polite staff. Flights were on time and very comfortable good connections modern aircraft and all in all a great flying experience.
785,Four flights IST-ALA-TSE-ALA-KUL. All 4 were on time excellent service by cabin crew very good food and drink selection - both on domestic and international legs. Good seat comfort (cradle seats on shorter sectors angled lie flat on B767 to KUL). The only disappointment was the lounge in ALA which is basically a bar and you get a voucher for a soft drink plus a snack.
786,Business class to Beijing return from Almaty. Service was good and staff friendly. Better food better wines even cold champagne now. Staff are the airlines asset. They are informative polite and helpful.
787,Cardiff to Dublin evening 11th November. ATR72 looked relatively new bright interior due to LED lights. Seating very cramped more than other ATR 72's I have flown bearable for one hour. The first and second rows have facing seats which were occupied by 2 drunk women. They managed to buy a round of drinks from the drinks trolley and continue their celebrations. The landing was smooth and on time we turned off the runway quickly to reach the stand. Whilst waiting to disembark one of women wore the pilot's jacket as her friend took photographs All the action should be captured on the plane's CCTV. Certainly a different form of in flight entertainment!
788,Milan - Dublin - New York and back. All the flights were on time at departures and arrived at destination before scheduled. The crew were professional and friendly and the flights uneventful. The A320 have very comfortable seats economy A330 is a bit short of space for long haul flights but inflight entertainment and the service were ok considering the low fare paid.
789,JFK-SVO-CDG and SVO-JFK. A330 New York-Moscow excellent new and seats were good (2x4x2). Travelling with my wife it was convenient to have the seats to ourselves without someone else next to us. A320 Paris-Moscow just okay nothing extraordinary but not bad (3x3 seating LCD screens in the row). Personal IFE with good selection of movies in Russian and English on JFK-SVO. They served a hot meal with alcoholic beverages plus usual assortment of soft drinks even on flight Moscow to Paris. As someone who'd flown Aeroflot over the past 20 years they have changed for the better over the last couple of years - and are by far the cheapest option to fly from NY to Moscow.
790,"Peking-Munich in Business. A good experience. New A330/A 319 planes clean and good seats. New lie-flat seat on 330 wasn't really flat but perfectly fine for a daytime flight. The real surprise was the 319 which has ""proper"" business class seats even on this short three-hour flight (i.e. four seats in a row rather than the usual six seats with the middle seat kept free). Good selection of food and drinks. Plenty of IFE (about 50 movies to choose from and on-demand even on the short-haul sector). Most staff didn't speak too much English but perfectly fine to get the job done. The only letdown was Moscow airport. Yes the terminal building has been refurbished to international standards but the many uniformed people barking at you in Russian and the organisational chaos are still a nuisance. No customer service culture there. I chose Aeroflot on price and got very good value for money."
791,Fantastic Service. Booked from Australia for Jo'burg to Maun flight. Kept great communications for any changes and even transferred me on a SA flight no extra charge for my Kasane-Jo'burg leg when I explained about connection time with my Qantas flight due to schedule changes without having to be asked and emailed me back a new booking. Great service nice snack on a short leg clean modern plane on time friendly ground staff. I hear things might have been different a few years back but certainly my experience was very good and would fly with them again.
792,Francistown - Johannesburg 16 September. Good short flight efficiently run with good crew. On time and no problems.
793,In August Johannesburg to Maun and Kisane to Johannesburg. Both flights were spot on time. Service on board was fine with drinks and light snacks served for the roughly 2 hour flight in each direction. Aircraft's were in good shape and the seats comfortable for this type of trip. Check-in in Jo'burg was easy and very quick. Check- in in Kisane was a breeze as the airport is tiny. All in a good experience and a great way to enhance your Botswana experience.
794,Flew Dusseldorf to Faro Portugal. Check-in in Dusseldorf was really nice got seats in row 9 with window. Check-in staff nice and polite and helpful. Plane boarding was quick and not a hassle and on time. Take off just 10 minutes late due to emergency landing of a 4U plane. Service on board was great very nice crew. Service with the Sansibar-Snack was nice we got a Currywurst with roll and two nice bottle of Pommery champagne for a little extra but it was nice to have that. Free movie shown on overhead screens and a lot of legroom. Cockpit crew provided us with nice information. We got jetbridge at Faro so deplaning was nice and smooth again. Baggage was on time on the belt. So this is a great airline.
795,Aug 23 from JFK to TXL and again on Sep 03 from TXL to JFK. Our Eastbound take-off was delayed 2.25 hours due to ??mechanical difficulties but the flight going back to JFK arrived a few minutes early. AB has a problem with space which is in short supply. I am average height and weight yet I could not walk in the aisles without turning sideways. A passenger in front me on the Eastbound flight reclined her seat and made the space issue more critical. Seats are narrow and seat belts date back to 1968. Staff are friendly and polite but refuse to recognize that some passengers do not understand German. Food quality surpassed my expectations saluting the American Cuisine on the Eastbound portion. The meal quality on the Westbound portion surpassed that of Business Class food on other carriers!
796,Flew from Muenster Osnabrueck to Corfu 2nd August and returned 6th September 2014. As we had our dog and dog box we found the service by Air Berlin staff at both airports very helpful and my family are grateful for this service. We travel every year to Corfu for a long summer holiday and certainly shall use Air Berlin again.
797,Almaty-Astana return and Almaty-Abu Dhabi and all flights were fine. Check-in cabin service average food basic no delays. The Abu Dhabi flight was in an A320 though so entertainment and facilities were limited. It's like a lesser western airline but they do seem well-organised and have a good website. The only problem I had was caused by Etihad. I booked a codeshare through the Etihad website as it was the same price but included a bus to Dubai. However the bus departure time on my ticket did not exist and had never existed. I had to wait 3 hrs for a bus. If they had provided accurate information I would have made alternate arrangements.
798,Almaty to London. The service was pleasant and efficient KCTV was handed out as soon as seat belt signs went out so the time waiting for drinks to be served passed quickly by. As for the new wine selection this is good now that imported wines are included. The change from my first flight (Nov 2007) to now is positive.
799,GUW-TSE-SVO. I flew for business in Economy class and was impressed how professional the service was. The food is ok there was IFE via a small flip-down video screen and headsets were handed out to all passengers in time. During the flight from TSE to SVO they issued a travel pack (flight socks blindfold comb). I did have a complaint with the customer service from one member of the cabin crew and requested a comment form which was handled professionally by other members of the crew.
800,Alicante to Dublin on 27/10/2012. Although the flight was a little late leaving Alicante due to slow loading of passengers and hand luggage the actual journey was a pleasant experience. I thought all the staff were friendly and courteous. Arriving into Dublin well after midnight all the staff were still smiling and pleasant as passengers disembarked. I will travel again with EI as long as staff continue to smile and look like they care about passengers.
801,We flew United from Seattle to Chicago so was dreading the long flight to Dublin. Flight attendants were nice and helpful and much to my surprise the food wasn't half bad. Comparatively speaking the seats were comfortable; certainly roomier than those on United. Upon boarding each seat had a pillow in it and there were free movies and TV programs to choose from. Landed in Chicago 45 minutes early.
802,Stockholm - Dublin slight delay but comfortable plane and the usual friendly staff. Please Aer Lingus enforce the carry on bag limits it was a full flight and nearly every passenger was hauling on a wheely suitcase. Those of us who had checked in luggage were asked to remove coats and duty free purchases from the overhead bins so that these suitcases could be accommodated which is both annoying and unfair!
803,Dublin - Boston Return. Both flights on time. Great to clear USA immigration in Dublin. Inflight service outbound efficient but staff not as friendly as normal. Inbound staff excellent nothing too much trouble. Inflight entertainment good but on return had to ask for it to be turned on for the whole aircraft. Staff forgot. Then it had to be rebooted. All told took an hour before the IFE was up and running. All flights on time. Seats standard economy seats but comfortable enough. Great to be domestic flight into the USA. Took 15 mins from getting off the aircraft to kerbside.
804,BRU-SVO-LED PEK-SVO-BRU. Short haul flights with A320. Lots of legroom new planes. Long haul flight with new A330-300 legroom ok but bad seats who got pretty painful after a while good IFE with pretty good selection of movies. General comments : staff is good but not too enthusiastic. Food average. You have to pay for alcoholic drinks on long haul flights (alcohol banned on some flights).
805,Moscow DME to Saint Petersburg. Check in was easy. Friendly smiling cabin staff who could communicate at a basic level in English. They passed out candy before takeoff and a mid-flight snack of tea/coffee apple juice and some sort of wafer dessert - distributed newspapers as well. Seating was comfortable with plenty of room.
806,Seoul-Moscow-Warsaw return. Great fare (just 845USD roundtrip) great food onboard. Some delays on both legs but that didn't bother me much. Good news is that Moscow airport has been renewed Wi-Fi and clean air (smoking allowed only in special cabins). They've banned alcohol on board so no more drunk passengers and fights for seats!
807,Like Eric said I don't understand the bad reviews. I have flown the Maun-JNB flight many times and everything has been great. Never had any delays. The last comments are from 2011 and 2010 and now I think they have a brand new fleet. My flight was nice - not the best aircraft.
808,We flew Maun-Johannesburg. Despite the reviews here I was pleasantly surprised. The plane looked new and the leather seats were comfortable. The 2 cabin crew were ok. The plane left on time and landed on time 2 hrs later.
809,We flew ORD to TXL on July 31 and TXL to ORD on Aug. 18. After years and years of flying with UA and having to transfer in Europe it was a relief to fly non-stop to Berlin. The cabin was clean the staff was very helpful and the food was quite acceptable. The seats were comfortable. We had requested wheelchair assistance at both ends and it was ready and waiting.
810,17/8/2014 Berlin Tegel to Dusseldorf AB6445. Dusseldorf to London Stansted F7 276 (with Etihad) 17 August. Our family have travelled with Air Berlin for years mostly within Europe no problems except now they have an inefficient incompetent partner for the route Dusseldorf/London Stansted called Etihad operated by Darwin airline based in Switzerland. Etihad is never on time and 17 Aug flight from Dusseldorf was first delayed by 2 hrs then another 1 hr + then cancelled. That made 2 flights that day cancelled no reason given at the gate. Air Berlin say they aren't responsible and there was absolutely nobody to help reschedule flights. Etihad Regional NEED to be represented at both airports because there was no staff whatsoever so no customer services to help any of the many passengers.
811,8th Aug 2014 London Stansted to Dusseldorf AB5825 and then 9th Aug Dusseldorf to Cancun AB7416 and return 23rd Aug Cancun to Dusseldorf AB7417 and Dusseldorf to London Stansted AB5826. Really good long haul cross Atlantic flights kind and helpful at staff check-in and for in-flight service. Good meals with drinks brought round in between. Planes seemed new with fresh seating and USB ports on the media screens. The short haul Stansted to Dusseldorf parts were delivered by Etihad Regional and again good in-flight service. The only slight negative was the time to check in on return they opened it 1.5 hours pre flight and completed 45 mins before the flight with only about 30 people in line the slowest check per person I've ever known. However Dusseldorf airport was lovely and smart for the wait time between flights. Avoided US Immigration hassles/poor customer service by flying Germany to Mexico.
812,We flew from Abu Dhabi to Phuket with two little ones. Flight was a bit shaky due to monsoon season nothing that captain could do about it the aircraft was new clean food was fine crew very attentive especially the young male attendant on the way back who was superb. The seats were fine too but when the person in front reclined his seat there was unfortunately not much space to move especially with the little one on your laps. Overall it was very pleasant experience and we will fly with Air Berlin again.
813,Bangkok-Almaty (Business) Almaty-Astana-Novosibirsk. The Business Class was very good and liked the beds. There was plenty of space but would prefer truly flat beds. Friendly check-in in Bangkok and food was better than expected. Allowed to stay in the Business lounge while I waited for the connecting flight to Astana. Business lounge in Bangkok was very ordinary and toilets were in a different area. Almaty-Astana-Novosibirsk. Everything was adequate and better food than I expected. These flights were still full.
814,London-Almaty. The best direct flight between London and Almaty. Service is very good cabin crew are all well presented and professional. My only criticism is that I found the selection of wines quite limited. Everything else was as you would expect from a leading international airline boarding inflight entertainment landing etc. I have been a customer of Air Astana for the last 10yrs and can say that services planes and routes have all improved.
815,Friday night back to Almaty they did brilliantly. Excellent selection of drinks served by staff who knew how to mix them well prepared fresh food friendly and professional cabin staff newish plane comfortable seats  good music selection (I even have to admit I found the crass candid-camera-esk overhead TV amusing too then off the aeroplane and out of the airport and into a taxi in 5 mins max.
816,London-Almaty and this airline seems to get better and better. It was streamlined and helpful from check-in to arrival. The staff were unfailingly polite and helpful and did everything possible to make my journey pleasant. It took me a short while to work the seats but I slept very soundly when I had. There is plenty of space and it was an extremely comfortable way to get to Kazakhstan.
817,DUB-LIN and VRN-DUB - The usual Aer Lingus service. On time clean planes friendly FA's. Quite happy that they are enforcing the carry on luggage rule as planes now get off on time. I don't know why people are complaining about having to pay for food. Most EI flights are 2.5 hours or less. Eat before you leave or else bring your own food and stop complaining. I'm very happy with them and will continue to use them. For the fare you pay (if you book well in advance) I have few complaints about the service.
818,We were stranded in JFK on 31st Oct after our airline (a large American) had cancelled our flight for the second time as a result of the Super storm Sandy. The only flight they could re-schedule us for was on 8th Nov and the only customer service they offered was a card with a telephone number. We approached the Aer Lingus staff in JFK who despite having no obligation to help us said they would see what they could do. In the end they managed to accommodate us on their flights and got my family back to Dublin The Aer Lingus staff on the day showed customer service at its very best.
819,I just returned from a tradeshow in the Ukraine. Aeroflot offered the best fare and connections from Nice (via Moscow) so I took a chance - begrudgingly. Brand-new airbus aircraft smiling cabin crew leather seats and plenty of legroom. The crew came and greeted me to thank me for flying them - a nice touch. The food was good - even in Economy. Shrimp smoked salmon a lovely cod dish - very unexpected.
820,LED-SVO. During this one hour journey the crew managed to serve newspapers drinks (with coffee/tea) plus a nice sandwich. New A320 everything went smoothly. Recommend on this busy route between 2 Russian main cities.
821,LHR-Moscow. On arrival asked if possible to have an exit row seat. Was advised of a ??5 charge which was then waived which was a nice start. Aircraft then boarded one hour late and one hour taxi/waiting to take off which made it 2 hrs delayed. Cabin crew efficient but poor command of English. Good leg room/comfort with food as expected on an Economy ticket although alcohol has to be paid for.
822,Istanbul-Moscow-Tokyo (Narita) Economy. Was not expecting much when I purchased the cheapest one way ticket I could find. Check-in at Istanbul despite having a 20 mins wait was friendly and easy. Flight to Moscow delayed 30 mins but the cabin interior was clean and brand new if a bit spartan (no inflight entertainment). Still the seats were comfy and the flight attendants courteous. Moscow-Tokyo leg was great. The seats were comfortable flight attendants friendly and everything went smoothly. My only real complaint is that the choices on the inflight entertainment on this leg were slim but at least it was there.
823,JNB-MUB return. Tried to check in early in JNB and was told to come back later as the BP staff had not started working in the luggage area and the check in staff member thought our bags might get pilfered (liked his honesty). The flights both ways use the new ATR 2-2 seating which was comfortable and adequate. To MUB there was a sandwich service with drinks followed by a 2nd drinks service. From MUB there was just nuts with a drink service. On arrival we were told to sit till we were instructed to stand and they were very strict even after the door had been opened.
824,Very comfortable leather seat. Quick boarding at TXL. They gave snacks and drinks during the flight from TXL to VCE. Very polite and friendly crew.
825,Atyrau to Almaty - friendly service with right amount of attention 3 meal choices excellent legroom great selection of music. Most comfortable.
826,Business class from Almaty to Bangkok. The comfort and service was of highest standard and compared favourably with airlines with better reputations.
827,Moscow to Almaty. This was a good flight it departed and arrived as schedules and the luggage was offloaded efficiently at Almaty. There was a slight hiccup with the check-in and I did not get the seat that I had pre-requested however I finished with a better seat. Flight service perfectly adequate and I was spoken to in English when they realised I was not a native Russian speaker. I had no problems on what was a comfortable flight.
828,Bangkok to Almaty. Very full flight and a booking error in my row which resulted an upgrade to Business Class. Food and service quite friendly with some preferences being given to those who had paid full business class fares. Seats were comfortable recliners and I was a little surprised with the legroom. Service was good and the English better than I expected. Economy class gives value for money but I think that Business Class does not.
829,Travelled with Aer Lingus Regional (operated by Aer Arann) return from Birmingham to Shannon. Flights early in both directions. flight attendants attentive and friendly. Plane on outward journey was 23 years old! Seats were old and tatty but nonetheless clean and comfortable. Return flight on a modern aircraft which was in immaculate condition. Comfortable leather seats made the journey more endurable and the plane was spotless.
830,Flew Dublin to Rome in A320. Flight was on time staff pleasant and seat pitch reasonable. My only quibble was that in Row15 service arrives last of all.
831,Moscow-Delhi Economy. Cabin almost full helpful and smiling stewardesses despite demanding passengers regarding their choice of meals. Missed a glass of wine but no alcohol on this segment.
832,Paris CDG to Beijing Capital via Moscow Shemereteyevo. All flights were on time with good service on board. Inflight entertainment includes several films in French and meals were good. We flew A319 320 and 330 all in good condition.
833,Hong-Kong-Moscow and Moscow-Shanghai. I have to say out of all international airlines I've flown Aeroflot is the most out of date with their entertainment technology. The seats while old were leather and soft and I slept for the first time on a flight. Hong-Kong to Moscow was 1.5 hrs late due to winter storms. Trip to Shanghai was on time and the plane almost empty so every passenger could occupy an entire row. The food was average and the staff do not smile but that's just the culture. I would fly with them again one of the better airlines in the cheaper price bracket.
834,Flew ORD-TXL-STR STR-TXL-ORD. Was nervous after reading all of the comments here but the flight was very good. The IFE was perfect small TVs on the back of every seat in economy with more than enough movies TV shows music and games. Food was decent enough for the price water was served periodically. 5 bathrooms: more than enough. Staff was pleasant enough. Only problem is that the 2 hour layover in Berlin Tegel was hell. Berlin-Tegel Airport is designed terribly and was under construction when I flew but that isn't Air Berlin's fault.
835,Flew business class from Berlin to Abu Dhabi. Outbound flight in the evening was good. Service was great. Flat beds great. Food was pretty poor though. I've tasted better 99p microwave made meals. Inbound flight - flat beds great. Service was awful. I echo comments made here about attendants wanting to get the job over and done with as quickly as possible. On top of that the breakfast was without a doubt the worst breakfast I have ever tasted. A McDonalds McMuffin is fine dining in comparison. So good hard product. Mediocre soft product.
836,We flew Economy with Air Berlin as it was the only carrier that offered a flight from Naples to Stockholm at a good price and we were pleasantly surprised with the whole experience after reading quite a few negative comments in this forum. There was a 3 hour stopover at Berlin Tegel which wasn't great but no issues whatsoever with Air Berlin. Both flights left on time aircraft was newish and clean service was pleasant despite a fully loaded plane and they also threw in coffee and a sandwich. No inflight entertainment but hey on a 2 hour flight who needs it? We were very happy with what was delivered for the price (Italy to Sweden for just $200) and I wouldn't hesitate to use them again.
837,"I recently flew Gimpo - Jeju and Jeju - Busan and what a great experience! Fares were cheap included baggage and when I changed my flights to spend more time in Jeju I only had to pay the fare difference. The seats were the same pitch as Qantas (31"") flights departed close to schedule and drinks were served despite the short flight time. The only slight criticism I have is that their website is a bit tricky parts of it rely on Flash which may be why I couldn't get an English version to load on my mobile device also whenever I tried to put my passport details in I got an error - if this happens try selecting ""No passport"" this worked for me. I'll definitely choose them again if I'm flying their routes - great effort!"
838,PUS-GMP 737-500. The weather was deteriorating and we were caught off guard by a typhoon heading our way. We got rebooked for free quick and friendly service. At the gate the flights would all be cancelled. The flight was bulk loaded pilots ready. The first delay occurred as extra service agents were called to the gate and were providing information to the passengers. After an hour delay we observed extra pilots boarding as well we learned the captain after deliberating safety being his major concern decided to fly out. A quick boarding nearly full flight and we took off in heavy winds and weather while dark. Despite the weather the pilot remarked thanking us for coming along for the ride saying Hang tight and nice flight which broke the tension. Even though it was a bumpy flight the crew were really calm and nice which calmed us all they spoke English too. It's times like this they must remain calm and they did. Not one time did we feel anything other than our safety was what was most important. A very capable and friendly airline.
839,GUW-ALA in Y and ALA-URA in C; both flights on older and somewhat stuffy 757s which however have generous legroom in economy and plenty of space in business. Seats in business are rather tired but still comfortable and service is very good; Air Astana FA's are always professional and friendly. Good food both in economy and business. Flights operated on time. Overall this again was a good experience and I would recommend using KC rather than other domestic carriers (which are to be honest very few in Kazakhstan).
840,URA-PEK via ALA return in Y. Checked-in online but offered a better seat at the airport which is nice of check-in agents. Domestic legs on newish A319 with plenty of legroom in economy. ALA-PEK on rather tired B767 with ancient bulky ceiling TV-sets and stale interiors but the flight and service very good. Had seats 29A+B for myself (exit row seats) on both flights with huge legroom. Special meal delivered as requested. ALA-PEK-ALA are the night flights so service was unobtrusive if you like which is good for couple of hours sleep. Excellent experience with Air Astana (although no competition whatsoever in the local market therefore fares are quite expensive.
841,I never had much of an issue with this airline. Ppolite staff food very reasonable a good selection of drinks and in-flight entertainment. On occasion the flights can be late but this is more due to the weather and the odd mechanical hiccup however this has improved. You may find this airline very expensive (Amsterdam to Atyrau) with 50% saving to be had via other routings. These comments relate to trips Amsterdam to Atyrau Atyrau to Aktau and Istanbul to Atyrau over the last 3 years.
842,I flew to Bangkok from Almaty December 2009. We had trouble at the beginning. Although we checked in on the website they couldn't provide the same seats so we had to sit separately from my wife. They also sold 1 ticket for 2 people but they just couldn't do anything with the situation. The only way would've been to seat one of these guys to the business class. We waited 2 hours on the plane (of course some people missed their connection in Bangkok in the result of this unprofessionalism) until they saw no other solution but that. Very unprofessional attitude. Later on cabin crew were helpful and friendly food was OK good classical music channel to listen airplane relatively new clean very small legroom though for a tall guy.
843,DUB-CDG Return. A very pleasant trip good service from cabin crew. Slight delay returning due to circumstances outside Aer Lingus control. Catering is paid for but not too expensive. Competitive fares make this route worth considering on Aer Lingus.
844,AMS-DUB October 9th and back again October 12th. Both times just after 1PM. No delay on first flight half-hour delay on second but reduced to 20 minutes on arrival. Hand luggage was slightly (about 1 inch) too broad but was never measured or weighed and therefore it wasn't a problem. Both flights about three quarters filled - all single travelers myself included got either a window or aisle seat with the middle seat left clear. Friendly staff and clean planes. On short haul flights no television screens with flight information. Available food on plane very limited. Inflight magazine one of the most boring I've read so far. Good value for money I'd use them again but not for a flight with a layover since (small) delays seem to be common.
845,Aeroflot are not a bad airline though I do feel that for the most part it's fleet and it's service offerings are several years behind those of the competition. I flew Barcelona - Moscow and was swayed by the price. The first leg was in a fairly new airbus A319 with comfortable seats and a clean interior. The only thing of note was the general demeanour of the crew who did nothing to make me feel welcome and were almost hostile in their dealing with the passengers. The pre-flight safety demonstration was multi-language and clear and I found most of the crew spoke English with no problem. In flight refreshments offered were a variety of fruit juices only. Alcoholic drinks are not available though after almost pleading I did get a diet coke. The meal was among the worst I have tasted in my many years of flying. The second leg Moscow-Shanghai was a real eye opener. The Aeroflot website shows that this flight is operated using one of its newer A330 aircraft with in seat entertainment but checking the entertainment listings I found that they been updated for 4 months. Not important of course but an indication of the haphazard approach to service. When I actually boarded I found that the flight is actually operated by (and has always been) by one of the airlines older Boeing 767 aircraft. Aeroflot Boeing 767's are much older than the rest of their fleet and come with little in the way of comfort or amenities. None of our seats or others around us would recline more than 2 or 3 cms. Walking up and down it was clear that no seats offered any noticeable ability to recline. They also had no adjustable headrests. All in all it was a very uncomfortable 11 hour flight. Added to the discomfort was the fact that there was no personal entertainment offered. The aircraft used the old system of large screens placed above the seats around every 10 rows. There were movies played - in Russian often with English subtitles however the quality of the screens and the placement made it an unpleasant experience. Once again the refreshments and food were very disappointing. The omelette breakfast was the only edible thing I had all other food was very poor. The staff on this second flight were more attentive than those previously. My return journey was merely a reverse of the outbound - equally as uncomfortable and equally poor food. The only significant difference was that I had coffee poured over me by one of the cabin crew who gave me a towel to dry my now soaking trousers but still failed to apologize or help in any other way and finally they lost my luggage and once located failed to get it to me for almost a week.
846,I flew Moscow SVO to Helsinki with Aeroflot I'm very happy with the service very helpful staff. Spacious Economy Class and a very good value for more than an hour flight. No delays on time.
847,Moscow-Volgograd round trip on new and clean 737 & Airbus 330 planes. Check-in and inflight service was excellent in spite of our very limited Russian skills. Good inflight meals at no charge. We had switched our overseas flight from Aeroflot to Delta because of poor Aeroflot reviews (should not have done that). The return Moscow-JFK Delta flight was 3 hrs late causing many on the plane to miss connections at JFK while two Aeroflot planes left on time and made their connections. SVO terminal was beautifully clean modern and bilingual with efficient service in stark contrast to the poor arrival image given by JFK.
848,Omsk-Moscow-St Petersburg. Small problems with check-in at Omsk and only received one boarding pass. Breakfast was good and the service leisurely for a 3 hrs plus flight. Plane was full and the flight left and landed on time. Was surprised that they had an English language paper on board. This is an improvement on previous internal flights. Moscow-St Petersburg is a short 80 min flight and received a quick and light second breakfast which was just adequate for this flight. Again the flight left and landed on time.
849,SVO-BKK in Business Class and was quite surprised. Flight attendants are 40+ ladies but cool and friendly food was very good even though it was a low calorie pre-order meal. The plane was without individual IFE but we received portable movie players with a decent selection. Overall on-board experience was great while airport experience was so-so. Business lounge at Sheremetyevo airport was awful with plastic forks almost no food available no A/C. Aeroflot Business Class is a very good value for money.
850,6/08/14 AB7421 ORD-TXL. 6/24/14 AB 7420 TXL-ORD. I had the privilege of flying Air Berlin business class last week from Berlin to ORD. It was my first time with Air Berlin. The seating was the best I have had. The staff were friendly and efficient. On my return from Berlin-ORD I had the best airline meal I have had. It began with a Thai beef salad and I selected Beef Slices in water chestnut sauce for an entree. Both salad and entree had very tender beef. The cold meal was also very good. A recent review said the new business seats were narrow. At 300+ pounds I found it to be fine. I'll definitely fly them again.
851,Dusseldorf to Madrid. Air Berlin is a very nice airline. They gave everyone a complementary sandwich and a drink. Entertainment was okay just a little hard if you are a bit far from the dropdown screen. Staff very helpful.
852,PUS-CJU B737 Short flight from us an to Jeju Island. Left and arrived on time. comfortable seating. No food served; just a 50cc bottle of water handed out. No inflight entertainment.
853,I flew with my family from Fukuoka to Busan for a holiday. Although we stayed for a night in Busan and then flew to Seoul the next day the airport staff were very helpful and friendly they helped me reserve seats for the second route with leg room. The ticket fee was still attractive even though it was during their New Year. No choice for the drink (only Jeju orange juice) inflight. No delays.
854,I recently flew Air Astana from Almaty to Dubai and return and I must say I was impressed with the level of service. We were late out of Almaty but that was not a real problem as the service on the plane was professional. The seat pitch is okay for the 4 hour or so flight to Dubai as is the food. Entertainment was via overhead video units but it was fine to view. No problems with disembarking in Dubai. Equally the return flight was good leaving Dubai at 2300 - good food and service on board.
855,"GUW-AMS B767-300 Business class. I have to say the service has greatly improved. The seating is classic but very spacious. The plane is aging but clean. The onboard service is fair to good and IFE surprisingly diverse. I checked no for ""value"" for money because this ticket costs double the price of a twice as long flight on CX or AF."
856,DUB-BOS return JFK-DUB. Service was very good steward was friendly and attentive food on the flight from Dublin to Boston two levels higher to rate than on the flight home (over seasoned crab cakes and greasy) I immediately got a different menu offered.
857,Connecting flight from DUS to DUB and DUB to DUS no business class available even when booked for the whole flight to BOS that means no lounge in DUS. Female Personnel on board from DUB- DUS (not at the terminal) was disinterested to rude the word please was unknown. The staff were busy on both flights immediately after take off to prepare coffee and sandwiches for their needs and only one had to perform the sales!
858,BOS-DUB-BCN return. A333's between BOS and DUB were clean comfortable and had great entertainment systems. The inflight meal was pretty good for airline food and the service was very good. A320's between DUB and BCN were clean and a little less leg room. They charged for everything including water. When boarding in BCN they weighed our carry on luggage (never had carry ons weighed on any airline ever before including the flight to BCN) one was a bit over so we had to check it at an extra 50 euro.
859,FRA-SVO-OVB. New and spotless A320 plane. Comfortable seats and decent food on both legs. Colleagues had warned me about SVO but found Terminal D in SVO to be first class: very efficient good signage good services. Both planes late by 30 mins but that's about the only negative thing I can say. All in all a good value for money.
860,SVO-HKG (return) in April 2011. I decided to take this trip because Aeroflot recently replaced old fleet on this route with new Airbus A330 and because ticket was quite cheap. The plane is really good food and service are good too. On both legs boarding was efficient and flights arrived on time. The drawback is departing from old terminal F while most Aeroflot flights depart from new terminal D. Check-in and security are much easier in D.
861,I use Aeroflot pretty often on my flights from Los Angeles to Moscow and domestic flights to Russian Far East. Food is great new A330-200 entertainment systems are very good with a big choice of movies. I am loyal to SkyTeam and was forced to used Delta a few times on my journeys to Russian. I realize that Aeroflot staff do not smile always but other things compensate for it. I'd rather not be hungry and bored with okay staff then be hungry and bored onboard of Delta planes.
862,TXL-JFK and return. Can't understand what all the bad reviews are about. Both flights were on time using an A330 with the cabin in a clean good condition. Not a lot of space in economy but I wouldn't say it was much worse than other European carriers. IFE is excellent with a very good selection of Movies and TV series. Food was OK but nothing to write about. Considering the low price and punctuality would definitely use them again. Only negative is Tegel airport which is simply not designed (or capable) of handling large aircraft - but that is not Air Berlin's fault.
863,I flew the OSL-TXL route on an A320. The plane was packed but the staff still did a great job. They gave a coloring book and stickers to my children. They enjoyed the flight. Water was served. The inflight magazine was in both German and English and had some good content. There was some turbulence coming into Berlin but the pilot handled it well and landed.
864,FUK-PUS return on an aged 737-400 clean and offering reasonable leg space. Check-in courteous despite I arrived pretty late. No inflight service for such a short flight they served orange juice but it was not necessary to do so if fares go lower. They have an interesting selection of duty free shopping on the plane it's worth trying it. Uneventful trips and luggage arrived safe and sound. I'd wish they offered more routes into Korea from Fukuoka. Very user-friendly website that allows to catch good fares and per it's seat selection. Flying BX was a nice surprise.
865,PUS-GMP. User-friendly website made the ticket purchasing easy. Departure delayed 20 minutes but the plane arrived on time in GMP. Orange juice and water served on a very short flight. FAs were friendly and efficient. Seat pitch and leg room may be a bit tight but I believe it's common for an LCC. Overall a great choice for those who want to take a domestic flight in South Korea.
866,Busan to Jeju. Flight attendants great and tried to have a little fun with the passengers. On the way they served drinks (water/juice/coffee) and a fortune cookie. They also had some kind of draw for a few different gift certificates. Airplane very new and in excellent condition. Seats were quite close together so my legs were almost pressed against the seat in front of me even though it wasn't reclined (if you're tall it might be irritatingly tight). Overall though a pretty good airline and I will fly with them again.
867,Very good considering the fares. I even wonder when they serve drinks on a 50 minutes flight (Seoul - Pusan). I'd rather have a cheaper ticket.
868,Have flown several times on Almaty - Bangkok route. Whilst not at the level of top airlines I had no problems at all. Flights on time. Food OK. Planes relatively new and clean. Happy to continue as is quickest route for me and no complaints.
869,GUW-IST-GUW A320. Check in smooth and the flight was on time. The plane was a new A320. IFE was limited but this was a 3.5 hour flight. The onboard service was adequate for a medium haul economy class flight. No complaints except for the incredible rise of prices on Air Astana International flights. From Kazakhstan we do not have much choice of airlines and Air Astana is still the only one with a descent safety record so I prefer to use it despite the ever increasing prices.
870,Air Astana is right up there with other non-mainstream airlines who do more to please than most. Great service great food an interior decor and outside livery that have a quality design. Air Astana customers include many oil industry personnel who have flown often worldwide and positive comments are often noticeable among passengers. Agree with a previous comment about FAs who are very pleasant. Service to Atyrau has improved leaps and bounds from the days when a worker cigarette in mouth and large hosepipe in hand used to bang the hull of the plane to talk to the pilot about refuelling. The airport is still a bus station though.
871,Almaty - Atyrau - Amsterdam in Business. Seats are comfortable although not lay flat and space is more than enough. Their duvets are perfect. Cabin crew very friendly and helpful. Food is good service is second to none. Aircraft was clean and flights operated on time. On the ground staff are very helpful. However the Business class lounge is severely lacking in facilities in Almaty. Not even free drinks. In Atyrau there are no Business class facilities at all! Terminal facilities generally in Atyrau are severely lacking. Its not possible to get any refreshments in any way shape or form once you are in the departure lounge. Thankfully if you are just transiting through Atyrau to Almaty or vice versa you're not in there long. All in all very pleased with service its just a shame that terminal facilities let down the rest of the service. Sort that out and its 10/10! Keep up the good work.
872,Flight from DUB-LHR to catch a connecting flight on another airline. Aircraft was clean and comfortable FAs polite and helpful. Flight on time. Only drawback was deplaning at LHR - passengers who were not connecting to another flight exited the aircraft first from the main door onto a jet bridge. Passengers with connecting flights exited last through the rear door down stairs and met a waiting bus. It seemed backwards to make passengers who might have tight connections wait until last to exit. Also since passengers were trying to exit from both the front and rear of the aircraft single-aisle aircraft it was difficult and time consuming for everyone to leave their seat collect their carry on and make their way to the exits. Perhaps this is a restriction coming from the airport rather than Aer Lingus but it seems like something that could be improved.
873,Third time on a transatlantic flight with Aer Lingus. This time we travelled from Dublin to New York and back from Chicago to Dublin. Both flights on time. Clean and new aircraft good food excellent service and great films onboard!
874,DUB - LPA Return. All flights on time. Flights comfortable. Cabin crew very friendly and efficient. Aer Lingus is my airline of choice out of Ireland. Shame no IFE on flights to Canaries as flights are 4 hours in duration.
875,Moscow SVO-Astrakhan ASF-Moscow SVO outward by Aeroflot inward by Nordavia. Access to SVO is tiresome but airport is first class : easy clean and helpful. Both flights on time. Aeroflot a new Airbus Nordavia an old 737. Pilot information good cabin service impeccable light food dull but adequate.
876,Geneva to HK via Moscow. Aeroflot was good for the given price. The customer service was up to the mark (eg. I didnt confirm veg meal while booking but attendant once informed remembered to bring me veg meal with a smile). I found it to be a cultural thing with the russians which you should be open enough to accept it. Things can be little chaotic at Moscow airport. Check which airplanes they are flying on given routes and make booking accordingly - Airbus they had were new.
877,Smooth sailing on all four legs: JFK to Berlin Berlin to Gdansk Warsaw to Berlin and Berlin back to NY. Flights were punctual staff was very friendly and attentive food was decent price was right. Legroom a bit tighter than our recent flights on American and British Air. But overall totally fine.
878,Very good friendly and uncomplicated service. Like the fixed prizing. Makes you wonder why it has to be so stressful travelling in Europe with the likes of Ryanair etc. Would always choose Air Busan again.
879,Air Busan was what I would expect from a LCC. Seat pitch a little tight but enough for me. Flight attendants a little abrasive but you can't judge an airline by one flight attendant! Overall good airline and it serves its purpose well; affordable no frills flying so that is what you should expect. South Korea is small so flights with Air Busan are only in the 1 hour range!
880,GMP-PUS-GMP. Very good fast efficient and friendly staff. At GMP ground handling done by Asiana so all the traditional quirks of this great airlines. Served water and OJ on this very short flight.
881,The have good cabin crew quality of food is good. Their fleet is new enough and I know from some sources that they do their best to provide safety and best service. Sometimes it seems that the prices are too high but if you order tickets via internet you will get a discount especially on trips with some promotions. But this service is worth to be paid.
882,Moscow-Astana-Almaty return. First sectors a 3.5h night flight and wasn't really crowded. I had a row for myself so laid down and had a sleep. Unfortunately after 1h they switched on the lights and served some food. I tried to continue my sleep. As we were delayed and as I didn't have an absolute proper Visa it took me a while for immigration. Searching my bag was easy even I was late and the belts already stopped. Air Astana had some helpful staff there and got my Bag from the luggage room in a minute. Finally I didn't catch my connecting flight. But the rebooking to the next Astana-Almaty flight worked without problems on this Airport. On this flight they served breakfast that was OK. ALA Airport is hell. Staff (even Air Astana check- in) is nearly not speaking English and to get to the domestic check-in you have to have a print out of your ticket as they don't know what an e-ticket is. Staff in-flight was always kind and helpful and had a good English.
883,Went to DUB via ORD. Great experience! Helpful Customer Service. We arrived 1.5 hours early to DUB and on- time back to ORD. First Rate Movies and decent food.
884,Dublin-Malaga Malaga-Dublin. Onboard A330 which was fantastic! Onboard one of Aer Lingus' largest aircraft for a 2 hour flight! Took off on time clean cabin flight attendants and inflight entertainment was fantastic! Would recommend them.
885,Flew MAN-DUB-BOS-DUB-MAN. Cannot speak too highly of transatlantic sectors. Good time keeping clean cabin for today's airlines reasonable food. IFE was adequate for flight duration. Seat was comfortable enough again for the trip duration. What made Aer Lingus stand out on both transatlantic sectors was the service and efficiency of the cabin crew. My only gripe is the connection in Dublin where all of a sudden from being in a business class environment one has to jostle with other passengers. Perhaps they could look at having a dedicated point such as Swiss do in ZRH. Also the security point staff seemed overwhelmed with the scanner operator having to open bags too. I hasten to suggest that over worked staff can lead to lapses!
886,Amsterdam-Moscow-Beijing and back. Friendly staff good meals and good seats. Only in the flights from Amsterdam to Moscow and back is no inflight entertainment. IFE Moscow - Beijing good and a lot of choices of music movies. We had friendly staff even smiles sometime. Meals good different and good quality. A few little delays but nothing more then a few minutes. One problem is that we fly on the old terminal F the people are rude and unhelpful but the new terminals are better.
887,Brussels-Moscow-Beijing and back. Arrived in Moscow 15 minutes late but departure to Beijing was one hour late. Reason (de-icing of the aircraft) was announced. A320 on the Brussels- Moscow stretch older B767 on the Moscow-Beijing stretch. Service onboard was correct and friendly and meals of decent quality. I feel that good quality was offered given the very low fare.
888,BKK-SVO-CDG. Long lines slow and chaotic check-in at BKK. Planes spotless and economy seats reasonably comfortable. Crew did not stop passengers from standing up and opening the overhead compartment while taxiing. Onboard service was minimal. BKK-SVO crew performed their duty but without smiles. SU does not serve alcohol on economy class for the BKK-SVO route. Onboard food has nothing special to mention about. Limited drinks and entertainment choices. SVO transit security checks extremely slow since there was only one counter. SVO has been renovated since I last passed through this airport. I did not expect much and the ticket was the cheapest!
889,KBP-SVO and consider it the best option between Kiev and Moscow. I was promised 500 miles for online check in which didn't work. Airport check in a breeze. Boarding was chaotic A321 spotless with good seat pitch. Fast baggage delivery. Onboard experience was somewhat spoilt with inedible breakfast snack and young crew members who looked lost and helpless. English announcements were hard to comprehend.
890,Air Berlin was fine going from ORD to TXL. Good service actually decent food. Booked an extra size seat. Beware of this. The seats that are by the window in the bulkhead do not have much space for your feet as there is a large boxed in area for the door when it is closed. Aisle seat is fine but window seat not. TXL has to be one of the worst airports I have ever been to. Slow bus service from the plane to the terminal. 2 passport agents for 100's of citizens. On the way back I could not find out where my flight was leaving from as I had made a connection and no one would help me. Poor signs. I had to exit the terminal walk two other terminal down on the street and then re-check in for my international flight. I had 55 minutes between flights and kept asking when I booked was this enough time. I was told YES - plenty. I barely made it and was the last person on the plane. Ran the whole way to the gate. Flight back was not so good. A bit of a surly flight attendant. The guy in front of me kept putting his seat totally back and I could not eat my dinner or even get out of my seat! I am a small person - this was crazy. I asked him for some assistance but even though he spoke English - he ignored me. Would I fly them again probably not.
891,Flew FRA-TXL-SZG. Excellent Airline. Food was good. Helps so much to have a few screens to look at during a flight. The staff were so kind. The funny thing I noticed was they advertise more for Etihad than they do for themselves. Would definitely fly them again.
892,Just returned home from Lanzarote to Belfast on Saturday 25th August and was shocked about the level of customer care given. The senior cabin crew member on the flight was only interested in selling and was continually annoying passengers on the PA and being in the cabin selling things. Whilst I appreciate the airline and crew make money from revenue I have never seen such a cheap and nasty service offered and something I've never seen or expected of Aer Lingus. It was the most uncomfortable flight I've been on as the lights were on bright the entire flight home. Other passengers were complaining but the crew were more interested in selling than making it comfortable for passengers. On a positive note the crew out on Saturday 18th were very good and the crew coming home could learn a thing or two from them! Everything else about the trip was smooth but the journey home just completely spoilt it hence the low scores.
893,Our flight was great and the service wonderful. Staff polite and welcoming and the food good. We had first run movies TV shows games. We flew from New York to Ireland to Italy and back. Would recommend this airline 100%.
894,I've flown Aer Lingus twice a round trip from Helsinki to Dublin and another round trip from Dublin to Bologna. All flights were on time A320 nice and clean with leather seats that have head rests. Flight attendants have always been friendly providing excellent service. Check-in at the airport and getting an assigned seat is particularly nice and makes standing in line for boarding unnecessary. Great value for money and I fly with them on every opportunity.
895,Istanbul to Sharm El Sheikh and Cairo to Istanbul: The planes were new clean Airbus 320. They didn't serve us a hot meal only refreshments (butter cookies and a drink). Even the flights have been delayed for 2 hours on both ways I recommend Air Cairo.
896,This airline made a lot of improvements : new aircraft good crew hot meals - no problem at all during flight.
897,Brussels to Luxor. Good charter airline. Modern A320 aircraft with friendly fa's. No entertainment onboard but hot meal served.
898,BKK to Madrid via Moscow. Except for a bottleneck at Moscow airport the return flights were okay - good food limited inflight entertainment reasonably pleasant cabin staff. I would fly with them again if they continue to offer their low prices. The bottleneck at Moscow - transit passengers had to go through one security machine - completely inadequate for the number of passengers.
899,Kiev-Moscow-JFK. Experienced more of the same disorganization that I saw on my previous flights. I have found that flight attendants to not enforce the rules because they are half the size of their very pushy customers. Flight smooth except for passengers attempting to remove heavy bags and dragging every other object out of the overhead with it. Upon landing in JFK we were delayed getting to our gate. While we were stopped passengers got up and got their bags and raced for the exit. There was no effort made to stop them because of the size difference with the FA's. Plane was new and seats were reasonably comfortable. I feel sorry for Aeroflot staff having to deal with stubborn and highly combative passengers. Aeroflot tickets are cheap enough to entice me to fly with them again even if the passengers act like a mob.
900,Abu Dhabi to Phuket on an Etihad ticket. Air Berlin flies this sector on behalf of Etihad. A satisfying experience. The plane was only around 60% full so I had 2 seats to myself. The seats were a bit cramped so it would be uncomfortable if the flight was full. Very nice and friendly crew who chatted and socialized with the passengers. Food was not bad at all I was actually dreading German food due to my previous experiences with Lufthansa but Air Berlin's food was obviously from Abu Dhabi airport and tasted good. Smooth flight no complaints at all.
901,Moscow to Seoul with Aeroflot. I had trouble at Moscow Sheremetyevo airport at check-in on 27th January my seat booking could not be found even though I had rung the day before and was assured I had a confirmed seat. I was sent to Domestic terminal D to a Korean Air office that did not exist - I rang the airline and again was told my seat was booked and confirmed and after going to the service desk at Terminal D being yelled at by a charming girl I did receive help and a man from Aeroflot escorted me back to Terminal F. I had 4 attendants then check me in and one was waiting at the gate to see that I was OK and to tell me to checkin again at Seoul for my flight to Sydney. The flight was fine food was good and the service was fine. Russian airports are very difficult at the best of times I only speak a little Russian but I have travelled with Russians and it is also difficult when there are problems for them as customer service is terrible one. Russia is not a country where it is easy to travel - at airports there is often no trolleys no one who speaks English and rude service.
902,JFK-Moscow-Kiev. Food and drink were free unlike many American carriers and found the food to be quite good. I did experience a horrible lack of organization and enforcement of the rules. No one would take their seat and flight attendants would not intervene to get things moving faster. Thus my flight from JFK was 20 minutes late taking off. Other than that the service was professional. Dinner was served quickly along with several rounds of drinks none of which were alcoholic. During landing I experienced the same disorganization and lack of enforcement of rules. When were on final approach to Moscow a woman entered the bathroom and would not leave. There was some attempt at removing her but not nearly enough. The flight to Kiev was more of the same passengers refused to take their seats until the plane was actually moving. There as little to no attempt by the crew to seat them. Our flight was delayed over a half hour because of this. Inflight service was good perhaps better than the flight between JFK to Moscow. Despite the short flight a meal was served and drinks came frequently. Overall my complaint was the lack of effort to get the passengers seated. The flight attendants knew enough English to make ordering food and drinks easy despite me not knowing a word of Russian.
903,TXL-MXP return. Pleasant and straightforward flight on time. Clearly not the most exciting option as it is a low budget carrier but excellent value for money.
904,Flew Cologne-Berlin/TXL return. Modern aircraft both flights with Boeing 737-700 one brand new with Dreamliner interior very nice. Good service from flight crew got 2 drinks and offered sweet or salty snack. Crew was nice and smiling. Pilot informed during flight and arrived on time in Berlin. Baggage was quick on belt. TXL is an old airport and that is not to blame Air Berlin for that. Return flight was nice as well crew gave me a 3rd hot drink that was a nice touch. Plane was not full and the service was nice and with a smile. Much better than Germanwings. I wish Air Berlin would fly CGN-HAM.
905,Milan-Berlin-Antalya and return via Dusseldorf: a reasonably enjoyable experience although Berlin Tegel was possibly the worst 'airport experience' I can remember for a long time especially as I had a 4 hour layover stuck in what seemed like a make-shift demountable building plus use of a few old steel chairs. Nevertheless it was good that Air Berlin efficiently recognised my One World Emerald/Platinum Status so I had pre-allocated good seats and quick check-in with early 'pre-board' on every sector. I also pre-ordered their hot meals and bought myself some wine on-board so not a bad experience overall. The return flight back from Antalya was somewhat bizarre but enjoyable with only 10 out of 210 seats occupied so it was essentially an empty aircraft - all other flights were full (and all on-time). Priority luggage does not appear to be recognised. All in all quite a pretty good experience and which reminded me for the benefit of my fellow countrymen very much like some of the better Jetstar flights and experiences in Australia.
906,BRS-DUB-BOS. We flew from Bristol to Boston connecting in Dublin. The regional flight was on time with quite poor legroom but we arrived early in Dublin. We changed terminal on one of the buses. The 11am flight from Dublin to Boston doesn't clear immigration in Dublin but it was no big deal. Non-alcoholic drinks were complimentary but things you had to pay for were obviously overpriced. The crew were pleasant and the entertainment was fine. Overall the flights were very good.
907,Travelled to USA - economy class outbound and business class inbound. Service was superb both ways. Staff friendly on both transatlantic flights and on Glasgow - Dublin / Dublin - Glasgow flights. I would have no hesitation in travelling with Aer Lingus again.
908,We had a terrible experience with how our cancelled flight was handled and the subsequent customer service after the flight on June 22nd out of New York (JFK) to Shannon. After returned to JFK due to problems with the plane's mechanics we were on the tarmac for 3.5 hours and then it took another 3 hours before we arrived at a hotel to spend the night. The next day we returned to the airport and there were only 2 ticket agents to re-ticket almost 400 passengers. We were given vouchers to use on the plane which we could not use once we got on the plane! We missed our reservation in Shannon and Aer Lingus would not refund this amount. The customer service at the New York Office was just an ineffective as the services we received in the airport.
909,It seems the common thread with most fliers on Aeroflot is that planes and flight service is good but the Airport in Moscow is no where near international standards. I agree! I flew one way from Yerevan Armenia to Moscow and on to Los Angeles. New Airbus planes good leg room and above average meals. The flight crew seemed like they would rather be elsewhere and were not very interested to assist when someone had taken my seat. I had to stand for a while and then took matters into my own hands and found another seat.
910,"Oslo - Moscow - St Petersburg return. Fine crew meals and planes. Boarding in A319 in Oslo took some 40 minutes most of which were spent inside the aircraft waiting for other passengers to take their seats - thanks to lack of management and guidance from the cabin crew. Due to this arrived to Sheremetyevo D with a 35 minutes delay cutting my connection time down to 40 minutes. Passport control /customs very fast. Waited for luggage about 15 minutes. Ran to the transfer desk where two of the three staff said they can offer re-booking for a later flight to LED. However the third representative was extremely helpful did few phone calls to warn the gate that I am coming and basically ran with me through the corridors carrying my luggage to the LED flight gate. Unfortunately the flight to LED was delayed people were standing at the gate for 40 minutes hearing no info but only ""5 more minutes!"". Finally the gate personal announced cancellation of the flight and we were rescheduled for the flight departing in 2 hours. On the way back from St Petersburg everything went smoothly I even did not need to pick up my luggage at Sheremetyevo for customs clearance. Service and flights were just great. Aeroflot does change for the better but has to put more effort into ground staff training and customer service. English training for the crew is necessary as well. As for lack of smiles - I guess this is simply a cultural feature - Russians generally reserve smiles for situations of fun and/or pleasure and apparently Aeroflot staff do not feel much of either at work."
911,Amsterdam to Bangkok via Moscow Sheremetyevo. Amsterdam to Moscow can be compared to a flight with any European airline you get even a warm meal. Moscow to Bangkok was excellent service was good even though the crew did not speak good English. Announcements in English were very difficult to understand. You get a warm meal twice and in between drinks and snacks. The selection of drinks is awfully poor for a long haul flight. Aeroflot does not serve any alcohol on flights to Bangkok but they also have not replaced those alcohol drinks with anything else. You are served only Cola Fanta Sprite water tomato juice apple juice or orange juice tea and coffee. Inflight entertainment was excellent with many films and games as well as music. The only negative thing we could find was the fact that Russian passengers do not take safety matters very seriously. We heard mobile phones ringing and passengers going to use the toilet during approach! Apart from the routine announcements and checking seat belts the crew was not interested in telling passengers to behave.
912,"Oslo-Berlin (Tegel). Boeing 737-700 round trip. Same equipment. Check in was fast both ways. We checked in 1 bag. You can have 1 free (23kg) bag checked in. Pretty much left gate on time both ways. Seats were comfortable but jiggly. I got the seat of the passenger sitting in front of me in my lap during take off both ways. Air Berlin says on their website state they will give you a free non alcoholic drinks and a Ham/Cheese sandwich on flights over 90min. We got a choice of ""sweet or salty"". Note: If you choose ""sweet"" you will get a waffle bar. If you choose ""salty"" you will get a bag of chilli potato chips. Drink choices of coke products and juice/coffee. It would have been nice if they asked if you want a ""waffle bar"" or a ""bag of potato chips"" because I was confused. An overall average flight. Left on time and landed on time. Good value for money."
913,TXL-TFS 5 hours flight was on time friendly flight attendant but the free food was not good at all. There was the choice cheese or chicken sandwich. The food you have pay for was a little bit better but still not worse the money. The flight was not expensive so I would recommend this airline.
914,Flew from DUB-BCN. Never a problem on EI clean plane nice crew reasonable (ish) price for snacks and drinks and T2 in Dublin is a breeze. Why they don't try and sort it out and try to become a 4 star airline is beyond me if Virgin Australia can do it and they can't touch EI on some levels then what's stopping them?
915,Flights LHR-DUB return. Check in at LHR got us an earlier flight aircraft clean and seating very comfortable. Cabin crew on both sectors were very helpful legroom ok for a short haul flight. First experience with Aer Lingus and will use them again. Overall very pleased.
916,BHX-DUB-ORD. Very professional crew frequent updates from the pilots arrived 50 mins ahead of schedule food was very nice for economy class. Cabin crew very attentive and always checking up to make sure everything is okay and offering more free tea and coffee. Cabin was very clean and bright and quite quiet. IFE had a large range. Pre clearance at Dublin airport was fantastic and meant we were out within 25 mins once we reached Chicago.
917,Athens to Moscow Sheremyetevo return. New A320 polite staff good food. Price was cheap. I would fly again with Aeroflot.
918,London-Moscow-Bangkok price way cheaper than competitors when we booked planes seemed pretty new decent choice of films music games etc so-so - food. Staff extremely unfriendly no alcohol in economy 3 hours in Moscow. Would always have to be way cheaper than better alternatives such as Thai Etihad Emirates for me to use them again. However much better than Royal Jordanian who we used to BKK last Christmas - they were truly appalling.
919,Copenhagen - Moscow - Havana. First flight an A319 seats quite comfortable with good legroom and delicious dinner. Moscow-Havana new A330-200 seats good although they don't recline were much. The biggest drawback was that IFE offered a very limited amount of movies and TV shows no where near main competitors.
920,I fly Air Berlin every 2-3 weeks long haul from Europe to Miami doing the same flights all the time. One thing that stands out is that they are not consistent. The crew (under-staffed) do not work as a tight team and so the service is often all over the place. Being a TopBonus Gold member makes no difference at all except for priority check-in lounge access and pre-aboard. I always fly economy and choose to sit at the back I usually miss a choice of meal the seat next to me is rarely kept free and the regular collection of rubbish from your seat is very poor or non-existent. I often disembark with a seat pocket full of rubbish or I take it with me to the toilets during the flight. When pressing the call button they attend to your seat turn the call button off and then a give quick glance to see if you actually wanted anything. Water is given to you in a bottle there is no mid-flight juice/water service. When boarding they have 1-2 crew members greeting passengers while the rest stand in the galley no effort to emerge and help people find seats store luggage etc. I fly Etihad frequently and am shocked at the tie-up the two airlines have - complete opposites when it comes to service. I have a tomato allergy for which I can rarely get a special meal so when boarding I ask them to make sure they put aside a meal that does not contain tomato this request is often met with no response or an attitude of that is a lot of work of 14 in the last year only once did a crew member actually give me a crew meal. I now take my own food. Have tried several times to upgrade to business class with miles but never been able too. On a positive note the long- haul aircraft is modern IFE is excellent and seat comfort is ok and they are nearly always on-time. I have flown business class a few times and they are excellent - there is however only two business class cabin crew for 19-20 people so if full I imagine service would be different when I have flown there is only a 10-12 people in business class.
921,DUS-TXL-MAD. AB cancelled the original DUS-MAD flight which was quite a nuisance. So had to fly via Berlin which added 3 hrs since they didn't offer to fly direct on their OW-partner Iberia. On the positive side: very punctual flawless performance. Free drinks and a nice snack and only 80 euros one way. Seating in 737-800 to TXL cramped. Luckily an empty middle seat. Otherwise it would be hardly bearable.
922,SZG-HAM-SZG on A320 both ways. Long time ago since I last flew with Air Berlin and it was a positive surprise. Both flights on time. Cabin was very clean and spotless seats are nice and not cramped. We even got coffee and tea on this one hour flight. FA's very friendly. Overall a very good experience and I would fly Air Berlin again on European routes.
923,We have today flown back from Cork airport on flight EI3701 to Birmingham. There were four of us so I pre-booked seats on Row 3 to ensure that we sat together. Unfortunately the legroom in these seats was much narrower than the rest of the seats. The two male passengers were 6ft 4in and 6ft 2in so you can imagine the uncomfortable journey they had to endure. It would have been preferable not to book seats in advance and take pot luck!
924,I flew from Shannon to Boston yesterday 7 July and must say that I was both shocked and horrified that three of the female cabin crew including the cabin manager were chewing gum whilst serving food etc. I expect that here by the staff on US carriers but not Aer Lingus. Otherwise the flight was faultless.
925,Most recently SXF-DUB-SXF return. The economy class product its getting better after dipping for a few years. Most of the A320s now seem to have the more comfortable seats with moveable headrests and a little more legroom than before (29 rows now instead of 30 I think). I'm an occasional flyer on this airline maybe half a dozen times a year mostly Spain-Ireland or Germany-Ireland. The staff are still pleasant if less experienced. It's a significant notch above Ryanair in overall product and service and worth a premium (often there is none). Pricing overall is competitive.
926,After a long trip from Sydney-Abu Dhabi and a stop time of 3 hours (+1/2 hour delay) the more than 7 hours flight to Dusseldorf started. After almost 2 hours flying finally the staff offered us a small sandwich (with beef or cheese) and one cup of coffee. Another 2 hours later we got a bottle of water. Doing nothing but trying to sit compressed between my seat and the extreme tilted seat in front of me I really felt hungry. When I asked for another piece of bread I got one and the promise that there would be more served in 20 minutes. Indeed we got food. While collecting the rubbish we were offered a drink coffee? No only cold drinks. Before my experiences with Air Berlin were ok but this last flight was really unpleasant.
927,JFK to DUS. Great flight. 8 hour trip non stop great entertainment and staff service was excellent.
928,DUS-AUH on December 24th 2013. Air Berlin 7460 code-shared by Etihad. The seats don't offer much space but I was very impressed by the personal entertainment system. It basically looked like a tablet - very sharp display touch screen fast response. I've haven't seen such a great system anywhere else yet (I only fly economy though). When somebody's unit stopped working the flight attendant brought a replacement! The only drawback of this was the fact that it was a night time flight so I tried to get some sleep rather than spend the time watching movies.
929,ZRH to TXL and back in mid-November 2013. As an OW Sapphire member I was able to reserve a seat for free in advance additionally because I made the seat reservation only 3 days prior to departure I was able to obtain an XL seat free of charge which is something that Air Berlin normally does not offer its OW partner members. On the flight to TXL the plane type was changed without advance notice so I ended up with a normal seat but on the way back I enjoyed the larger legroom. I must say that if you're taller than 6'2 the normal seats are at the limit of what one could call comfortable. Though there is no pain or pressure in any way. The fare cost less than 5$ the rest made up of various taxes and fees and it ended up costing me around 120$. I like the fact that overall the service was good enough for this amount of low fare. Along with the good public transport connections in ZRH and TXL door-to-door cost me 135$. Departure was on time in both cases. Staff was friendly in both cases though there was nothing special about food and beverages being offered. No inflight entertainment at all bring your own.
930,LHR-DUB flight was very well done by all accounts quiet and well maintained. The staff seemed very courteous and keen to engage in small-talk with customers. DUB-LHR flight not brilliant more down to bad luck than anything else on this flight it was more the people I was with that caused aggravation behind me shaking my seat back and forth as if it was a play-thing. This wasn't helped by the person in front of me reclining back so there little room. I am not questioning the plane attendants or cleanliness.
931,BHX-DUB-JFK outbound BOS-DUB-BHX inbound. Outbound: BHX very quiet no queue for check-in all on time A320 clean the seat is fine for such a short flight. At Dublin the transfer was pretty smooth took approx 30 mins to pre-clear US Customs and Immigration. You don't collect and recheck your bag it's checked through and you are shown a picture of it on the belt to confirm it's yours etc. Boarded A330-300 clean tidy good AVO generally a nice plane to be on. Sat in the 2 row mini-cabin at the front quietest flight I've been on. Recaro seat is fairly decent. Food was perfectly edible and the crew were helpful and friendly. Arrived early into JFK bags came within a few mins. Return flight much the same exact plane and seat. 30 mins late boarding but made up most of it - arrived 5 mins late. Transfer was much easier and quicker A330-A320 in 30 mins left ahead of schedule arrived early to BHX and was quickly out of the airport. Overall very happy and I think this will now be my preferred route to the East Coast saves the trek to LHR.
932,Southend to Dublin. Excellent airport new route from May. Aircraft was nice clean ART42 nice leather seats which had plenty of legroom for the 1 hr 35 minute flight. Excellent inflight with smiling hostess.
933,DUB-AMS ORK-AMS DUB-LGW CDG-SXF. I'm a regular user! Staff are always lovely and will go the extra mile to help you if you need it. Planes are clean and on time. I'm taking a longish haul to LA in August and am going via DUB not only because they have excellent fares but I'd pick them over United Delta BA or Air France any time.
934,"We paid extra for seats with leg room from Chicago to Berlin and on to Salzburg. We did get the leg room seats. However it seems that Air Berlin seats are exceptionally narrow. I did not measure the seat but my guess is that even an inch or two makes a great deal of difference. As we were taxiing in (both directions) the air conditioner condensation came dripping down onto my legs. On the way to Berlin this was a significant amount of water less so on the way back. The flight attendants who were sitting facing us and just smiled and said ""condensation"". While on the plane after I read for a while I attempted to turn off the overhead light. It would not go off. The flight attendant said that it had to be turned off by the computer which for the life of me I could got get into place. After he helped he could not get the computer to turn off the light. He switched computers and that still didn't work. We asked if we could change seats but there were not leg room seats available. The flight attendants tried to be very helpful. Berlin Tegel is a grey stone cold airport. Cigarette butts all over the place. Even people who were cleaning just bumped into you with the mop without a word of ""excuse me"" like the whole row of waiting passengers was supposed to get out of our seats while she mopped. I would not recommend Air Berlin."
935,DME-DUS-VRA and back. Excellent airline which offers very competitive prices but also good service. The flights from Moscow and back were on time. The connections in Dusseldorf went smoothly. The transatlantic flights were great. I enjoyed excellent entertainment system which provided wide selection of great movies and music. The food were very tasty and fresh. The staff were very efficient and polite. All in all a very pleasant experience. I would recommend not to economize though and pay some extra fee for the preferred seat selection since the leg room is rather scarce.
936,Flew from Dublin to Boston return with a group of 65 teenagers. Check-in was straightforward and both flights pleasant and uneventful. Excellent product with good crew and well maintained cabin. No complaints!
937,"JFK-DUB Nice flight on a new clean airbus. Food was excellent and IFE was fine with recent movies and plenty of music and games. The seat was not that comfortable as it was not a ""Lay flat"" but had a slight angle. Still managed a few hours sleep. Crew attentive and pleasant throughout."
938,ORD-DUB-ORD. Great service both during the check-in process and onboard on both flights. Very good IFE and decent food. The fact that you have to pay for alcohol is a bit annoying but it is becoming the standard in the industry. Clearing customs in Dublin is a great plus. Overall a very good experience.
939,"Slow check-in in Beijing. Used the Air China Business Lounge which is consistently disappointing. Flight was ready to leave the gate on time but ATC had grounded all flights due to pending thunderstorms. The captain did a stellar job keeping the passengers informed while we waited on the tarmac for 4 hours. The crew served water, juice and snacks during this time. Once airborne, the service was prompt and FA's generally friendly although a couple of them appeared to be annoyed and uninterested in their job. Dinner and breakfast were OK with reasonable number of meal and drink choices. The pods are at the end of their service life with cushions becoming inadequate for restful sleep. IFE content was mediocre and sound quality was poor. Due to the lengthy delay in Beijing, I missed my connection but the wonderfully polite and helpful agent who took my call at AC's Concierge Desk had me secured on the very last flight out and even had my boarding pass delivered to the arrival gate in Toronto. It is nice to see there are still some service-minded people left at AC. The flight from Toronto to Montreal had very basic service given the short duration and the time of day. Luggage delivery both in Toronto and Montreal was shockingly slow."
940,Vienna to Rome in October 2013. Vienna has this amazing facility where if you fly Air Berlin or Austrian you can check your hold luggage in at the city train station up to a day before and take the express train out to the airport. We made use of this facility and despite being a bit doubtful everything worked perfectly. Thanks to this we had no waiting time at check-in or at the airport. Boarding was orderly and quick even with only one person at the gate. Flight crew was friendly the plane being a newish A320. Inflight snack was okay nothing special but I've seen worse airplane food. On arrival in Rome we had to wait over half an hour for our luggage but that seems to be par for the course there. All in all I'd fly them again.
941,"Travelled from Berlin to Chicago. I generally have low expectations of airlines today especially when travelling with my national flag carrier British Airways. I was pleasantly surprised by this flight. Yes Economy Class seat pitch is just 30"" but the scooped out seat backs help in that respect so you gain a little knee room. The food was pretty good that is to say I've had a great deal worse and the crew were friendly and attentive at all times. I particularly liked the entertainment system which worked well and had large seatback screens. All in all for an Economy Class flight of nearly nine hours not a bad experience."
942,"FRA-TXL-FRA: Just 55min flight but complementary snacks and soft drink in the afternoon flight and also complementary warm bread and soft drink in the early morning flight. Cabin attendants were friendly on both flights. Even landing on time at FRA due to full spots we had to wait on a taxiway for 10min. Outsourcing ground staff at TXL could not answer where the AB lounge was. ""I don't know"" with smile."
943,I have not used Aer Lingus for many years because of cost. I recently went from Dublin to New York. Outward journey perfect. Return another matter. I could not book a seat and at JFK I was the very first in line I was handed a boarding card not having been asked if I would like an aisle seat or otherwise. I did ask for the same seat I had on the outward journey if it was available. I was told it was not and handed the boarding card within 10 seconds. The impression I I got was that the lady at the desk did not even look. It will be a while before I use Aer Lingus again.
944,Recently travelled from Edinburgh to Dublin and the plane was delayed 40 minutes. On our return flight the plane was once again delayed 30 minutes. In March we made the same journey using Ryanair and there were no delays. It is very difficult to contact Aer Lingus as they don't give email contact details.
945,JFK-DUB-NAP. Seasonal route to Naples. Outstanding product service and price. Beats any US airline. Professional pilots and FA pleasant and clean cabin A330-300 decent pitch IFE. Armrest does not raise all the way. DUB-NAP on clean A320 Sky Deli edible enough price competitive with airport. Return DUB-JFK A330 bulk seat 9D in private cabin behind Business. Cool spot IFE screen folds with armrest. DUB T2 is small and efficient transfer.
946,GLA-DUB-GLA. Very reasonable flights but we did not check-in any bags. Check-in with iPad was simple and straightforward and we breezed through security in both directions. ATR-72 plane was ideal for this short flight. The propellers are a lot louder than a jet plane but the 2x2 seat layout is much more suitable for most travellers than the usual 3x3 you expect on sort haul flights. The planes were comfortable and well maintained and the service both ways was professional and friendly. Overall a perfectly acceptable for the short route with an excellent frequency to Glasgow. Much better value for money than the competition (Ryanair from PIK which is invariably more expensive and less frequent). My only real complaint is the need to bus passengers out to a very remote stand in Dublin.
947,Air Berlin domestic TXL-DUS-TXL 737-800. Though almost fully booked on both ways boarding was smoothly (maybe due to new boarding process). Crew - as always at Air Berlin - a bit of a mixed box: varying from friendly with a personal touch to absolutely indifferent. Seat quality and choice of snacks and beverages very good for a short hop. Arrival 5 min late both ways - so almost on time. All in all good domestic product and value for money.
948,"SKG-Dusseldorf-Stansted. Flight went very well. All on time. Polite staff and good ""meal"" on board. I would recommend."
949,LHR-JFK via Dublin. Lounge access at Heathrow and very nice lounge in Dublin - impressive airport. Flight from LHR-DUB was very full and uncomfortable. Flight from DUB was in new and very clean A330 - only 10 passengers in business class. Excellent service and very impressed with the food quality. Seat was comfortable and spacious. All in all a good experience - would not like an overnight flight as the seat was not at all comfortable for sleeping - angled type and impossible to get comfortable in that position - also a bigger pillow than the regular economy version would have been appreciated.
950,Dublin-Barcelona: 29 teenagers and three teachers. Ground staff were not very good they seated the group in different rows but they handled hand luggage in an efficient elegant and professional way. No room inside the cabin? No problem they check it in for you at no extra cost. One appreciates such details when dealing with a bunch of students and all their souvenir purchases. As for the flight - peaceful even though I could have used some more leg space.
951,BHX-DUB-JFK return. Short flight BHX-DUB was fine. Clean plane friendly attendants but cramped leg space which is fine for such a short flight. I had prepaid for my seat selection but due to aircraft change DUB-JFK I was moved to back of plane. I complained to attendant at gate in DUB who apologised and offered to put me in a window exit seat as there were no other aisles available. I preferred the aisle and so stayed with it which turned out to be fine. FA's are for the most part very friendly except for a couple on the return who were efficient but not really friendly. The best thing is being able to go through customs for the US in Dublin on the way out. No lines and easy to get through. ATR on the way back from DUB-BHX looked very old and not very well taken care of. Overall I liked Aer Lingus and plan to fly them again next time I go to the States.
952,DUB-MAD. Airbus A320. Boarded 30 minutes prior to departure and left ahead of schedule. Terminal 2 in Dublin very clean modern and spacious. Cabin crew friendly efficient and professional throughout. Purchased drinks and snacks which were of good quality and sold at reasonable prices. Seats leather and comfortable with acceptable legroom. All in all a good flight. The only negative aspect was Madrid Terminal 1 which is old fashioned and lacked any decent facilities.
953,"Flew out economy but paid extra to get 35A which is an exit row seat. Seat was ok but a bit snug width-wise. Queues for the loos tended to stand right in front of me so it was a busy area. Inflight entertainment was good but would benefit from more recent films. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful and always happy to answer questions. Food was really good, a lot better than other economy flights I have taken. Coming back I upgraded to Business Class and was given seat 7a. I didn't get to choose as I missed my original flight due to a connecting flight cancellation so was just happy to have made the flight. Seat was ok but uncomfortable in fully flat mode - it would have been a lot more comfortable with an extra cushion layer. Flight attendants were friendly but rushed to get everything done before people wanted to sleep. Food was good but some choices ran out quite quickly. I liked the idea of pre-ordering breakfast and letting them know if you wanted to be woken for it or not. Overall a good flight, a lot better than the experience I had on my connecting flights with Jazz"
954,DUS-JFK Business class flight 7450. Good service good staff good food good wine and drinks but the seat was horrible.
955,ZRH-DUB-ZRH. Tale of two airlines. Web check-in on the way out went well. Full load but crew was helpful arranging hand luggage. Dealt well with some difficult passengers. Crew professional some very friendly. Check-in machines on the return worked well. Passengers seated in the back where allowed to take big hand luggage with them. Those in the front were not so felt sorry for those who paid even more than for a standard seat as they either had their bags checked in for pick up or had to store it at the back of the plane. Front two crew members absolutely unmotivated and yelling at passengers. Prices no longer that cheap. Terminal 2 is ok. Flight to Dublin would be a 8. Back would be a 3. Buy onboard choice is good and prices are ok.
956,"GVA-DUB and DUB-MCO. GVA-DUB in economy and DUB-MCO (Orlando) in Business. Both flights on time and impressed by the cabin staff. The Dublin to Orlando flight was lovely - very nice food and wine(s). Seat - not a flat bed and was very comfortable for sitting for sleeping it was not and I cannot imagine spending a night in it. Our bags were tagged through from GVA-MCO and when we checked in for DUB-MCO flight only 2 could be located. Counter staff went out of their way to locate and re-tag the ""missing"" bag. Pre-clearance for the US was speedy and pleasant. All in all we were very impressed - service and price both right!"
957,"Smooth check-in aided by a friendly agent in Montreal. First leg to Toronto left and arrived on time. A small but tasty snack and full bar service was available on the short flight to Toronto and the FA was friendly and very efficient. Flight from Toronto to Beijing had an orderly boarding process and was ready for departure however a last minute delay was encountered to remove luggage belonging to a passenger who did not show up. The aircraft interior looked in dire need of an overhaul with floor boards torn off at the pods, food splattered on the pod walls and side panels of the seat hanging loose. The service from the FA's was warm and conducted efficiently. Food was of reasonable quality and quantity and it was good to see an updated menu. There was a good selection of wines, spirits and soft drinks but there were no hot beverages available during the 13 hour flight due to a maintenance problem. I learned later in the flight that the very same aircraft had been suffering from this for the last three weeks. IFE was disappointing as the content had not been updated for the last four months and did not match what was advertised on their website and magazines. The pod style seats need an upgrade as they are worn out and becoming uncomfortable. The flight arrived late but mainly due to congestion in Beijing. Luggage was delivered promptly. Overall it was an OK experience but lack of coffee and tea on a very long flight (especially to China) was inexcusable."
958,"Initially I was reluctant to fly Air Canada after all the bad press about their service and quality but I can only give a big thumbs up for overall service and friendliness of the crew. Food quality is poor, but no worse than most other airlines."
959,My flight was on 9/1. I took the 2 hour flight from Zurich to Dusseldof and then Dusseldof to JFK. There is no sign outside Zurich airport about Air Berlin you have to discover that its Check In area is at 3. Check-in line was short and easy. The plane arrived at Dusseldof with no gate so a bus took you to the door. Once you exited the door you enter Germany. You have no idea where you were. I found out I had to move from the arrivals area to the departures area. I had to go trough the security check and then get my passport stamped. The inflight service and food were excellent. There were two meals. Flight attendant provided non-stop service and distributed water bottles. The programs on the monitor were excellent and the screen has very good resolution. The flight map was not working.
960,I fly twice a week LHR-DUB. Generally acceptable but quite average. Services mostly on time and the journeys smooth. The Aer Lingus Dublin lounge is very pleasant and the staff helpful. Many cabin staff have an unpleasant attitude that suggests we should be thanking them for giving us the opportunity to fly with them - we expect to be treated with at least a bit of respect! The loyalty scheme is not great - they will not provide points for basic non-flexible flights.
961,DUB-TFS-DUB. Great airline to fly with when travelling with children. Flight attendants seem to make even more of an effort with them. Like the look of their new inflight menu and what we bought onboard was tasty. T2 is a pleasure compared to what DUB was previously.
962,MAD-IAD. Good value for money a step up on the appalling service that we expect from the legacy US carriers but pretty minimal. This is a code share with United and for all intents a United flight in Aer Lingus livery and standard legacy service issues (complimentary and edible meal but you have to pay for alcohol and snack services). A330 was clean and serviceable. Economy had the usual cramped seats. IFE system is good. For the price it is good value.
963,GLA to ORD via DUB return. The flight to Dublin was with Aer Arann which was fine for the 50 minute flight. Flight to Chicago on A330-300 and we sat in a small three row cabin just behind business class which was excellent. Crew were friendly and professional and the meal was standard economy fare. Only one bar run so if you wanted wine with your meal you had to purchase it. The return flight was only 6.5 hours which was great and the catering was very tasty. Overall a very good product by Aer Lingus.
964,JFK-TXL return in Economy. Overall quite satisfied with Air Berlin. Check-in at JFK quick and staff accommodating in helping find me a good aisle seat (I am rather tall). Gate staff and boarding were fine. AVOD fine although TV choices were a bit limited. Seats are comfortable legroom should be more than adequate for someone under six feet. Cabin crew were polite drinks service was punctual liked the whole bottles of water handed out. Food was merely decent. Return flight same comments although TXL gates leave a lot to be desired. Overall I would recommend AB; despite their lower cost they are indeed better than most United States carriers when it comes to Economy long-haul.
965,28th August 2013 from Malaga to Hamburg on a very well maintained 737-800. Journey started with online check-in and a bag drop at Malaga airport. The queue was not orderly and the staff did not police the queue very well at all. The check-in agent who dealt with me seemed indifferent and did not make eye contact with me which was rather rude. Boarding the flight took quite a long time as the flight was full. Far too much hand luggage had been allowed aboard the flight. The cabin crew were not very friendly nor welcoming at all. There was considerable turbulence during this flight and the crew did little to allay the fears and concerns of some of the passengers. A small snack was served as well as a drink. At the end of the flight an overheard monitor displayed the route taken for a few minutes only. There was no goodbye from the crew at the end of the flight. I found the staff very cold on this occasion.
966,"Overall very satisfied with Air Berlin. Returned from a cruise which ended in Venice. First took a short flight to Dusseldorf to then catch the connection to JFK. All connections were made on time. The Air Berlin flight staff were all very congenial. Was able to watch three movies on their entertainment system to pass the time. Food was good. ""Open"" bar even better. I would definitely fly Air Berlin again."
967,We are frequent business class travellers this was our first time with Aer Lingus from LHR to MCO via DUB. The whole experience was excellent. Crew were professional but friendly seats comfortable the food delicious and choice of wines good. Given the price we paid - roughly half that of the other airlines we generally use - the service represents great value for money. A shame they don't offer business class on European services but we were still able to use their lounges at LHR and DUB.
968,Dublin-Budapest return. Very organised and efficient boarding with on-time departure from DUB. Smooth flight and early arrival into BUD. Cabin crew courteous although a little functional. Return flight delayed 40 minutes. Pilot and crew apologetic for delay. Plenty of information given on routing arrival and weather. Cabin crew were friendly and accommodating. Problems with excessive hand-luggage is regular on this flight but this was dealt with at check-in and by onboard crew efficiently.
969,BRU to DUB. As a regular flyer with Aer Lingus (Gold Circle Prestige) it is with regret that despite improvements in some areas (e.g. improved lounge) Aer Lingus has difficulty differentiating itself with its competitor Ryanair and passengers are not always the highest priority. Despite a stated policy allowing a cabin case and a personal item such as a laptop bag Aer Lingus has not communicated this to ground crew which led to a poor experience. It is not acceptable for a passenger to be castigated for exceeding the luggage limit when in fact this is not the case. It is also standard practice with other airlines that bags taken from passengers due to lack of space can be collected at the door of the plane rather than at the baggage belt - this is crucial when transfers are involved. Another recent trend is that the seat belt sign is left on until service is completed - a benefit for crew and cabin service rather than passenger comfort. Aside from these issues the flight crews have been generally pleasant on recent trips and 7 out of my last ten flights have been on time although thankfully I had built in enough time to make transfer flights.
970,Use Aer Lingus for European flights about 5 times a year. We have found that over the last year or two their planes are filthy the seats food-trays and seat-pockets are sticky and dirty every time we travel. We have always used Aer Lingus when possible and have found the service pricing and onboard staff to be excellent but the poor cleanliness is really letting them down. I can't understand why they are letting this area slip so badly.
971,TXL to SOF return. Really can't complain about their short haul product - both flights were on time a drink and a snack offered and crew on both legs were friendly enough. At least the short haul service is comparable to established airlines such as Lufthansa or BA. Will definitely use them again in the future.
972,WAW-TXL-AUH-HKT-AUH-TXL-WAW. Flight from WAW to TXL on a new Bombardier Q400 short and smooth. Flights from TXL to AUH and from AUH to HKT on the A330-200 were half empty so it was very comfortable having 4 seats in the middle row to sleep all by myself. Same thing on the way back. Service was great as well I can't complain at all.
973,BRU-DUB-BRU. Airbus A320. Both flights on time. New planes with decent seat pitch. Attendants friendly and professional. Lots of information from the cockpit. Good value for money!
974,Dublin to JFK November 2011. Boarded Airbus A330 on time staff both pleasant and efficient ensuring a quick boarding had seat just behind bulkhead for business class. This area contains 12 or 14 seats and is worth paying extra for - comfortable and entertainment excellent. The flight was nice crew keeping us informed on route and weather etc meals passable at best! However on par with most other carriers from my experience overall a nice flight and felt well looked after.
975,"I was hesitant to book this airline going to Osaka due to the negative reviews here but it was the cheapest option. To my surprise, me and family did not have any negative experiences a lot of other commenters had. I'm 5'10 and found the seats to have average legroom just like any other airline I've flown. The crew were professional, helped out immediately when someone needed it, and served with a smile. The food to me was good, obviously not restaurant fancy, but good and filling. Drinks and bottled water, not tap, was offered every now and then. Although there is no screen in front of you to provide you with in-flight entertainment or location, they have an app that you can download on your Apple or Android where you can access some good movies from. I had no problem connecting to it and it kept me entertained for the long flight. Overall, I would fly with them again."
976,"Recently had a pleasure trip to Boston, Cape Cod and New York. Unfortunately before we left I broke my foot and was on crutches for the trip duration. We signed up for handicap assistance through Air Canada. They were our flight provider for every leg of our journey. I am so impressed with the service Air Canada provided. At every Check in, one or more Air Canada representatives were there with a wheelchair to transport me (with my 78 year young mom), to the next flight connection. Everyone who helped was courteous, experienced and efficient. It made the trip so much easier, and there were some very tight connections, especially in Toronto. Thank you so much for your outstanding service Air Canada. My only complaint is the new $20 baggage fee which is the only reason my review is a 9 instead of a full 10. I wish it did not exist"
977,Several day return flights DUB-LHR and DUB-MAN. Quite expensive in most cases as booked quite late but were either not much more expensive than Ryanair or less when you factor in that you would have to pay for priority boarding with Ryanair whereas can book a seat for free on Aer Lingus. But there's no comparison between the two. Very good experience and T2 at Dublin is a fantastic improvement on T1. AL have just launched a new Sky Cafe menu that looks tempting and very well presented although it is a bit misleading to be presenting the full Irish breakfast on bone china when it actually comes in a silver foil tray! Cabin crew without exception very professional and friendly although when I was standing at the back of the cabin waiting to disembark at Manchester it was a bit sad to hear two of them complaining about their jobs. It's not the same as it used to be. But given the choice I would choose AL over any of their competitors out of Dublin.
978,BHX-DUB return. I have flown this route with Ryanair and although it is marginally cheaper (Â£5 or so) Aer Lingus is worth it. Much more comfortable cabin and seats friendly staff and excellent service. Arrived to destination early.
979,"I went out of my way to take the new Air Canada Dreamliner and it was worth it. Although the Toronto to Copenhagen flight is relatively short - only 7 hours - it gave me a chance to experience the excellent new product and service. Business class has a spacious 1-2-1 layout in what AC calls private pods. Private they are for you very much feel isolated from the other passengers, which I appreciate. I love the 787 big windows. It makes you feel more connected to the exterior. I also loved the new IFE with a great touch-screen product. You can view your menu and all your wines on the screen. Food was superb - this time had an outstanding chicken tikka masala. The sparkling wine though, could be improved. It's too sweet for my liking. As is expected today, the seat converts to a fully-flat bed. When sleeping, perhaps the seat is still too high up for sometimes when turning around I would hit the front console with my hips. I don't have big hips. What I also loved about this pod is plenty of storage space. It was worthwhile to fly via Toronto to Europe from New York, just to avoid the American airlines."
980,"Even on this very short 65 min flight from New York to Toronto, Air Canada gets it right. The Embraer 190 has a spacious 1-2 business class layout, with comfy cushy seats. What impressed me most is that we had a proper meal-service which I very much appreciated. This is very rare in North American skies these days."
981,Very satisfied with my first long-distance trip on Air Berlin. Kind and humorous staff both on the planes and at the airports. The food was tasty and more than enough also plentiful drink runs. Then before the staff retires for about 2 hours one receives a small bottle of water-never had that happen before. As can be seen the staff presence is great throughout the flight. The Inflight Entertainment is good too although the TV series were a bit outdated. The plentiful amount of films made up for that again though. On the night flight we were given a large amenity kit with tooth brush and paste socks ear plugs and a eye mask. Only problem is the tiny seat pitch. Even if the person in front of you doesn't put back his chair your knees touch the seat in front of you.
982,DUB-MCO. Assisted to the whole family in getting seats at the front of economy class. Dublin is a very clean airport to fly through but I went with Aer Lingus before the big move to terminal 2. Terminal 1 is still very nice. During the flight the cabin crew were nice and food was lovely. All together a lovely flight.
983,DUB-ALC. Flew on an A320 both ways. Very high density and seats tight. Delay of 30 mins both ways. Very friendly staff and actually made you feel that you were important to them as a person not a customer. Food was lovely and landing was extremely smooth as usual.
984,"We were a bit apprehensive about flying with Canada Rouge given the amount of criticism it gets. But it offered the best direct option from Vegas to Calgary. Our 737 flight was full, but the coordinated boarding process got everyone aboard quite quickly. Service was attentive - the FAs look over-casual, but the guy who looked after my wife was good with pillows and blanket. Perfect 10/10 landing in Calgary - complimented the co-pilot on his effort. We also flew Vancouver to LA in an upgraded 767. Again, full plane, but luggage space and legroom quite adequate. Entertainment via iPads."
985,"I just wanted to recount the excellent customer service I received regarding an unfortunate circumstance concerning a return trip to Aruba from Toronto last year. The agent at the ticket counter should be complimented on his empathy and understanding. However, I should also mention that I was disappointed when no attempt was made to inform me about changes made to the flight, especially since the departing flight from Toronto was delayed by one day. In spite of this disappointment I would continue to fly Air Canada."
986,AUH - HKT and return as part of Etihad codeshare. Out in old business class configuration and return in new configuration which is the same as Etihad's business class. Food and beverage offer was not quite as sophisticated as Etihad's but not far from it and I found the food to be very tasty and well presented. The staff were also good in my opinion - being warm and attentive. The old business class seat would not be that comfortable for sleeping on an overnight flight but the layout actually worked well for a daytime flight. IFE was good with enough variety and choice to keep most people happy. All in all I was quite impressed and would be happy to fly their long haul business class product again!
987,Dub to Madrid. Late departure due to passengers trying to take over sized bags onboard. Gate crew did a professional job of trying to take bags from people who should have known better. An almost full flight handled professionally by a competent crew. Nice Hot Irish Breakfast from the Buy on Board menu and regular updates from Captain during the trip. A great mid way service in terms of getting what you pay for with the care from the crew equivalent to that of any full service airline.
988,DUB-LIN and BLQ-DUB. M Wickham's comments re: Venice are interesting. I had the same experience flying back from Bologna where the captain made reference to problems on the ground. Took an age to get people to the gate and onto the buses to the plane. No reason for it. Just typical Italian laid back attitude. Still made up time on the way back and only ended up 5 mins late. Both flights were fine on time clean aircraft and friendly FA's.
989,Air Canada is known for poor food and very poor entertainment options (the television programs are very limited and don't change regularly) but the seats are good in economy and excellent when you have a flight with the pod configuration in business.
990,"We travelled Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge to Italy in June/July 2015. For once, we have very positive things to say about Air Canada. Air Canada Rouge was very comfortable for the longer flights overseas - even offering meals, snacks, blankets and pillows. The inflight entertainment we used on our own Apple devices worked very well, and there was one plug in our seat area for charging. It was nice to be able to choose our seats ahead of time with no charges as well. The most positive thing we have to say about our flights is that I accidentally left my ipad mini on board our very last flight going into Halifax. The flight attendant went out of her way to turn my ipad into lost and found and even emailed me telling me this. It had ended up in St John's, NFLD, where we arranged pick up to have it returned to us. We received it a couple of days later. I am very thankful and grateful to her and the other employees in lost and found who made sure I received my ipad back! As far as I'm concerned, they went above and beyond."
991,Air Berlin from TXL to VCE and back. Everything went extremely smoothly. Free seat next to me (as a Topbonus Gold member) pre-ordered food was on board and very nice (Indian vegetarian curry) cabin crew very friendly and professional both flights a few minutes ahead of schedule luggage among the first 5 bags on belt. Air Berlin at its best!
992,We came prepared we flew from LAX to DUS. Flight was smooth and food ok. Crew was just like every other flight crew. We took a tape measure and measures the seats front to back and side to side. The seats are the same on all the different airlines we flew except for jet blue which had a 1 inch larger seat. The reason why the seats seem close is because they recline to a greater degree.
993,DUB-VCE-DUB. Outward flight punctual but return over 1 hr late departing. The pilot said that the reason for the delay was a 'long story' and that he didn't want to go into blame mode whilst heavily hinting at service agent problems in Venice. Pilots informative during the flights and cabin crew helpful.
994,DUB-BCN-DUB. Flights on time crew professional and courteous seat pitch good. Dublin departure from Terminal 1 which was a 10 min walk from security at T2 and the flight to DUB left BCN from the far end of the terminal there - so another 10min or so walk.
995,JFK-DUB-MAN return. Staff were friendly and helpful. Flights on time or early. Food typical airline quality but edible. I ordered vegetarian special which were delivered. A330-300 clean and adequate space and comfortable seat. The movies offered adequate variety. Only downside I was told that I needed to be at MAN 3.5hrs before departure. I called both the airline and the airport and was assured that this was necessary and check-in would be open at this early hour. So I was not thrilled to arrive at the airport to have to wait for 1hr before the desk opened. US Customs clearance and transiting in Dublin was easy but a lot of walking involved. I would highly recommend Aer Lingus. My fare was $500 cheaper than the best competitor on the same dates.
996,"Was worried that this would be awful but it was just fine. No issues, flight attendants were very polite, smiled and passed through the cabin 3 times during our 6 hour flight. This flight to HNL was better on Air Canada Rouge than the WestJet one we took last year. Could not beat the price."
997,"All 4 flights were on time and Air Canada product shames every US carrier, especially in Economy. Every seat has free IFE which was adequate for SFO-YUL and YUL-LHR sectors, but it could be more extensive for longer flights in AC's network. Food was for purchase on North American flights and complementary food on the transatlantic flights was okay. The crew on all flights were very friendly, although I found the Montreal-based crews to be slightly warmer than their Vancouver-based colleagues. I would definitely fly with Air Canada again."
998,"ZRH-CFU-ZRH. Flight out left on time very nice crew and efficient. They served you a sandwich which was tasteless and a free soft drink. They offered from the menu ""Onboard Cafe"" against payment. Since the flight was only a bit more than 1.5 hours the sandwich was ok. Flight back 30 minutes delayed - not the airlines fault. Again very nice and attentive crew same sort of sandwich offered on the way back. For short flights Air Berlin is fine."
999,Flew Dusseldorf to Kos a Greek Island for holiday. Check was not able to take a sun umbrella as luggage only after discussion we were able to check it in. Boarding was via bus but ok. Seats nice but special. Food service was a sandwich and soft drinks. Bought from the Sansibar list a Currywurst (sausage) with a roll and a beer. This was nice and good. Flight landed 3 hours later on time. Crew was nice and friendly. Cockpit informed us about the flight. Would fly them again but Check in needs to improve.
1000,JFK-DUB-LGW return Y Class. Purchased emergency exit seats for transatlantic sectors. Seats comfortable with extra legroom and FA on JFK-DUB supplied additional blankets. Food simple but adequate service charming and caring. Three hour delay at JFK so missed connection to LGW impressed with EI's handling and were rebooked on next flights while in the air new boarding cards with breakfast vouchers awaiting our arrival at DUB.
1001,Glasgow-JFK via Dublin. All flights on time and clearing US customs and border protection in Dublin was an unexpected bonus. The seats and inflight entertainment was above average. However the bar service was only offered once during a 7.5 hour flight. I asked the stewardess if the drinks trolley would be making another appearance or if I could purchase a beer and she told me I could just have tea or coffee.
1002,ORD-DUB-CDG A330 ORD-DUB A320 DUB-CDG. Aircraft clean and bright. Transfer at DUB smooth and easy. FA's ORD-DUB were curt but efficient. Food acceptable but not as good as other European carriers. ORD-DUB we were served a small snack (pretzels) dinner and a croissant sandwich. There is only one beverage plus coffee/tea service on international flights and alcohol must be purchased. DUB-CDG there is no complimentary beverage or meal/snack service (all may be purchased). DUB-ORD also went well - FA's much more attentive and friendly. Beware that Aer Lingus has lower baggage-weight allowance than most carriers - only 23kg for long-haul flights. I ordered vegetarian meals (ON AerLingus.com) but FA's on the first flight said that they had no record of this request. I reminded the gate agent on the last leg of my trip but I was again told that there was no record of my request on the return trip.
1003,"First time flying with Air Canada Rouge, we were flying out from Montego Bay, Jamaica to Toronto, Canada. It is approx. 4 hour flight, the seats were nice and space was plenty. I am about a 5'9 height, so it was plenty for me, but for my partner who is 6'1, he had plenty of room to stretch out and relax. The service that was unparalleled, our flight attendant was exactly what her title states - very attentive not only for myself and partner but for everybody else around her. She was very knowledgeable in regards to food menu, beverages provided and even had held her own when another passenger requested for a specific cocktail, that she knew how to whip up. This caught the requesting passenger off guard, funny moment. The complementary Ipads being offered were a nice touch, not needed but it is always nice to have options, and flying in the J cabin with Air Canada Rouge was well worth it all. My only complaint was if you were sitting in the last row in J cabin, there's a curtain to section you off from the rest of the aircraft except for a hole between you and the person beside you, ie. the arm rest area, there is a large hole for someone from behind you to peep and see through, personally, it is a minor detail but I can imagine a person who has business or work to do would appreciate the complete privacy instead of having that large gap. That being said, the service and cabin was amazing, and is highly recommended for everyone to try with Air Canada Rouge."
1004,"We flew 2 legs via AC Rouge (one 9 hours, and the other 5 hrs). The 9 hour leg we had excellent inflight service - the stewardesses were very attentive, responsive, and helpful, ensuring we had a very comfortable flight."
1005,"Tired B777-300ER. Most B773s are sparkling new, this must have been one of the originals. Crew was delightful, food was average. Would consider Air Canada slightly better than US-based airlines but not world class by any means."
1006,"Had a nice experience on this short haul. On a 1.5 hour flight there was a TV screen with movies and shows for free if you bring your own headsets. Free drinks and snack. Better than any domestic service. Check-in convenient. Good recognition of Star alliance gold, allowed me access to lounge though I am a United gold and allowed free check in. Flight was overbooked, but got into the flight due to my status."
1007,My first time with Air Canada. Refitted Boeing 777 with 3-4-3 layout. Fine as I had a seat empty next to me but it would be squashed when full. I had a 3-3-3 layout on the way home and was glad of the extra space. Flight was fine - slightly un-engaging and sloppy staff (one spilt water over me and didn't even notice). Food was awful though - low quality and very little of it. The Kosher meals served around me though looked huge and tasty! I'd say BA Economy is a better bet overall.
1008,BFS-LHR-BFS A320. Fully boarded 20 mins before departure on return leg so efficient turn around. Crew friendly and pretty decent service on both legs. Both legs busy - 19.20 from LHR full on return leg. Looks like EI are doing well on this route but have still reduced to 3 flights a day for winter.
1009,LHR-BFS-LHR A320 with decent legroom. Friendly crews. For return leg the inbound flight was delayed 15 minutes (Heathrow and weather). However a very quick turnaround and boarding by front and rear steps rather than the usual seat row number system.
1010,GLA-DUB-ORL return. Service was great and I really liked the seats. Food was good and for the price an excellent service. Would use again. A word of caution Dublin airport is very confusing. The US pre-clearance is excellent but you cannot return to the lounge and we didn't appreciate this.
1011,Travel Dublin to London every week. The aircraft's are comfortable the food choice good and the cabin crew professional and friendly. Gold circle lounges are well stocked. The only complaint I would have is if you are on a flight after 18.00 out of Dub there is normally a member of staff mopping the floor something I feel should be saved for after the lounge is closed.
1012,"If you investigate Rouge in advance, and consider this to be Air Canada's vacation tier product, I think you will be fine with the level of service and comfort. I have seen complaints about the premium economy seats on these flights - these are definitely not to be compared to business class. They are larger but still economy style seats (no lie flat, no pods etc.) I have status with Air Canada (which did not do much for me on this flight except for a faster luggage drop off.) I was flying with 2 other couples and a 1 year child, for whom a seat was purchased. Seat comfort: I upgraded to a seat with more legroom (Rouge Plus - not Premium Economy, just a seat with more legroom in economy). There was sufficient legroom for the flight - better than the Air Canada Boeing 777 with 3-4-3 seating which I will not take again unless forced to. I would not fly to Europe in a Rouge regular economy seat as these are very tight. A pillow and blanket were supplied as part of the seating without extra charge. I was comfortable enough to sleep. Meals: Dinner (Chicken, quinoa salad, one roll, some kind of dessert) or pasta (did not select) is included on the flight to Lisbon outbound from Toronto as well as a slice of banana bread about 1 hour before arrival. Two or three drink services (two on the overnight flight and three during the day). Meals are included on transatlantic flights - you must pay for alcohol and only credit cards are acceptable. Quality was comparable to Air Canada Economy class,  which is to say, barely acceptable, but edible and hot. Meal on return was chicken or pasta - quality of meal was better. Snack provided was a hot chicken or vegetarian wrap. Edible. (Flew Rouge from Toronto to Las Vegas and on these flights you have to pay for food). Flight crew: Young, but very helpful especially with the baby and the car seat. Checked twice to see that the seat was approved (which is important to everyone). Service was decent. Communication: Our outbound flight was delayed 3 hours due to someone deploying an emergency chute while the plane was on the ground. Communication wasn't great but I did find out the reason by speaking nicely to a person on the desk. Announcements were made twice that we had a $10 credit to spend in the terminal on food. Not a lot, but at least we only had to show our boarding pass to get the credit, so did not have to line up for a voucher. Inflight entertainment: Runs on iPad (your own or one you can rent for $10) or some Android devices. Had no problems with Android on this trip (did have on a previous trip, so they may have fixed this). One plane had universal plug/usb outlets for charging, but one did not, so I wouldn't count on this. A reasonable selection of movies for a 7 hour flight. We all arrived safely, our luggage arrived as well, there was enough on board storage for carry on luggage now that Air Canada is enforcing the size restrictions on carry on luggage (something I approve of) and it all was relatively uneventful. Overall I would fly Rouge again but only in a Rouge Plus seat. It is convenient not to have to transfer in say Frankfurt to get to less travelled destinations in Europe like Lisbon. I like the non stop flights that are offered by Rouge. You need to understand however that this is not the top tier product and you are paying for a lesser product but not having to stop anywhere."
1013,"We travelled Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge to Italy in June/July 2015. For once, we have very positive things to say about Air Canada. Air Canada Rouge was very comfortable for the longer flights overseas - even offering meals, snacks, blankets and pillows. The inflight entertainment we used on our own Apple devices worked very well, and there was one plug in our seat area for charging. It was nice to be able to choose our seats ahead of time with no charges as well. The most positive thing we have to say about our flights is that I accidentally left my ipad mini on board our very last flight going into Halifax. The flight attendant went out of her way to turn my ipad into lost and found and even emailed me telling me this. It had ended up in St John's, NFLD, where we arranged pick up to have it returned to us. We received it a couple of days later. I am very thankful and grateful to her and the other employees in lost and found who made sure I received my ipad back! As far as I'm concerned, they went above and beyond."
1014,LGW-Malaga return Economy. Booked online so downloaded my boarding pass 24 hours before flight which with only hand luggage made things simple and fast at Gatwick. Plane was A320 clean tidy and staff were friendly and helpful. Onboard food and drinks were quite expensive seats surprisingly wide and comfortable flight took off and landed on time. Return flight was hampered by not being able to download my boarding pass so no fast track  I had to queue at Malaga for over 1 hr and the flight was delayed for 30 mins but because of tailwinds we arrived at Gatwick 10 mins early.
1015,MAN to DUB then onto Boston return in Economy. A330/A320 both on time. Cabin Crew friendly and efficient. Food onboard was ok. Seat back TV's a bonus. The legroom was comfortable for a 6 hr flight.
1016,BOS-DUB and DUB-AMS. Flew A330/A320. Found the flights professional. FA fairly friendly and attended to needs. Had one get me warm milk for my baby whilst another did not return with an ice cup. Meals okay on first flight need to pay for the second. Baggage free for one luggage second flight was part of KLM codeshare and also free. Planes clean and arrived on time. A330 arm rests did not recline fully so difficult to lie flat.
1017,Amsterdam-Dublin and Malaga-London Gatwick. Staff have been professional and polite although I noticed some of the staff do not have English as their first language and could try harder to communicate more efficiently. One all of the flights I took departure was roughly on time and although in the budget category of airline Aer Lingus offers a good alternative to the more expensive carriers. I do not like the policy of charging for bags and found the website rather unfriendly - the latter is my only real concern. The new terminal in Dublin is very welcoming too. As a non-EU citizen the process of gaining UK and Irish tourism visas was hard and the Schengen visa regime is also very complex and appears to be applied in a random manner. Although not the fault of check-in staff more information should be provided to the staff to enable them to more politely deal with non-EU customers when checking in for flights.
1018,Dublin to Barcelona return. Had to get up at 3 in the morning for the 6.40 flight to Barcelona for a cruise. Terminal 2 at Dublin is very spacious and modern but unfortunately we found ourselves taking a long walk over to T1 for our flight. Very nice flight food was lovely - I recommend if you are flying in the morning to get the Irish Fry. Staff were friendly except for one person who was a bit rude but all in all a nice flight which landed 10 mins early. Same story returning but there was a delay at check-in at Barcelona because there was something wrong with the toe for the bags but when walking to security we passed a new modern and deserted check-in area not in use. Other than that 2 nice on time flights.
1019,"Lufthansa marketed the flights I purchased and I was shocked to find out in the small print that we were flying Air Canada Rouge. We flew from Newark connecting through Montreal to Rome on June 27. The return trip was Venice through Montreal to Newark on July 5. Jazz provided service on the Newark/Montreal legs. We did not experience any of the problems that other travelers mentioned. We were served hot meals that were actually good, as far as plane food goes. The plane appeared to be in good condition and clean. We downloaded the in flight app ahead of time. The movies were old and there could be a better selection. The cabin temperature was adequate. Each seat had a blanket and pillow. We saved $600 using Air Canada and were very pleased. I would definitely fly on Rouge in the future."
1020,"YYZ to ZRH on Boeing 787 in economy with my wife and infant. Check in staff in Toronto very helpful and the line moved quickly. Boarding and flight departure on time. I am 6'4"" and flying economy I was worried about leg room as I was unable to reserve a preferred seat. Air Canada Boeing 787 cabin was clean and felt open with the lighting and larger windows. I was surprised at the amount of leg room there was in an economy seat, as so many people have stated it was poor. My knees did touch the seat in front of myself however I was able to extend them under the seat with no problem. My wife being much shorter had plenty of room. I would suggest when travelling with an infant to take advantage of the bassinet seat as we did on the return flight. The seats are slightly narrow. The inflight entertainent was great having your own personal screen to watch numerous movies and TV shows. The only issue with these is that there is a ""remote"" control located on the arm rests. The buttons are usually pressed by the person sitting beside you which will cause your seat light and functions on the entertainment screen to be activated (sucks when watching a movies and volume keeps going up and down). The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful and service with a smile. Our first flight they even attempted to have people give up the bassinet seat to allow us to sit there. We had a great expirence flying with AC and will use them again in the future for sure. And on a side note the pasta served for the meal is much better than the chicken."
1021,"I recently traveled YWG-LHR and returned home from EDI-YWG with AC Rouge. I must say I was pleasantly surprised with how well the trip went in both directions. Outbound flight was delayed about 2 hours due to maintenance, staff kept us updated and were very pleasant. After the aircraft couldn't be fixed they quickly changed to a spare Boeing 777 in YYZ and got us going as quick as they could. Meals on board were not bad, only suggestion would be the continental breakfast could be improved. Seats were comfortable and service was good even though a full flight. Returned on Air Canada Rouge in Premium, seat was adequate, food was good but flight attendants need more training and need to act more professional. Priority bag was first off the carousel and connection was perfect, flights on time no complaints."
1022,"Check in was chaotic due to bag drop desks being used for full check in. Baggage once tagged had to go to a separate area to be weighed thus taking the staff away from their desk. By the time we got through security the flight had boarded but there were a number of stragglers who boarded after us and delayed the flight. Seating in row 20 was good for a long haul flight with AVOD which was a step up from Air Canada rouge and the options were reasonably up to date with a decent choice. Toilets were also a good size. Service was fine but food was a disgrace - it was described to me as the Asian option, presumably because it was served with rice. The second meal was no better, inbetween these meals was a large sandwich stuffed full of chicken,  the odd water run now and then. Does not compare favourably with the competition on this route, even Air Canada rouge via Osaka is a better option."
1023,MUC-TLV and return several times. Planes always clean staff friendly food ok. Sometimes they do weigh your luggage but 1-2kg overweight were ok. Arrival in TLV in the late night/early morning definitively recommended as passport control is considerably faster.
1024,AMS-ORK in A320s. Both flights were on time and the cabin crew friendly. In this respect they exceeded my expectations. The planes looked relatively new although on the return trip the cleaners seemed to have missed areas. The range of food/drink for purchase is excellent although the alcohol is expensive for what you get. The only real complaint is the horrible departure times they offer on this route.
1025,EDI-DUB-MCO return. All flights on time on all sectors of the journey. Flying Business Class has access to the Aer Lingus lounge in Dublin. Comfortable seating areas with the usual selection of snacks and drinks. Pre-clearance into the USA is an absolute positive if you fly via Dublin as once you arrive in the USA you pick up your bags and you're all set to go. Inflight service was excellent both ways. Attentive cabin crew who seemed genuinely happy to greet you. Pre-flight drinks were followed by hot and cold canapÃ©s and a substantial 3 course meal. Cabin crew continually topped up wine and water glasses without request. Seats are great in recline position and my only minor criticism would be that the flat bed is at an angle. Feels like you're about to slip of the seat however this is only a minor complaint in terms of the great service provided. If you compare the price of business class with other airlines flying to Orlando this is a great ticket especially if you book in advance.
1026,Cork to London Heathrow return. Once again a professional and friendly service provided both flights on time good selection of food and drink for sale. There seems to be an improvement in service over recent years offering great value for money and a decent quality of service.
1027,Manchester to JFK via Dublin. Flight from Manchester to Dublin was delayed for 1 hr through no fault of Aer Lingus. They held the plane for us at Dublin and as soon as we arrived we were personally ushered straight through passport control and US customs. I was impressed the flight attendants friendly and helpful the food good and the inflight entertainment was excellent.
1028,"The reviews for Air Canada Rouge weren't good, so was a bit apprehensive when heading home on a Rouge flight (Rouge was the only option for the Dublin to Toronto return flight). We flew Economy (Dublin-Toronto) and it was a great flight. The flight attendants were friendly and smartly dressed. The interior cabin fabric seemed new. The seats weren't too roomy but they didn't feel too small either. The meals were standard fare for my family, decent, although my vegetarian meal (an Indian vegan dish) had to be the best meal I've ever had on any Economy flight, domestic or international. We were pretty much on-time departing and arriving. The in-flight entertainment was a bit laughable, but we had read up on it and knew that going in. It was funny to see such old Hollywood movies available on the Rouge Player (one of the movies was Never Ending Story!). I am a big fan of world movies and some of the world movies were the same as the ones on the Air Canada flight we took to London when we left on our vacation. Our family would definitely try another flight with Rouge again."
1029,"Flew from Vancouver YVR to Sydney NS YQY via Montreal YUL and Halifax YHZ. First segment from YVR to YUL was an overnight flight on an A320. Received help from YVR ground crew since this was my first air travel in Canada. The flight took off and landed on time. Cabin crew on board was good at communication and drinks were served. However no meal was served for a 5-hr flight, which was to my surprise (and then I knew that AC simply does not do that on domestic flights no matter short-haul or long-haul). En-route entertainment system was a nice touch and there were programmes for different ages and culture. Seat was not an issue since I was seated in an exit row. Second segment from YUL to YHZ was on an E190, which was one of the most comfortable single-aisle aircraft in my opinion. Had entertainment system as well. Also, only drinks were served. This time I was seated in a normal row and the seat pitch was just enough to accomodate myself (6'2"" and 240lbs). Third segment was also a short one from YHZ to YQY, operated by Jazz on a 30 years old DeHavilland DHC8-100 (Dash8) turboprop. Cabin attendant was friendly and served drinks and snacks. Seat pitch was even tighter this time but since the seat cushion was shortened, there was still enough room to seat myself. Overall my first travel with AC was satisfying, but next time I'll make sure I'm not hungry before boarding."
1030,"We flew Ottawa-Toronto-San Francisco and returned Los Angeles-Toronto-Ottawa, business class on all trips. The flights to and from Toronto to Ottawa were uneventful. The food served was a fruit plate. The flight to San Francisco was OK except for the fact that by the time that the FA got to be he said that he was all out of meat, fish, and chicken and the only thing he had left was pasta. I am on a low carb diet so I ate very little. In fact, he told me that I should eat salad. On the flight from Los Angeles, there were sufficient meals so that I had my choice. The FA here was very pleasant and accommodating. In general, Air Canada business class for North America is nothing special with seats that do not provide a lot more room than economy and the food is only the middle of the road. I question the economic worthiness of the North American business class."
1031,Miami-Berlin. Took flight on a one way basis as return dates were subject to change. I am a top tier AA flier and the addition to Air Berlin gives some good connection options. Aircraft was a new Airbus with standard seat pitch and seat comfort in economy was uncomfortable. The IFE is good with each seat having independent controls and a reasonable selection of movies etc. Unfortunately the selection is via a touch screen buried in your seat back and the Neanderthal behind me felt that instead of lightly touching the screen they had to indent their finger into the screen - constant tap tap into my seat that precluded any chance of sleep. Food average drinks average FA's average. Despite being top tier no way to select seat on line - had to call in advance and their website is poor.
1032,BUD-TXL-AUH on 14 May 2013 (and AUH-BKK with Etihad). Everything was OK. So smooth. But beware - on TXL there is no toilet in waiting room behind the passport control. Onboard I met the funniest staff I have ever travelled with. The food was good and tasty. The seat comfort was better average. The IFE was good (better than on Etihad). The price for the ticket was excellent.
1033,Paris (Orly) - Berlin (Tegel) short haul flight and very pleased with this airline. Plane was a fairly new 737-700 comfortable clean nice lighting and professional attendants. On time departure well maybe 5 minutes late but arrived in Berlin ahead of schedule. Nice snacks and beverages at no cost. All in all I do recommend this airline from my experience.
1034,DUB-GVA one way. Smooth Terminal 2 less hassle at check-in airport check-in machines instead of printing your own boarding pass etc. It was a nice relaxed flight on time and the queues were fast-moving. It's not quite the level of other carriers but the premium you're paying for is smoothness and calm.
1035,DUB to BOS return in Economy. Both flights on A330 and both left and arrived on schedule. Staff friendly and efficient and the food was ok. Seat back TV's gave plenty of personal entertainment although the touch screen was not very responsive and you could feel the person behind you giving their screen a good hard press. I didn't find the seat particularly comfortable but ok for a short-ish transatlantic flight. Dublin airport was good my only complaint being that we didn't pre-clear customs in Dublin. Boston immigration was as usual a disgrace. We were near the front of the queue and still took more than 30mins to clear.
1036,DUB-ORD in Business Class. Excellent service once again - provided by professional and attentive cabin crew throughout the flight. The onboard dining experience was just perfect. IFE options have been updated in the past twelve months and are very broad. All luggage arrived promptly at ORD and we were out of the terminal within 20 minutes of landing.
1037,"Toronto to Abbotsford was a long flight in terms of domestic travel. About 5 hours gate to gate. While Rouge does offer in-flight entertainment for free, you need to rent an I-pad to watch movies unless you have your own. I purchased a couple of movies the night before the flight and uploaded them to my SD card for my phone. A lot of people complain about the seats on Rouge, and I somewhat agree with them.  The only thing I would say that Rouge needs to improve is the overall comfort of the seats and they would be a great Low Cost Carrier. On the flight, we had 3 amazing crew. The overall flight was uneventful, and the decent into Abbotsford was amazing! I would fly Rouge again and again just for the reason that its affordable and if you do your homework, you can save yourself some money as well as have the same experience you would have a major carrier."
1038,"I was very pleased by service received at all stages of travel. Well-organised boarding, very friendly stewards, and a smooth flight. Stewards went an extra mile to make a rather lengthy flight comfortable and enjoyable. They seemed to enjoy their work too. "
1039,"Booked through AC Vacations and my wife and I got a great deal on a package for three nights in Jamaica. For the overall value, we were actually pretty happy. I'm 6'3 and yes, the seats have a medieval aesthetic which meant the person in front literally had no chance of reclining their seat and I spent the trip with one leg in the aisle when possible. For four hours, though, I can suck it up and enjoy decent service from the 3 flight attendants. Paying for food, booze and iPads is relatively good value as well. We found it on par with Sunwing and, as always, better than United Airlines."
1040,"My wife and I live in the U.P. of Michigan. On May 19th we flew out of Sault Ste. Marie, Canada to Toronto then to Frankfurt, Germany then onto Helsinki, Finland. Our return trip after spending time in Finland visiting family and
friends we left Helsinki to Munich, Germany to Toronto then back to Sault Ste. Marie then home. This was our first
time flying with Air Canada so we didn't know what to expect but we were very pleased with the whole experience. We recommended it to others."
1041,JFK to Dusseldorf to Nice - round-trip. Flight was punctual cabin very clean. Food service and beverage was executed very well. Attendants were courteous and helpful. Flight was smooth as well as landing and take off. Baggage transferred and unloaded quite quickly. We were impressed. We have been crossing the Atlantic for over twenty years. I recommend Air Berlin. We would give the poor rating to seat comfort in Economy Class to any airline in today's world.
1042,Dublin-Boston return. Enjoyed the new seats and IFE on demand. Aircraft clean and in good condition. Outward cabin crew friendly and professional. Food typical economy fare but edible. Return cabin crew friendly but a little rushed due to shortness of flight under 5 hrs. Only gripe is the pricing of alcoholic drinks. Pre-clearance of American immigration and customs in Dublin a major bonus. 15 mins from plane to bus out of Boston airport.
1043,LGW-DUB return. Online booking worked fine and was convenient. I didn't book any bag so got 2 flights for a very fair price at short notice. Â£10 seat surcharge looked unavoidable and wasn't fairly explained as optional. Printed my boarding pass at home and breezed through the airport. Pre-clearance at the gate was done professionally as well as onboard welcome. Plane was tidy uncomfortable seats with not enough legroom. Service was professional however food and drink offerings looked pricey. It didn't matter as flight time was just 45 mins. Return flight was about the same both flights on time. Good value for money. Seat improvement would be appreciated.
1044,Boston to Shannon recently. The service was excellent flight attendants were warm and pleasant. The food was very good along with the wines. I will continue to fly Aer Lingus.
1045,Chicago to Dublin return in Economy. Orderly boarding in Chicago for a full flight. Friendly and efficient cabin crew who were nicely presented. A lot of babies and small children on this flight but it was nice to see they helped families get settled quickly. Food good quality and lots of water runs during the night. Seatback entertainment very good. Immigration and baggage all fast at Dublin.
1046,"Flew from New York to Beijing via Toronto in May and coming back June 11th. I was badly surprised by the lack of professionalism of Air Canada FA. I was spoilt with hot liquids, water and juice 3 times during the flight from Beijing to Toronto, by different FA. Full flight both times, no smiles and kindness from any of the flight attendants, they were rude and seem to be very upset with some of the passengers. Our flight from PEK-YYZ was delayed due to two passengers missing, and while waiting on board, one of the FA's over the microphone said ""Perhaps we should give a round applause to the two passengers missing"". I find this very disrespectful and inappropriate. Overall, not a pleasant flight, rude cabin crew who shouted for people to remain seated, they didnt seem to care for passengers and they we were just doing their job with minimum standards. Very disappointing experience with Air Canada."
1047,"Flew on AC992 from MEX to YYZ. Plane an average A319, took off punctually. The check in service was smooth and very quick yet I had already printed my boarding pass at home. The cabin crew was very attentive, served drinks at several time during the flight. Only the water seemed to be undrinkable because it tasted like pure chlorine. The leg room on the aircraft was not the best for a 4:30h flight. Baggage drop off at Toronto Pearson quick and efficient. I think I would fly Air Canada again, even if the experience was not more than average."
1048,Copenhagen to Berlin and Berlin to Paris 28 May and return 5 June Paris to Berlin and Berlin to Copenhagen. Sceptical as the tickets were relatively cheap. Surprised by the excellent service: all flights were clean and well maintained we got a free drink snacks free newspapers and the leg space was reasonable. While leaving the flight we got Air Berlin chocolates from staff with a smile. Staff were kind. Overall I had a very nice and experience and would travel them again.
1049,AB gets the short haul service right. Both the outbound and the return flight (same day) on time clean well maintained 737s. Generous newspaper/magazine offer in the boarding area at TXL somewhat less generous at DUS. Efficient and friendly on board service with a choice of a sweet (candy bar) or a salty (small bag of sesame saltines) miniature snack and a drinks run they are always gladly serving both a hot and a cold drink wine and beer included at no charge. The friendly and obviously motivated staff a big plus. Legroom scarce but not a big issue on 45 minute flights. Absolutely my choice again for the next intra-German flight if the fare is right.
1050,Dublin-Chicago and on to PDX return. I was on my own with a 22 month old I hadn't bought my child a seat so she was supposed to sit in my lap. However flights were half empty so she got her own seat which was great. Planes were generally clean and in good condition - great seat back entertainment (330). Flight attendants were helpful and attentive. One flight was delayed an hour lots of communication provided.
1051,I have had 12 return flights this year to the US Brussels London and Amsterdam. The move to T2 in Dublin has resulted in a great product. Ground staff in Dublin are great giving some recognition to Gold Circle members is welcome. However we have encountered some inconsistencies/lack of professionalism from some crew. I am confident these minor issues can be resolved. Overall the product is improving.
1052,Dublin to Faro outward flight left slightly late however time was made up in the air. Both flights full cabin crew couldn't do enough for you.
1053,Cork to LHR return. Flights left on time friendly crew on both sectors good selection of food and drinks for sale at reasonable prices cabin fresh and clean.
1054,"I think this carrier gets a very unfair rap. First flight was YVR to SFO on A319. I had no trouble fitting into my seat space. For flights of 2-3 hours it is perfectly fine. We didn't purchase any food. Return from LAX was on B767 which operates also the Osaka-YVR route. I really have no issues with Rouge unlike the parent company with whom we rounded off our latest north American trip. The entertainment on our ipad was the same as our flight from Japan, but we managed to find something."
1055,"YUL-LHR-YYZ-MEX in Economy. It is always a pleasure to travel with such a professional airline. Cabin crew members are always really good. I did the YUL-LHR on May the 7th and I was on one of the newer Boeing 777-300ER with 3x4x3 abreast economy class. The cabin was new and spotless, seats were really comfortable and inflight entertainment was excellent. Service was really good, but the second meal was only a very bad slice of cake. LHR-YYZ was on an older 777-300ER with 3x3x3 abreast economy on May 26th. I could not perceive any difference in width between the inbound and the outbound flights. Most of the cabin crew on board this flight were the best AC bunch I have had in a while, there was one that was very nasty to a passenger whose English could not be understood easily. Finally, the YYZ-MEX leg on an Airbus 319 was a breeze as the cabin was almost empty. I had encountered the CSM working in this flight before, and I have to say he does know how to co-ordinate a team. Air Canada does not offer free meals in its flights to Mexico anymore, but I prefer them over the competition because they are a no-nonsense airline with hard-working."
1056,AC761 to San Francisco AC 760 to Montreal. May 26 - June 2. I flew from Montreal to San Francisco on May 26 The plane was clean and the staff were really friendly and experienced. The entertainment system had some good selections. Overall its was a great flight my only complaint is that this is a 6 hour flight yet they still make you pay for food which I find is not fair since I flew Montreal-London in December and its a shorter flight yet you still get a meal.
1057,My wife and I flew Ottawa to Vancouver return. All the planes were full. The positive was that the airline crew were friendly enough and worked well together on all flights. On the way there we flew threw Montreal and boarded an A330-300. A nice big plane with 2-4-2 which works well for couples. On the way back we flew direct on a smaller A320 with 3 and 3 seating. The back of the plane felt very warm and all the restrooms are at the back so there is always a constant flow of people. Air Canada does a good job of providing seat back screens to their fleet. Movie choices were acceptable but regular TV either wasn't available or the selection was poor. The food and beverage cart went by twice and water was offered more often. Nothing is free except the water and soft drinks. I should mention Air Canada has improved it's telephone waiting times considerably.
1058,"Dusseldorf-Berlin-St Petersburg. We checked in easily at the machine. At bag drop our Russian visas were very carefully checked. Boarding smooth for the first flight and our bulkhead seats on the A321 had plenty of legroom. A drink and a very bready pastry were served. Crew were efficient and the plane operated on time. Bussed to the terminal at Tegel. The boarding of the flight to St Petersburg was poor. Although there are dedicated gates for flights to Russia there is no signage or information to indicate that before reporting to the gate you have to have your Russian visa checked (again) at a desk labelled simply ""Air Berlin service"". To enter the departure lounge you have to pass through passport control. As we could see that the lounge had no toilets and not having been informed about the need to have our visa checked again we and many others decided not to go into the lounge until just before boarding time. At that time we were directed to join a long queue where a single employee was slowly checking visas. All the while Air Berlin announcements were telling people to board the plane immediately as it was about to depart! The whole mess could be avoided by clear signage and information. Once on board the A320 the seating and basic lunch were fine for a 2.5 hr flight - although loud chatter and giggling among crew in the galley during descent was a bit unprofessional. Again we were bussed to the terminal."
1059,CPH-DUS CGN-LPA in April 2013. Flights on time decent service with a snack and non-alcoholic beverage CPH-DUS. CGN-LPA a filling sandwich served with same beverages as above. Both flights were good service efficient but a little mechanic. Air Berlin-chocolates given upon disembarkation of each flight. All in all a decent product in today's aviation market.
1060,Edinburgh for a flight to Dublin to connect to JFK return. The cabin crew on all flights were very good. Outbound staff were friendly and professional and nothing was a problem. Very informative about New York and places of interest. Excellent service. Return flight also excellent.
1061,Business class with my son service was wonderful. The seat was comfortable and food was very nice. I lost my bracelet down the back of the seat and the stewardess was on her hands and knees looking for it she couldn't reach it and 5 minutes after landing in Dublin a maintenance worker came on board took the seat apart and retrieved my bracelet.
1062,After booking at such a low fare I was a bit worried but my fears were unfounded. We boarded a very well maintained new Boeing 757 in Chicago for our trip to Dublin and Amsterdam. Two good quality hot airline meals individual LCD flat panels on each seat back with free movies shows and navigation displays. When our departure in Chicago was delayed due to a thunderstorm Aer Lingus held our connecting flight in Dublin and an employee personally escorted us at Dublin airport to make sure we made our connection.
1063,Dublin-Berlin return. Found T2 to be a great improvement in Dublin made a great difference. Flights on time and crew on both flights friendly and a genuine interest in passengers. If you are flying Aer Lingus on an early morning flight I recommend you try their full Irish Breakfast. Aircraft clean and comfortable and was given an exit-row on the return which was great.
1064,LHR to Belfast International and they were fine and efficient. Beware of feeling forced to pay for a particular seat on their website though. They give you the impression you have no choice but to pay extra to select a seat. Just wait till online check-in opens and pick the seats you need and save Â£10s.
1065,"We booked YVR-LAX return flights as we had used Air Canada before with no problems. After reading the many bad reports, I was a bit worried. However, the A319 to LAX was boarded on time, oversized baggage sent to the hold, and room for our carry-ons above our seats. Travelled in economy, with no one in front, so had no problems with the seat comfort or pitch. In fact, the seat was more comfortable than our LH Business Class, A319, LHR-FRA. Return on a B767, again on time and oversized bags removed as full flight. Seat OK, tried the Macaroni Cheese, was hot and tasty. All in all, two pleasant flights, much better than anticipated."
1066,"AC1906, 27 May. AC1919, 7 Jun. We just had two great flight Toronto to Venice - Venice to Montreal.  Service was excellent - Cabin crew were jovial and attentive. I will tell you to buy the preferred seating upgrade - it will make the difference as the regular seats are close.  Don't forget to bring your Tablet and load the app for Apple or Android.  I was pleasantly surprised as I had only read negative reviews.  The food was plentiful and tasty on the flights."
1067,ORD-YYZ on Apr 23 on an Embraer 175 operated by Jazz and YYZ-CPH on Apr 28 on a 787-800 Dreamliner after a stopover in Toronto both legs in Business Class. ORD-YYZ was on time FA's were friendly and fairly attentive a dinner (chicken skewers on warm salad) was served nothing special but fine for the short hop. Seats were comfortable for the short flight however not as good as the first class seats on US airlines. Check-in in ORD as well as in YYZ worked well manned premium counters and just a short wait. AC uses UA lounge in ORD which was poor as expected. Fairly crowded no actual food some limited snacks most alcoholic drinks were for purchase but some were complimentary such as house wine and one type of domestic beer. However the lounge has a manned bar which for practical purposes means as this is the US tips are expected anyway. Boarding was uneventful which is good. Arrival in Pearson a mess arriving passengers are held back midway in the terminal by airport employees while crossing embarking passengers make their way to their plane. This lasted for several minutes with frustrated arriving passengers with tight connections having to wait for the embarkation process to finish. Also airport employees were rather rude in this situation. Customs hall before border control packed and 45 minutes wait to get through border control. Arrival process in Person obviously not AC's fault but still very unpleasant; not a good first impression for Canada. Check-in and security at Person was a breeze. YYZ-CPH was boarded on time but then delayed for almost an hour at the gate and on the tarmac because one generator did not work. For this reason the plane was also unpleasantly hot while on the ground. Once in the air everything was fine. The Dreamliner is obviously a modern and comfortable plane. AC?™s version has a 1-2-1 pod style configuration with lie flat seats. IFE was AVOD with a decent movie selection. Crew of friendly senior FA's were excellent professional courteous and attentive. Air Canada is obviously going for a European style of service rather than following the style of US based airlines. Also FA's were regularly present in the cabin to check if something is needed and generous with wine refills. Dinner was a seafood appetizer salad and roasted cod plus various dessert choices. I thought dinner service was very good for airline food. Also featuring some Canadian flavors as well as a Canadian Chardonnay. It always nice to be served some local tastes and not just generic airline food. Skipped breakfast in favor of sleeping an additional hour so cannot comment on its quality. AC's Maple Leaf Lounge again excellent comfortable spacious and with various quite good food options and a nice selection of drinks. A very pleasant experience and several quality steps above the lounges operated e.g. by UA or AA. Arrival in CPH was delayed 45 minutes but fine otherwise. Border Control in CPH fast and efficient and quite surprisingly for CPH no long wait for the luggage to arrive. All in all two very pleasant flights. Have not flown AC previously because of the airlines mixed reputation but wanted to make use of the stopover possibility in Toronto and to fly the Dreamliner. Will definitely include AC in my future travel plans after this experience. (Star Alliance Gold).
1068,Nearly got bumped off our flight from Toronto to NY Newark. Wasn't allowed to check in online. Arrived at the airport early and noticed our boarding cards had not issued seat numbers just asterisks. When we mentioned this we were then allocated seats with a new boarding card. The flight was overbooked and some people were subsequently bumped. We paid 25 dollars each way for luggage but loads of people who had brought large hand luggage were then made to check them in but for free. We felt this was very unfair.
1069,ZRH to TXL to MIA. First leg in Economy Class (Air Berlin does not offer Business Class on short haul). Flight on time friendly Crew and nice snack. Second flight in Business Class. Crew friendly greeted passengers by name. Seat not fully flat but angled cradle style but had a good sleep. Entertainment AVOD however no current blockbusters selection of films rather poor. Meals just okay everything is on the tray (starter cheese dessert) except the hot meal which was served seperately. Why don't they serve the cheese and the dessert not separately as they used to? Arrival in Miami a few minutes late immigration took 40 minutes Air Berlin staff in the baggage reclaim area assisting passengers.
1070,Travelled from Abu Dhabi to Phuket on 28th April. After reading the comments on here before my trip I was very apprehensive about the flight but the service was good food was good too. The only problem was the leg room which was a bit uncomfortable but I would certainly do this flight again.
1071,Travelled to Faro and returned to Belfast. Staff where great and the flight was on time with very comfortable seating. I travel back and forward to Great Britain on a regular basis and also to Europe and Canada I will try and book Air Lingus when possible.
1072,Dublin to JFK Gatwick Athens Warsaw and Krakow over the past year with Aer Lingus. Good solid service as usual despite some short delays. Aircraft are generally very clean and comfortable. Vast improvement and consistency in the entertainment system on the A330s since I last flew on one. Also had to cancel a couple of flights to Gatwick and the tax element of the fare was credited back within a couple of days. I called British Airways three times a couple of years ago for the same reason and I'm still waiting. Although AL have pitched themselves in a certain position to compete with the dreadful Ryanair their service is much more consistent than other so- called full service carriers who promise the earth but often fall short.
1073,Flew to Boston from Heathrow via Dublin and back. The service was very warm and the food delicious. Nothing was to much trouble for the crew and met all our requirements. The only drawback was the comfort of the seat. In whatever position the seat was in I just couldn't get comfortable. The other good point with flying via Dublin is clearing US Immigration and Customs prior to departure and landing into the US as a domestic passenger.
1074,DUB-JFK-DUB. Efficient check-in. Outbound flight delayed due to large numbers waiting to clear US Immigration/Customs at Dublin. On the flight the menu choice was chicken pasta or beef pasta now that you clear US customs and immigration in Dublin disembarkation at JFK was swift. The return flight left a few mins early and arrived into Dublin 45 mins ahead of time. The food was better than on the outward trip and the crew were friendly good humoured and helpful.
1075,We flew AC Rouge from Toronto to Venice and back to Toronto from Barcelona. I'd read negative reviews about Rouge but we did not have any of the problems those reviewers mentioned. Check-in was easy the flights were on time and smooth the service was basic but fine and the price was much lower than our other options. The only negatives we encountered were (1) their web site could be better organized (and web check-in did not work on the return flight) and (2) their seats were not exactly roomy (but no worse than any other carrier). I definitely would fly Air Canada Rouge again.
1076,BRU-YUL May 26th A330-300. Departed on-time landed 30 minutes late due to strong winds nice flight food excellent cabin-crew smiling and attentive except for one old lady throwing meal trays like boomerangs. Seat- pitch was very generous comfortable seat IFE a bit outdated but selection was Okay. Air Canada's problem is that the new products (Rouge and new aircraft's like 787 and 77W) are worse. I will still fly AC on long-haul.
1077,First time in 40 years to fly with Air Canada. We loved the slightly wider seats. Disappointed in no movies to watch as not all travelers have i-phones etc. Also on our trip down my husband asked twice for coffee black. He did not get any and was not offered anything else. On our trip home I asked for a black coffee. She said she was making more as several travelers had asked. I did not my coffee or anything else to drink. It was a long trip with nothing to drink especially when they had asked. When trying to get their attention they seemed to avoid my tries. We found the two female stewardess's not very friendly. It may seem a small thing but very frustrating for a traveler.
1078,DUS-MIA-DUS in economy on the A330 new seats finally with IFE. About 12 movies (some in Arabic) episodes of US sitcoms and music styles. Seats small and with legroom only for people under 1.80metre. I got row 33 next to the toilet unreclinable. Food ok. Generous dispatch of beverages (wine or beer for meals) bottle of water before the night. Friendly staff on both legs.
1079,Do not travel with Air Berlin if you are over 6 feet tall. Leg room is unheard of and it is just very unpleasant for flights of 3 or more hours. Cabin crew are helpful planes are fairly new and I would probably fly them again within Europe if prices are reasonable but never again for long haul! Food not terrible nor great either. Also keep in mind that the seats themselves are very small and luckily it was me and my wife traveling together or else it would be a very uncomfortable experience to be pasted up to a stranger. We are both very skinny people and yet we were all up in each others personal space. I took carry on bags and did not checked anything in due to hearing all the horror stories of lost baggage and I recommend you doing the same if your trip is short enough but keep in mind it needs to be under 10kg.
1080,DUB-LGW-DUB. Single class flight. Online check in easy as usual. SMS to remind me of my flight details a helpful new addition. New Terminal 2 a huge improvement on the old Dublin terminal. Security swift on the early morning rush. Gold Circle Lounge a huge improvement on the old one. Good choice of snacks and food. Flight left on time and efficient boarding with alot of connecting passengers from the US. Cabin Crew friendly and efficient. LGW easy exit but need to remember to have boarding pass ready to avoid passport control on fast domestic / ROI exit. Returning that evening long and inefficient on the queues if a lady is being searched on the opposite side of the X- ray why not call through the 8 gents waiting to go through. LGW should be excellent when finished but inefficient security a problem. Delay on flight on return but efficient boarding and flight. Again the crew were excellent. Arrival into Dublin excellent and to my car within 10 mins of getting off of the plane. Will use again.
1081,JFK-Dublin. Business Class. Return leg of previous review. Efficient boarding at JFK for what was a very full flight. Great Cabin crew who did a nice meal service that wasn't too rushed but not too lengthy either giving passengers who to get some sleep the opportunity. Good Cabin Crew presence throughout the night and they certainly kept the galley noise to a minimum which was much appreciated. Slept well for 4 hrs straight and crew served a very tasty breakfast an hour out of Dublin. Priority bags out very quickly for Dublin anyway and customs a breeze. Can't fault Aer Lingus on this flight they seem to be getting the balance just right on the LCC model. Business Class fares very competitive on this route.
1082,LHR-BFS-LHR. Arrived at check-in and found a queue that stretched all the way back to Zone A (the entire length of the check-in hall). After some time waiting I and another passenger in fear of missing the bag drop cutoff for our flight left our positions and went to in search of somebody from Aer Lingus at the check-in desks. It was then a race for our flight. Narrow claustrophobic corridors and even narrower aerobridges. EI I suppose can't be held totally responsible for the terminal area assigned them by BAA or probably even the number of counters they can open but I think they could have been a little more pro-active in providing a queue host rather than wait to be prompted by waiting pax in the queue. On the return check in at BFS was smooth no queues at -90mins and despite late arrival of the inbound aircraft we left only 5 mins late. On board both flights were unspectacular and the crew polite and efficient. Although I miss the days when EI was a full-service airline and a member of oneworld they have carried off their transition to a LC carrier successfully. Their website and all rules are simple and clear and there is no ambiguity. If you want extras you pay for them and you get them if not you don't. Simple. We wanted transportation from A to B with one bag which we made sure was under 20kg followed their rules and that's what we got. Easy.
1083,"We flew from Osaka to Vancouver on Rouge's new service. After reading all the negativity about this carrier I really did wonder if we had done the right thing. I'm happy to report that I need not have fretted I am 5'9"" and fitted into an economy seat without any problem. The service was acceptable and the cabin crew young and attentive. The dinner was ok but the portion could have been bigger! Only soft drinks offered. Breakfast was a bit of a joke. A fruit yoghurt and a breakfast sandwich. Entertainment is shown on an app downloaded to your ipad prior to take-off. The app didn't download on to my samsung tablet. Flight ran pretty much to time and the journey on this 767 was a lot more comfortable than i had expected it would be. We have several flights between USA and Canada coming up and it will be interesting to see how they stand up to the negative comments."
1084,Painless check-in. Two legs of 3 on AC: AC105 YYZ-YVR. Roomy and clean A321 with fantastic crew. AC33: YVR-SYD very light load and had 3 seats to myself. A very enthusiastic and friendly crew as usual on this transpacific route that I take several times a year. Arrived 20 min ahead of schedule. The expected high level of service from our flag carrier Air Canada. Altitude Elite member.
1085,We recently returned from Dublin to Toronto then on to Winnipeg. Other than cutting it close due to limited staffing in Toronto our flight was excellent. Due to the rush in Toronto one of our carry ones was placed to go in the cargo hold. When we arrived in Winnipeg it stayed in Toronto they were most helpful and kind at the Winnipeg airport and we received 3 phone calls the following day in regards to the misplaced bag and it was delivered to our home. We are very thankful and more than appreciative of the service we received what a great end to a wonderful holiday.
1086,Phuket to Abu Dhabi on 17th March 2013. Booked as part of a codeshare return flight with Etihad. Having read previous reviews on Air Berlin I was not looking forward to this flight sector. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how polite the cabin staff were. The plane was clean and tidy and the overall comfort was not much different to Etihad. The meal I had was typical Plane fare and a little less presentable than Etihad but edible non the less. The seat back TV did not have as much to choose from compared to say Eitihad or Emirates but fine for a 6 hour flight. Flight was on time.
1087,DUB-JFK in Business class. Very impressed with all aspects of the flight. New Gold Circle lounge in Dublin's Terminal 2 is a real improvement on the old lounges. Cabin Crew just first class very friendly and efficient and nothing was too much trouble. With US pre-clearance in Dublin I'm surprised more people aren't using Dublin as a hub for transatlantic flights as the new Terminal is a breeze to get through.
1088,DUB-TLS-DUB. Flight out was on time but return delayed by 2 hrs because of technical difficulties on an earlier leg. Both flights were very pleasant and cabin crew friendly and attentive. The problems with recent giant carry-ons seem to have abated but if you are in row 1 you will not have access to the overhead lockers because they are used for flight equipment and crew bags. A bit on the pricey side but all in all a positive experience.
1089,DUB-MAL. Flew to Malaga recently and overall very good service. Plane was an A330 so we had IFE which was good. Plane seemed new and was very clean. The only negative is that they charge ?? for a set of ear phones to use with the IFE. However any normal ones will work so it's fine. I fly Aer Lingus and have always found them safe and reliable.
1090,BRU-DUB-BRU. Flights were full on both ways and since it is a LCC service on European routes completely uneventful. They exaggerate their selling experience onboard which seems like you are in the middle of a snack- bar/shopping mall: the aisle got too busy with attendants moving about with their trollies. A bit annoying when you want to relax. However I do like the Irishness of the experience with the welcoming words in Gaelic and the green/shamrock colours everywhere. It gave me Ireland before landing in Ireland. And the flight attendants were very courteous and worked hard.
1091,May 18 2015. Barcelona to Toronto. Forced to take Rouge from Air Canada since that's what they use. Cancelled the non-stop flight on the Sunday and moved us to the Monday non-stop. Had to come on the Sunday so ended up going by way of Montreal. Was charged an additional $90 for seats with some leg room. No entertainment on a 9 hour flight. If you wanted to see something you either had your own tablet etc. or you can get an I-pad from them for $10. Food was so-so. Check in counter at Barcelona Airport was a disaster. They don't have kiosk where you can check in and print your boarding passes and luggage tags. After about an hour in line I was finally able to check in on line and proceed to the separate line to check your bags. 4th in line took 25 minutes. By the time we finally got through all the lines (Security & Immigration) we had 20 minutes to run to the gate. By the way the airport was in total disarray and major staff shortages for the thousands that were in the terminal. Everyone was being fed into 2 lines at each point. Almost had to take the Monday flight after all.
1092,Flew YEG-YYZ-YEG April 22 and May 2 return. Was using their A320 with 3-3 abreast in Economy. Flight was 99% full and most travellers already paid and selected their seats. When my turn for the 24 hour seat selection check-in comes the reservation system selected what was left for me spouse and 2 children. With it being 3-3 we got the middle and aisle of either side in row 32 BCDE. This is the last row because the ones behind us were reserved for crew only. Its gets annoying as the 2 lavatories lineups extend past your row so you get a constant flow of people going in the almost 4 hour flight. Meals for purchase are fine for those that want it. The thing that ticked me off was only beverages were served complimentary. No snacks at all on this flight. There is one FA for business class cabin while two for the economy cabin. FAs are there to do their jobs and that is it. The boarding call in YEG was good where they actually boarded the Zone 3 properly by calling out pax with children board first and enough advance notice was given. In YYZ forget that. Zone 3 was not properly announced and it jumped from announcing Zone 1 hasty Zone 2 and a hurried Zone 3 general boarding with not enough time for parents with young children to board first announced. Its seems like a mess. I had to pay for my stroller since its not the umbrella type and their small dimensions. $25 each way. Really pathetic domestic service for AC as its a flag carrier and does not seem to be like one. Seating is the older one but legroom and seat pitch seems small already. Imagine if they decide to go with their high density seating like in their new 777s. When the person in front of me reclines I almost hit my knees.
1093,GDN-TXL-TFS-TXL-GDN. In general not bad flights for quite competitive price although with some disadvantages. The main of them is Terminal C on Tegel Airport which is dedicated mainly for Air Berlin short and medium distance flights. It's overcrowded and not sufficient for big amount of departures. In result both our departures from TXL were delayed. The other disadvantage is poor in-flight entertainment. On mid-range flights it's limited to some sitcoms and one movie presented on ceiling monitors. Amount and quality of food is not sufficient for over 4 hours long flight. Fortunately we didn't experience any rudeness of cabin crew as some other reviewers did. In fact we found almost all of members of crew polite and attentive.
1094,Great flights Gatwick-Malaga-Gatwick; no hassle except Aer Lingus check-in has moved from Zone B at LGW but it wasn't reflected on my booking confirmation.
1095,Smiling and professional service punctuality comfortable seats with seat allocation  without paying extra like all low costs! I had left my ipod on the plane was recovered by staff and mailed back to me in less than a week. Thanks a lot Aer lingus.
1096,DUB-FCO MXP-DUB. Switched from Tues-Mon to avoid the stirke which never took place. No charge for the change which was nice. Both flights good usual professionalism from staff. Got back to find they had finally refunded me for a flight I didn't take because of the snow. They were not obliged to but they did which was nice. Certainly preferable to their main competitor!
1097,Aer Lingus regional (operated by Aer Arann) Birmingham to Shannon. Outward flight delayed 2 hours due to technical fault - information was very poor and we were just left waiting. ATR-72 appeared old but still presentable. Flight was smooth until the descent which was extremely bumpy. Shannon to Manchester 0700 scheduled was delayed 40 minutes due to cabin crew being delayed on the previous days flight and by law are entitled to 12 hours rest. Aircraft of high standard soft leather seats top class service overall and apologies from pilot and cabin crew for the delays.
1098,FRA to YYZ. Business class pods were wonderful. We fly these several times a year. The new Maple Leaf Lounge at FRA was beautiful! The food was fresh and plentiful power outlets were readily available spacious and the showers were excellent. The lounge is right on top of the departure gate resulting in a easy process to board the plane. Flew a 777. Pods were clean FA's were attentive and pleasant bathrooms were clean food was excellent for an airline and flight was uneventful (the way it should be). I am *A Gold. Fly AC mostly and most flights are pretty boring. Flights arrive and depart on time. Only one time in the past 12 months did my flights get cancelled or delayed. In this single case Air Canada had me rebooked quickly.
1099,Traveled YYT to MBJ for holiday. The YYT to YYZ leg was Air Canada main YYZ to MBJ was Rouge. After reading the many complaints about Rouge service I was on the lookout for problems but did not find any. Excellent service on both trips with a very attentive cabin crew. On the return leg from YYZ to YYT we were unable to land due to fog and had to return to YUL arriving at 2.30 am. Air Canada gate agents met us in the terminal with hotel and meal vouchers and informed us that a new flight for us would be departing at 9am and we received our luggage quickly. We opted to not got to the hotel as it would be a short stay so we checked back in and waited in the Maple Leaf Lounge. We reported for boarding at 8.30am but were informed that due to weather at YYT we would be delayed until 11.30am. Air Canada agents handed out meal vouchers and we returned to the lounge. Flight departed at 11.30am and we arrived YYT without incident. Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely fly Air Canada again. The delays were unavoidable as no airline controls the weather but we felt that Air Canada did everything they could to keep us informed and comfortable throughout. I should add that we were loyal Westjet customers until this year and harboured a dislike of Air Canada before this trip but we have definitely changed our opinion.
1100,Flew LHR to Toronto. Food was fairly good as was drinks service. Crew moderately friendly but not overly. Didn't look like they enjoyed their jobs. Legroom was good in economy. Boarding was good. Check in at LHR all self service and decidedly rude staff who would be better employed actually printing luggage labels etc than offering blunt and rather patronising advice to confused passengers. IFE is decidedly 'yesterday'.
1101,TXL-MIA-TXL Economy Class January 2013. Outbound flight on time however the waiting area was short of seats (old Tegel airport). After takeoff a snack was offered with soft drinks and one hour later they started to serve breakfast. Portion was ok taste ok offered drinks twice during breakfast plus coffee tea after. Mid- time offered a snack with drinks and a bottle of water. Staff were helpful and smiley. The dinner shortly before landing was good (pasta or chicken). Even served hot towels just before landing. The cabin seemed to be freshly refurbished new touch screen monitors with many movies music and games for kids. The seats were small as always on any economy transatlantic flight. Not bigger not smaller. On the inbound flight we had the same experience. I'm happy we chose Air Berlin and the price was very reasonable.
1102,ORD-DUB. Not the best international flight but cabin crew very friendly. We had an elderly passenger become very ill and they tended her with great professionalism and kindness. Planes a bit tired but the overall experience for the price was above average.
1103,LHR-BFS-LHR - first time I have flown Aer Lingus since they adopted the low cost model. The only difference between then and now is a lack of business class cabin and food and drink is not free. Still a good experience. Relatively new A320s on this route and a price comparable to EasyJet who serve BFS from LTN. Staff friendly seat pitch adequate and food and drink on sale.
1104,"I flew Toronto to Dublin return April 21 and May 8 2015. After reading negative reviews I was expecting the worst. However both flights were excellent. Both on time. I think that paying extra for Premium makes the difference-well worth it. The two-seat configuration with only 24 passengers in Premium provided plenty of room. Blanket pillow and kit bag were already on the seat when we boarded. Water and juice were offered as we sat down. Flight attendants were courteous attentive professional. Menu provided two selections for each of the two meals. Hot wash cloths before dinner newspapers iPad for movies all offered. The seats were comfortable leg room satisfactory (I am 5'4""). Pilot communicated about any expected turbulence and managed to keep it to a minimum. A very positive experience. Only negative - on return flight the check-in clerk neglected to label my bag Priority and therefore resulted in a longer wait at baggage carousel. Next time I will simply ask if the tag has been attached to the bag."
1105,LGA-YYZ-HND. I tried to reserve my seat on their online service in advance but what I saw was only their sorry page and I couldn't process any more for my seat request. When I checked-in at LGA they provided me another boarding pass for my connecting flight. I asked them to reserve a front side seat by aisle but they said they could not reserve any seats for my connecting flight at LGA. When I landed at YYZ I stopped at their counter for transferring passengers to reserve my seat but amazingly they said they couldn't do that just before the departing time. Just before my flight started boarding they changed my boarding pass and my seat was between aisle and window seats. I have asked them to give me another seat but they answered they can't do that because the flight was full. I don't know why I couldn't request my seat in advance at LGA and transfer counter at YYZ.
1106,I have just returned from a trip to Japan from Washington D.C. (DCA) to Tokyo Narita (NRT) on Air Canada flying DCA to YYZ to YVR to NRT. I returned from Tokyo Haneda (HND) via YYZ to DCA. Flight 1175 from YYZ to YVR was horrible - a 777 with 10-across cattle-car seating. Never again! Flight 3 from YVR to NRT was a great disappointment. Poor food (no taste and meagre portions) and a lacklustre cabin crew - lazy and not helpful. I had decided never to select Air Canada again (and was dreading the return flight) however Flight 6 from HND to YYZ (also a 777) had 9-across seating and a much better cabin crew. The ratings below reflect my AC006 experience AC1175 and AC003 would get poor ratings in virtually every category - even the Inflight Entertainment kept shutting off the map I was interested in watching.
1107,TXL-MIA-TXL A330-200. Very mixed box this time. After a good experience on an Air Berlin transatlantic flight lately I was looking forward to my flight to MIA. Outbound: 1 hour delay due to late arrival. Crew very reluctant and surly Purser seemed unprofessional. Meals explicitly smaller than on last transatlantic trip and not sufficient for a 10.5 hr flight. No snacks in galley some cookies handed out but only once - if you slept at this particular moment you missed your chance. Inbound: Food portions seemed larger though taste was dull. Crew very friendly. Friends of the crew (or maybe colleagues) were moved up front to C or were given nuts and chocolate bars - again: no snacks for normal Y passengers. At the beginning of the flight we experienced heavy turbulence but captain talked passengers through it. All in all both trips felt more like a vacation trip to Ibiza or the Turkish Riviera rather than a transatlantic flight of a want-to-be full service Oneworld airline.
1108,Been flying with them at least 8 times a year. Overall the planes are pretty good and the staff are usually friendly. The food is not as good as other airlines and they have been cutting down on the food: The Berlin - Tel Aviv flight would usually have a warm meal now you just get a sandwich. If that saves money fine for me because better meals can be ordered at extra cost.
1109,Chicago-Dublin-Manchester. New A330 good legroom and decent recline. Friendly check-in staff at Chicago O'Hare and cabin staff decent food. Choice in the entertainment system could have been better. Expected free alcoholic drinks on long haul flights but charged for. Baggage handled well. Dublin airport is good - shopping food space etc and immigration staff very helpful.
1110,NOC-LGW with elderly infirm passenger. Friendly service from Aer Lingus at Knock Airport. They arranged a wheelchair there and then for us (normally have to warn them 48 hours prior) and got us to the plane. After nightmare journeys with Ryanair (never again) to Ireland in the past treating their passengers like animals this was much appreciated.
1111,Gatwick to Malaga. Excellent flight no delays comfy leather seats 32 inch seat pitch in economy compared to Thomson and Easyjet and it was a cheaper fare. Cabin crew attentive. After inflight sales they advised passengers to use call button if anything was required.
1112,Boston-Shannon-Boston. Plenty of leg room entertainment screens wonderful cabin crew helpful and attentive first bag checked is free. All entertainment free and they feed you as well.
1113,"We booked a family Hawaiian vacation with our two kids aged 8 and 10 I chose the Air Canada Rouge because of the price. We chose to upgrade to premium Rouge seating for an additional fee of $400 round trip. We flew AC1831 May 6 to Honolulu - Boeing 767. Coming from Edmonton and connecting in Vancouver all flights were on time the cabin staff were vibrant and friendly. The seating while not luxurious was within means of comfort (my husband is 6 ft and I 5' 5"") and was larger than our previous flight to Hawaii with another airline in February. The aircraft was clean as were the bathrooms. There was an oversize bathroom on our aircraft which was good for parents with young kids or larger people that I had not seen on other aircraft's. The rental for ipads at $10 was a real treat for my kids - kept our kids busy the entire flight. Though we did not purchase meals on board the food that was for purchase was reasonably priced and looked nice. All of our flights arrived on time. The aircraft was a bit on the cool side however this seems to be common among all airlines. Additionally I would have preferred the cabin lights be dimmed during the entire flight at night for sleep purposes since we were flying overnight. Rouge afforded us very good value and service."
1114,YUL-FRA April 2015. A330 was in good shape. I like the arrangement of Air Canada's business class I am tall and find their lay-flat bed system to have plenty of room unlike some airlines. Staff were friendly and attentive. Food service was good.
1115,DUS-GWT on Dash8Q400. Fight was good on time and staff were friendly. The croissant was cold and not very tasty but I don't need a snack on a 50 mins ride. GWT-DUS on 737-700: old plane bad seats (seat in front of me was broken) although staff were friendly and flight was ahead of schedule. Enough for a domestic flight about 55 min.
1116,Three flights in the last 2 weeks between ZRH and BER. All flights arrived 5 to 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Seating very comfy for these flights free snack and soft drinks served. However: The biggest plus are the Flight attendants who all were extremely friendly with a lot of smiles.
1117,London Gatwick-Dublin-New York Boston-Dublin-London Gatwick. New A330 on US routes excellent entertainment onboard and good food. Very kind cabin staff. We arrived at Boston airport and our flight to Shannon was delayed for 2 hours so we could not catch the flight from Shannon to London. Aer Lingus staff rebooked our flights from Boston to London via Dublin. The US immigration clearance in Dublin instead of the USA airports were also great.
1118,BOS-SNN return. The outgoing flight was OK. I recently had a knee replacement and paid extra for roomier seats. The first set of seats were against the bulkhead and I found I had less room than if I had been in a regular seat where I could stretch my legs out. I did not get the same seats on the return and sat with my wife and daughter in the middle of the plane. I noticed that there was much more room. The food was good in both directions. Cabin staff were pleasant and attentive.
1119,Have flown return from ORK to ACE ORK to BCN and ORK to LHR in the past two months on A320. Ground service in Cork can be inconsistent. I was impressed by cabin crew and service provided with a smile. Aer Lingus provide a far superior experience than Ryanair.
1120,DUB-AMS. Breezy check-in through new T2 in DUB new plane flight on time and non-eventful.
1121,DUB-ORD-DUB. Regular traveller on this route and have noticed a steep rise in average fares in the past number of months with no enhancement of service offering. A330s used on USA routes excellent; fantastic personal entertainment systems and comfortable seating however cabin crew are still very inconsistent either helpful and polite or arrogant surly and stroppy. There seems to be no middle ground! Meals and snacks are tasty but very basic and small and there is a charge for alcoholic drinks and newspapers onboard which is very petty on a long- haul flight. Aer Lingus is a quality reliable product and a much better option for transatlantic flights than US-based carriers. The new hub at Dublin Terminal 2 is a fantastic building and represents an excellent transfer/connections facility.
1122,Traveled from YVR to HNL and back 5 hrs air time and 6 hrs gate to gate. To be fair with Rouge they are not as bad as the 1 or 2 star ratings here suggest. Yes they don't have built in entertainment system on their plane and they charge for everything such as snacks food and blankets. Services takes a long time and they are not willing to serve you even water until it's the scheduled time but I'd still give them a 5/10 for on time flights both ways and they do have average economy seats.
1123,Flew Toronto to Dublin on May 3rd. Booked emergency row 28 for extra legroom which was well worth it - however it was extremely cold in this row for the entire flight. Choice of 2 meals-chicken or pasta for dinner and banana bread and a coffee for breakfast. Rented an I pad for in flight entertainment and it was fine. Crew were OK- nothing sensational or terrible. Offering duty free 25 minutes before landing was somewhat late. Flight smooth and on-time but it is an older 767 and I would no fly Rouge unless I had the extra legroom I paid for ($90.) Baggage 2 days late however this was not Rouge's fault but Air Canada mainline connections from Halifax to Ottawa to Toronto before the flight to Dublin.
1124,LHR-YUL April 2015. A330 was in good shape. Very comfortable seat/lie-flat bed. Not a super long flight and they offer 2 meal services I couldn't do the second as I wasn't hungry. Staff were friendly and attentive. Flight arrived 45 minutes early nice bonus. Lounge in LHR is nice connected from Copenhagen and had to change terminals I thought I was walking to Canada pretty long hike.
1125,Flew YDF-YYZ-PVG in Economy. Although I usually check-in online I did so at the airport since it is a small airport and I had luggage to check through to Shanghai. Staff were friendly and efficient. The first flight was an A319 from Deer Lake NL to Toronto which was comfortable and had a great selection on the AVOD. There was food for purchase and complimentary drinks. For the Toronto-Shanghai flight boarding was relatively efficient despite being a full flight. Take off was on time and the same AVOD was available. Seats although small were comfortable. Beverage service began 45 minutes after take off accompanied by a small bag of pretzels. Supper was served approximately 1.5 hours after take off which consisted of either a pork or chicken option. I had the chicken in cream sauce with roasted potato carrot and green bean. Also each tray had a corn and iceberg lettuce salad a white bun and brownie for dessert. It was quite decent for airline food and certainly not the worst I've had travelling. The wine selection was decent too. At the halfway point a Nissin cup of noodles were served with a chicken finger sandwich on white bread with a pack of biscuits. Finally there for breakfast there was a choice between congee or eggs and sausage. I elected for the mushroom and chicken congee which was quite good. It was accompanied by melon and a white bun with jam and butter. Overall it was a good experience and the flight arrived smoothly and promptly in China
1126,AC881 CDG to YYZ. Clean and well maintained 777. On-time pushback from gate takeoff slightly delayed. Pleasant cabin crew led by attentive Cabin Service Director who was working my section of the J cabin. Food choices good meal service well timed. Wide variety of entertainment choices. Landed within 5 minutes of scheduled time and baggage delivered to carousel in record time for YYZ. Great flight.
1127,DÃ¼sseldorf to Fort Myers return 3 weeks later. The food was good no complaints. Flight service staff were very good - ground service staff not so. The in-flight entertainment was very good. There was a problem with one monitor. The problem had not been fixed on the return flight - we had the same seats on the same machine! My problem is with the reclining seats. They are very peculiar in that in the full sleep position the body is in a decline the legs and feet are lower than the upper body. A very odd position that I found most uncomfortable. The seats looked a bit worn for newly installed seating. Late night check-in in DÃ¼sseldorf left something to be desired. There were 4 counters open and just a handful of passengers checking in. The Business counter was dealing with a rather lengthy problem so we went to one of the economy counters. The woman at this counter practically snarled at us. For these reasons - poor service by the ground staff and the office staff I would hesitate to fly with Air Berlin again.
1128,DUB-FCO and LIN-DUB. LIN-DUB delayed by inconsiderate passengers bringing huge bags on board as carry on luggage and by ineptitude of LINstaff. Aer Lingus needs to get a grip of this. Delayed half an hour as people could not seat themselves as people tried to cram bags that would not fit into overhead cabins.
1129,DUB-BHX-DUB. Early morning flight to Birmingham using the new T2 fantastic building and a great service from EI ground crew. Outbound crew good but not anywhere near the Aer Lingus standard. Onboard service was standard on UK bound services. Return flight that night a disgrace. Cabin crew varied some friendly some not so friendly. They were however all extremely unprofessional messed about with the announcements joked with each other during the safety demonstration and during the inflight service.
1130,JFK-DUB-LGW return. A comfortable seat with adequate legroom appreciated being able to buy an exit row seat for the night flight attentive but professional cabin crew food simple but tasty. Dublin a very compact and easy transfer airport looking forward to the completion of move to the new T2.
1131,London Gatwick - Malaga return in economy class. Online booking was simple enough with extras available (seat selection extra baggage lounge access etc) at a reasonable cost after the booking was confirmed. My comments below refer to both the outbound and inbound flights unless otherwise mentioned. Check-in was quick and efficient with friendly staff. Oddly though check-in at Malaga opened just one and a half hours before departure despite their website suggesting that you arrive two and a half hours before. Boarding was pain free and organised with special needs passengers quietly loaded first with assigned seating there was no scrum. Cabin was clean and tidy on an A320 with standard seating and adequate leg room. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive and the in-flight service was relaxed and well performed. A good selection of food and drink was served at an unusually reasonable cost. My bacon baguette was so good I asked for another! Arrived early (by fifteen minutes in Malaga and thirty minutes in London) and was off the plane promptly. I can't comment on baggage arrival times as I had hand baggage only.
1132,"Flew Toronto to Tampa return flight. Friendly service with attendants coming through cabin to offer refreshments (only took free beverage as I had my own snacks) and pick up garbage. Cabin temperature comfortable and seats firm but tolerable. No issue with leg room as I am only 5 ft 3 in but little room to move. Both flights left on time and arrived a bit early. Cabin was very clean and best of all we arrived safely! I was very sceptical about Rouge because of past reviews but for a very quick flight to Florida (just under three hours) - great value. Gave entertainment a ""1"" because I didn't use it and there is no option on this survey for ""not applicable""."
1133,FRA-TXL-AUH-HKT-AUH-TXL-FRA. Surprisingly good experience compared to European competitors. FRA-TXL and TXL-FRA flights excellent - complimentary food and wine on a 50 mins domestic flight. TXL-AUH (22.11.12) - enough legroom on A330 personal display and professional friendly and smiling crew. Cabin was in perfect condition. Food was tasty with choice of pasta or beef and drink runs about 4-5 times. Same experience on flight AUH-TXL (07.12.12) with meal and snack on a 6.5 hr flight wide choice of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks too. Unfortunately moving map was out of order. The captain kept us informed instead. However experience on both flights AUH-HKT (26.11.12) and HKT-AUH (06.12.12) was not really the same as mentioned above. Flight crews looked a bit nervous and tired only 1 drink run. What I dislike at AB is that although they have a very good IFE system it gets boring watching the same movies and listening to same music on each and every flight with them. Especially if you have 4 long hauls in 2 weeks. Either update it monthly or by leg! The second complain is TXL as a transfer airport-it looks appalling and awful in every sense. All in all above average experience. Would fly them again.
1134,Gatwick- Knock flight very good. Coming home on 17th December after sitting on the plane for two hours the flight was cancelled due to cabin crew working to long because of the heavy snow and the delays. Aer Lingus were fantastic and put us up for two nights in a wonderful Hotel.
1135,New York to Amsterdam and back with Aer Lingus and had a great experience. Our flight was a little delayed on the way back from Amsterdam and we were afraid we'd miss our connection in Dublin. But Aer Lingus had someone waiting for us and the gate who escorted us through express security and right to the plane. Staff very friendly and helpful.
1136,LHR-DUB. Excellent flight. Very pleasant staff (becoming a rarity) In all excellent value for money. Reports that they are thinking about going back up market so long as they keep their pricing sane I'll be happy.
1137,We flew with Air Canada Rouge April 24th and May 1st 2015. We travelled from Toronto to Curacao (return trip). Both flights were excellent and smooth. Best landing I have ever experienced! Flight crew were very professional and helpful to all peoples' needs. I strongly recommend and will fly with this airline again.
1138,I live in Cleveland and fly to Paris twice a year. I fly Air Canada through Toronto. Yesterday my flight from Paris was delayed by an hour making my chance of making connecting flight to Cleveland very slim. I went to the Air Canada desk to try and get a seat on a later flight and the customer service agent helped me make the earlier flight by walking me to the front of the customs line the (to me unnecessary) security line and then the immigration line. Without her I would have had to wait an additional 2 hours.
1139,I flew AMS-LHR-YOW on April 2nd and return on April 12th. Both were BA/AC interline flights. The BA flights and the transits at London Heathrow from T5 to T2 and vice versa proceeded very smoothly. Now my comments on my experience with Air Canada on this trip: Air Canada uses the Boeing 767-300ER between YOW and LHR. Despite this plane showing its age it's always a very sturdy and reliable plane no wonder that many airlines are still using them regularly on long haul routes. On my outbound flight the captain gave accurate cockpit announcements and staff members on both flights were very attentive and professional. Food snacks and refreshments were plentifully provided throughout the flights. My only issue is with the seats which were uncomfortable and there was very little legroom. Otherwise the meals were decent by airplane food standards and Air Canada offers a great inflight entertainment service keeping you busy on a 7-hour flight. I travel to Canada at least a couple of times a year and previously I used KLM travelling to Ottawa with a stopover at YUL. The route I took with Air Canada this time works out better for me personally and overall I am quite well satisfied with this airline. Will use them again in the future.
1140,I have to say that Air Canada is the only Continental North American airline offering Premium Economy for some long haul flights and is very competitive with some Asian airlines that offer this cabin and I have to thank to AC for this. Despite the amazing good service and private cabin the comfort is something that is not quite the best. The front seat row 12 on the Dreamliner 787-8 is missing the leg support and relax as all other Asia/Pacific airlines such CX NH JL QF BR which has superior seat comfort and welcoming Champagne as well not only water and juice as AC offers. The food is very good and the drinks are well served 10 min once we are airborne. Flight Crew is very friendly and keep someone at the 'food bar' ready to help you with a drink or snack such as cookies during the entire flight. My flights were YVR-PEK on March 24 returning on Apr 2. Thank you Air Canada for stepping over your all other North American Airlines with this service without removing the good service on regular economy.
1141,"TXL-JFK and JFK-DUS-TXL. All in all better experience than I thought. A330 long haul product quite good. Boarding very strict and by rows. Standard Y seats comfort is good and legroom is okay (if you are 5'10""). XL seats (exit row) on return trip very spacious for a little up-sell. Pleasant surprise: IFE - lots of choices and large screens for Y class. Amenity kit offered on overnight return flight. Food outbound was quite a good surprise as well. Return was so so but still portions are generous. Drinks runs are not so frequent but you can go to the galleys. Cabin attendants are a mixed box but in general friendly. Domestic product: 737-700 looked a bit tatty and old quite cramped."
1142,Woke up at 4 am to a crying 21 yr old study abroad daughter who had a flight cancelled from Rome to Dublin - Aer Lingus desk information personnel did not notify my daughter that they would rebook her trip for the next day - she in turn spent an additional $1100.00 to try to get home. She is currently in a hotel (still in Rome) and was told there would be no other compensation. She'll be flying back Alitalia.
1143,JFK-DUB A330 Economy. Good service everything working properly average food polite attentive crew. I'd suggest to choose seats before flight to get a comfortable place. In general a good average service - nothing special nothing bad.
1144,Have flown the Toronto - Dublin route a few times now overall it wasn't a bad experience food was decent (included) free non alcoholic drinks offered continuously the staff very good washrooms maintained seat room as good as most and entertainment provided via your own iPad (download app ahead of time) quite good and changed regularly and there is power every other seat to share. Cons: There is no personal air flow so cabin can get quite hot but the staff are pretty good at turning down the temp once you say something. The inflight entertainment does not have any info connected to the flight progress. Have to use credit card to pay for anything on the flight like alcohol iPad rental or duty free.
1145,Recently flew with Air Canada Rouge from Vancouver to Honolulu and Maui to Vancouver. After reading all the bad reviews I was really apprehensive about flying with them. However there is nothing to complain about the staff on both flights was attentive and courteous drinks were served twice during the flights in between the flight attendants came round with water. There is little legroom and the seats are not the most comfortable ones but the plane was clean as were the bathrooms. I cannot comment on the food or the entertainment program since I brought my own. People around me seemed happy with the food they had purchased on the plane. I would definitely fly Air Canada Rouge again.
1146,AC63 - YVR to ICN. Flight was delayed because of malfunctioning A/C. Plane had left the gate and had to return. The total delay was over 2 hrs because of strong headwinds. The plane was immaculate as it was one of Air Canada's new B787-800s. The service was good but there was no 2nd option for meals on that flight-we were all served the same meal. Air Canada's new inflight entertainment system is incredibly responsive and has a great user interface. It is by far the best system I've experienced on a plane. It kept me occupied for the entire flight. The armrest controls on the other hand could have used some additional thought as it was placed on the surface of the armrest rather than the side and resulted in frequent accidental presses. Many people pressed the attendant call button or the overhead light unintentionally by resting their elbows on the buttons.
1147,YYZ-PEK - March 20 - April 11 - The staff who work for Air Canada must be really unhappy in their jobs - no smiles here. The food on board could be greatly improved. On the return trip we noticed that the dining trays in our row were dirty and had not been cleaned from previous passengers. The toilet was also unclean and that was at the beginning of the flight.
1148,Flew from Los Angeles to Berlin and my only complaint is that the passenger behind me asked me not to put my seat back as she then would have no room. I obliged because the passenger in front of me also did not use his seat recline so that I could have a little room. Flight staff very hard working and I remarked to the purser that they did a very good job. The food was adequate plane was clean and fairly new and we arrived to our destination on time. I would fly Air Berlin again.
1149,DUB-JFK return A330 economy. On time comfy enough nice 3 course meal movie snack and small breakfast before landing. AVOD really good and nice selection of movies. All cabin crew friendly efficient and helpful. Pre-immigration clearance at Dublin Airport was fast and save a lot of queuing in NY. Take advantage from seat selection before you fly so you can get best seats available.
1150,ORK-MUC and BCN-ORK Excellent value for money with Aer Lingus. Both flights on-time service friendly and helpful aircraft clean and a good variety of buy onboard options. What I like about Aer Lingus is the fact that the staff aren't constantly trying to sell to you during the flight. It makes the flight a lot more enjoyable and comfortable. Pre-assigned seating also helps to avoid the boarding scrum.
1151,YUL-YYZ-HKG-YYZ-YUL A320/B777. Typical of AC flights were late or delayed despite the weather being ok. Outbound YYZ-HKG flight had obnoxious disappearing FAs combined with a malfunctioning IFE. F&B was nothing special but edible. An average flight. Return HKG-YYZ-YUL flights were distinguished by the worst departure and arrival delays of all the flights and terrible catering. The J class main meal of beef was overcooked and inedible as it was so tough. Breakfast highlight was dried out croissants and a glop of salty greasy noodles. FAs on this segment were professional efficient and polite. AC's IFE featuring small screens with poor resolution has a limited library of interesting titles. It remained closed for most of my flights unlike my flights on CX or BR which offer current films along with an interesting selection of Asian films. AC's international films have a lot of Bollywood and are of little interest to China/Japan route customers. I really look forward to the Asian film selection on AC's higher end competitor EVA. The AC IFE equipment is at least 5 years out of date along with the uncomfortable worn out pods. The equipment was somewhat cleaner than usual although AC still refuses to provide headrest covers like the Asian airlines do. Not the most hygienic approach to air travel. The new blankets are a welcome change. The lavs were the usual basic AC setup so very different than those found on Asian carriers. Boarding procedures have drastically improved with the implementation of zones although many pax still do not understand the cabin baggage size and weight limits. AC has an inconsistent approach to this issue and I could see that some economy cabin pax were going to be made uncomfortable by a few selfish people. Desk agents on all segments were polite and pleasant to deal with. Baggage delivery at Canadian airports was slow as usual. Considering the fare paid which was higher than the AC competitors I don't think I received good value for my purchase. AC offers an expensive inconsistent product with unreliable on time performance.
1152,AC 016 31st March from HKG to Toronto. A very pleasant surprise. The service was outstanding and the attention to details also surprisingly good. I was impressed by the attention to service and the passengers exhibited by the staff and overall Air Canada has certainly improved their intercontinental Business Class product. The seats were very comfortable and this is the first time I have flown the Hong Kong to Toronto route on Air Canada. I usually fly Cathay Pacific or EVA and dollar for dollar Air Canada comes out on top.
1153,My wife and I flew (non-stop) San Francisco to Dusseldorf AB7393 Sept 5 2012. Everything from check-in to landing could not have been better! Everyone on the ground and in the air was friendly all smiles food and movies great leg room was good. The trip back on Sep 19 AB7392 was the same. I have flown in to Dusseldorf 2 other time on other airlines and Air Berlin will have my business from now on.
1154,LHR-BFS. First time on Aer Lingus and I'd be happy to book again. Strikes delayed the aircraft's departure by 90 minutes - I was impressed that self service check-in kiosk itself adjusted the boarding time to reflect this two hours beforehand. Onboard the plane was clean comfortable and I'd picked a fair seat online a few hours before. Cabin Crews clearly more established than Ryanair and ovrall I was impressed with their courtesy and handling of the delays though amused by one lady's charming attempts to sell additional items when people ordered drinks and snacks. Ticket price from Heathrow of Â£35 is superb value.
1155,LGW-ORK return. Good service from cabin crew a little late out of LGW but made up time on route. Good seats and value for money.
1156,BFS-LHR Flight boarded promptly and took off 15 mins early. Smooth flight to LHR crew very good and landed 20 mins early in Heathrow. Usual good service from Aer Lingus however connecting to a BA flight in First to the US and they had no priority luggage tags at Belfast to put onto our bags.
1157,Belfast Intl to Barcelona and Malaga. Good all round service. Flights on time and efficient. The best point for me was the price. These flights were a better price than budget carriers were charging.
1158,This was our first time flying with Air Canada Rouge (from Vancouver to Maui and return). We had read the reviews of Air Canada Rouge and they were so horrible that we were really apprehensive about flying with them. However we did not experience many of the bad things other people seem to have experienced. One of us has a mobility disability and we had excellent service from the staff in the airport who met us with a cart and took us through from one end to the other. The plane was a half hour late leaving Vancouver as we were waiting for some passengers coming from a connecting flight that was late. Our take off on the way home was however right on time. The plane was clean. The staff were young but they were friendly and attentive on both flights. The food wasn't great but it was adequate. We rented an ipad and watched a movie on the flight to Maui the entertainment was adequate. We only had two complaints: Firstly the communication over the intercom was poor quality and the information was relayed so quickly we could not understand a word they were saying. Secondly the seats were extremely uncomfortable. There was virtually no space between our knees and the seats in front of us. Our seats were also very narrow. This total lack of legroom makes for an uncomfortable flight especially on an all-night flight when you are trying to sleep. We would recommend Air Canada Rouge to others as it is more affordable but we would qualify our recommendation with the above pros and cons.
1159,YYZ-YVR-SYD on AC34. Short line with quick and efficient service at the Business class check in at Toronto Pearson Airport. Complimentary meal on the domestic leg as I was continuing onwards to Sydney. Decent portion size and more than edible economy class full meals on the international leg. On time the entire way. Fantastic service onboard. Definitely recommend.
1160,JFK-Berlin-Stockholm. The JFK-Berlin leg was in Business and the Berlin-Stockholm in Economy with no other option. I found the initial flight to be very good helped by a highly professional cabin crew plenty of room and good facilities even though the plane was older. The food and beverage were very good and generally this rates as high up on my scale of satisfaction. The seats are to be upgraded soon but were not bad if not entirely flat in bed mode. Berlin's newish Tegel Airport was something of an experience. The flight parked on the tarmac and in pouring rain once we were off the plane a people mover took us to the terminal for immigration and customs. Thankfully the process was fast and efficient although I had to race in order to ensure getting to the next gate for the flight to Stockholm. The next flight was however delayed without any explanation and ultimately proved to be less memorable. The plane was older and again required a walk in rain to board. Berlin Tegel is therefore an airport to be avoided in future. To Stockholm there was a limited service although staff had been trained well. I will watch and use them again.
1161,JFK-DUB-EDI GLA-DUB-JFK. Business class from JFK with a stopover in Dublin and very pleased with the experience. I felt obligated to submit a review since our experience was so positive. Business class seating was very nice as we had the newer aircraft both ways. Seats are angled lie-flat but compared favorably to LH?™s Business seats. Fairly decent selection of movies and TV shows although the audio selections weren?™t wonderful. Flight Attendants in both directions were very attentive. The food was surprisingly good. We were on the late flight out of JFK so there was supposed to be a light meal service with full breakfast in the morning. We started with tasty canapÃ©s followed by an optional cold chicken plate ??optional because some people chose to sleep right away. The only disappointment was breakfast as the eggs were overcooked. Dinner on the way back was very good with smoked salmon to start and good beef as a main. Both business class check-ins were very quick and pleasant. The lounge at JFK was very nice and food was actually very good. The only downside was that it was outside of security so we had to make sure to allow enough time after relaxing in the lounge. The lounge at Dublin was very nice although with limited food. We had to deal with two economy class check-ins and flights DUB-EDI and GLA-DUB and both were painless. The agent at GLA checked our bags all the way through to JFK even though the two legs had been booked separately. One bag did not make it to JFK but it was located and delivered the next day. All in all it was a great deal for good business class service. We would definitely do it again on the same routes although we probably wouldn?™t want to be in a full economy class plane going from DUB to Athens or Rome.
1162,BHX-Dublin-Orlando return. Quick check-in at BHX short flight to Dublin. Pleasant airport waiting for connection. Flight to Orlando food quality and quantity very good as was the seat-back inflight entertainment - our 2 children were kept very happy! Return the same food not as good but still acceptable and flights on-time. The cabin crew on all flights were very friendly and helpful. Only downside our cases weren't transferred at Dublin and followed on the next flight and delivered to our home the next day - according to staff at BHX this happens regularly with transfers. Not impressed with airport security at Dublin - wife bought a bottle of water at Orlando departure lounge and a very rude and self-important security woman grabbed it out of her hand and threw it in a bin when we arrived. But then within 10 feet of security you can buy another over-priced bottle - what's that all about? She missed the 2 cups of airline water in our hand luggage though!
1163,LHR-SNN return. Good flights and service. Fairly no-frills but you don't need that much on a short flight. At least you have an assigned seat. Would always use Aer Lingus in preference to Ryanair.
1164,Toronto to Ft Lauderdale via Montreal / return trip. Exorbitant price for an advance ticket only to find I was on standby for all 4 legs of the trip. Ticketing in Ft Lauderdale was atrocious! Kiosks didn't function properly lines were chaotic only 2 ticket agents available during spring break week and they were slow as can be. They stuck the baggage tags on the wrong tickets. Even the agent at the gate was fed up. I am submitting this review with her encouragement!
1165,PBI-YYZ-YOW on the Tuesday after March break. Both flights on time first on an A321 and the second on an embraer e-190. Both aircraft clean with an excellent choice of IFE for regional flights. The crews were professional if a little aloof; seat comfort and legroom was as good as it gets in economy. Air Canada is a solid airline and (at least regionally) does not deserve their bad reputation.
1166,FRA-TXL. Non-Stop on an Airbus 320-200. Check in line and security was fast and efficient. Gate was a short walking distance from security. After waiting at the gate for half an hour we were let into departures lounge. The lounge provided complementary magazines to all passengers. Since I do not speak or read German I was unable to read them. When boarding was finally announced everyone rushed to get onto the plane. After our boarding pass was checked we board a bus and were taken to the plane. Since the plane was about Â¾ full everyone had a lot of space. Staff were great and helpful. Most spoke German English and a third language. Once in the air flight attendants provided us with a complementary non-alcoholic drink and snack. Landing was great and we arrived early in Berlin. As we were getting off the aircraft everyone was given a thank you chocolate. We again had to board a bus which was a short drive to the terminal. It did not take long for my bag to show up on the arrivals belt and for my vacation to begin. For the price I paid for the flight with taxes $108 CND/??7 they are a great deal. TXL is a dump so it will be nice when Brandenburg opens up.
1167,"Berlin - Los Angeles. I loved the non-stop service and the nice flight attendants but the food was sub-par and the ""new"" business class seats which will be replaced again in November to bring AB on the same level as Etihad were not comfortable. The also ""new"" VOD with bigger screens did not work for me either. All in all flying Air Berlin business class is still worse than Air New Zealand or Turkish Airlines Premium Economy which is a shame for the rather high business class fare they charge!"
1168,JFK to Zurich with a stop in Germany. Flights both ways between JFK and Germany were on Airbus A330. Complimentary mints and newspapers offered during boarding. The seats were cloth and had adjustable head rests. Leg room felt above average for Economy. Each seat had a pillow blanket and small amenity kit. Personal seatback TV's were also available at each seat and headphones were offered. TV's were touch screen and had a great selection. Flight Attendants offered a substantial food service 2 meals with entree' and side offerings and multiple beverage services. Flights between Germany and Switzerland were onboard Airbus A319 aircraft. These planes had leather Economy seats but without an adjustable headrest. No seatback TV but there were TV screens hanging over the seats every few rows. A few music channels were also available with the volume controls in the armrest. They offered a light snack and beverage service on these flights. The only/main complaint I have is that on every flight flight attendants were some of the rudest people I have seen!
1169,Just finished my flight from EZE to YQB with Air Canada's two cabin 777. It was a wonderful flight. After the stop in Santiago the fresh crew took care of all details. Although SCL is not the best kitchen in AC's network the food was good. The service was efficient but not rushed. It allowed for the cabin to go in sleep mode fairly early on in the flight. I don't understand AC's decision to move away from the two class config pods. They are comfortable and for me 6'1 a welcome lie flat experience. Slept very well and woke up just in time for breakfast. Hats off for this 5 star crew! Seems to me AC is working hard on maintaining and potentially increasing their service standards.
1170,Just flew from Seoul to Vancouver and then onwards to Los Angeles less than 24 hours ago. Flight was fine except that I'm not too sure if the four star rating is justified - I'd say its more like 3.5. Tried the 787 for the first time and I have to say that the lighting system is brilliant as it eases the level of brightness on the eyes whenever the light is turned on by going from dark to bright gradually. Another added bonus to flying with Air Canada is that it makes US entry easy since customs and immigration is cleared in Canada thus not having to deal with the debacle that is met at US airports. As for the in flight experience the food wasn't half bad but the seating and entertainment can see some improvements. The seats were not ergonomically designed and no matter what position I would turn my body I just couldn't manage to sleep due to the discomfort and entertainment although extensive did not have a decent selection of films to choose from.
1171,JFK-TXL-BRI Check in at JFK was fast and easy staff on board excellent. My seat was 14A which is in the first row. Found pillow and blanket on my seat but was told I had to stow it up top until after take off. Didn't think I would see them again but 15 min into the flight it was handed back to me without having to ask! Dinner and snacks were served with a smile. TXL to BRI was much of the same. Will absolutely fly again.
1172,We requested a ticket from Venice to Cologne/Bonn on May 21st and we were issued a flight AB8991 to Tegel Berlin with a 40 minutes stopover then flight AB6503 to Cologne/Bonn. Just as well we arrived at Venice airport early as four Air Berlin flights were leaving and only five counters were open. After 45 minutes they opened three more counters which meant we were checked in for our flight 1 hour 10 minutes after lining up. Given baggage receipts and boarding pass's to Cologne/Bonn. Flight was very good in all aspects other than we arrived Tegel at terminal C and were bussed to terminal C which was a delay. We then ran 800 meters to terminal A arriving at gate A6 at 16.45 hours. We were informed that our flight had left early also told we were not on their computer and nor was our baggage on this flight so they were not expecting us. They could not explain why we had onward boarding pass's issued in Venice. We went to their ticket office in terminal A and had superb service to ensure we caught the next flight to Cologne/Bonn. On arrival in Cologne our bags awaited us at the lost luggage area as they had come through on flight AB6503. A pity as in the air it is a good airline but ground staff wise it is way behind.
1173,Flew AC Rogue from Toronto to HNL round trip first of April 2015. The flight was as good as any I have been on in the US (we are from the US) and otherwise. The seats were fine the food for purchase good the crew attentive and the service overall good to great. Infight entertainment worked just fine and btw there were pillows and blankets on every seat. Bathrooms fully operational and clean. I will fly Rogue anytime. The service is good and should take advantage of the prices. The price alone beat any of my US options by 300.00 pp.
1174,Took my first 787 flight on Feb 27 from Beijing to Vancouver. Thoroughly enjoyable with great service. I prefer the new pods to the old type. Will be doing the same flight soon in Premium Economy which looks very inviting and I did try out the PE seats. I also checked the economy cabin and I am not about to experience it. On their downward spiral on customer comfort this is a high density cabin to be avoided. I am supportive of open skies as until there is some real competition in Canada on product and prices both AC and Westjet (which I no longer fly) will keep squeezing the passenger on everything.
1175,"Surprisingly decent flights from YWG-YYC-OGG. Flights on time from YWG delayed slightly from YYC-OGG. Air Canada 767-300er (non rouge) is a solid air craft. Surprised however that the crew did not offer a free meal on a 7 hour international flight. Passengers we're restless about that. Decent pitch for a guy who is 6""4 such as myself. The better of the two AVOD systems in Canada for sure. Only gripe was an extended period of ""turbulence"" where there was no communication many passengers stood up to use the facilities as did I. About 3-4 hours into the flight. The senior flight attendant rudely remarked ""you know the seatbelt sign is on!"" Not exactly highly service oriented. But still worth the trip from Calgary. This route for sure will be a rouge flight soon in which case avoid like the plague. But for standard AC mainline about as expected nothing wrong but a few things missing. Far superior to United service to Maui for example through Denver."
1176,Last Sunday travelling as a legit full fare paying J class pax from LAX-YYZ-YWG. AC792 arrives late from LAX into YYZ but still there is an hour to connect to AC271 YYZ-YWG. Canada Customs press a magic button which allow my 2 checked bags to go directly to my connecting flight when I announce I am returning from a vacation in Hawaii. I proceed to my domestic gate to board AC271 and while in line am redirected by the gate agent to see her colleague at the gate desk. I am told I have been taken off the flight as my 2 checked bags won't make the flight? I am offered a Y class seat on the last flight of the night with a suggestion by the gate agent that the stars may align and I may get to ride in the cabin I paid for. Sent unceremoniously to the Maple Leaf lounge to await my fate I am granted access to the exclusive club even though I have now been stripped of my upper class status. Within an hour I am presented with a J class boarding pass for the last flight of the night to YWG. Was I bamboozled by my favourite mother country flag carrier giving away my original highly prized seat 1A on a Jungle jet back to Winnipeg on AC271? My 2 checked bags went through YYZ without me even seeing them and they were secured for travel from LAX-YYZ-YWG on company aircraft yet I was denied boarding AC271 based on the fact that my bags would not make the flight? Was I being punished for flying Delta from HNL-LAX in order to avoid flying Rouge? Or was my seat given away prematurely to a company commuter? Even when you pay full fare J class you have to role with the punches.
1177,Ground service and check in process very friendly and no queue. Lounge share with British Airways in Berlin Tegel very quiet. Lots of drinks and snacks. No extra boarding queue for Biz but the boarding process was quick. Took off on time. Very satisfied with the service. Friendly and attentive. Food was delicious from the famous Sansibar Kitchen of Sylt. New Business Class seats. Lie angle seat. Not comfortable to sleep. Nice massage function for relax. IFE good with new high pix display. The film and music selective was big enough. Only 4 biz pax this flight. Touch down on time. Price was fair. Overall would choose AB biz again.
1178,Again a very nice experience flying Air Berlin this time from DÃ¼sseldorf to Copenhagen. Easy check-in flight was on time cabin was nice flight attendant was friendly and everything seemed very relaxed. You even get a drink and a little snack for free on such a short flight. Flew them 3x before on similar routes and every time it was a very agreeable way to fly with not a single trace of a problem.
1179,We flew on Air Canada Rouge last month from Toronto to Phoenix return. While this was our first experience with Rouge having had tremendous negative feedback about the very limited leg room my husband and I decided to upgrade to preferred seating before we left on our trip. The preferred seating was better than the regular seating for sure. However while we paid $160 extra to upgrade our seats our boarding zone did not change. This meant that we boarded the aircraft last because our reservation was booked using points. When we actually did board the aircraft the overhead bins near our row were all full. It seems reasonable to me that when a person upgrades to preferred seating at an additional cost they should board right after business class passengers and before regular seating. Until Air Canada discontinues the practice of having passengers pay for their one checked bag onboard storage space will continue to be a huge problem. When I paid extra to have preferred seating I would have expected preferred service!
1180,AC1825 27/28 Mar Las Vegas - Toronto. Very professional. For a low cost airline the service was out standing I was seated in the front cabin and the flight attendants where as good as I've had on any airline and better than most. They had enthusiasm.
1181,Everything ran smoothly. Great price good food and service flawless connection. We flew JFK to Verona Italy. We had a quick stop in Dusseldorf. Would fly again in a heartbeat.
1182,JFK-DUS-STR Both flights were full. Flight attendants were friendly professional and spoke English and German. Meal choices were fine but not very tasty. My main gripe with the trip was the leg room. I had more leg room on my trip from to STR then I had to DUS. The matter wasn't helped in the fact that the seat in front of me was reclined for the entire trip making it next to impossible for me to reach the carry-on I had put under the seat in front of me. The best part of the trip was the IFE. Probably the best I've experienced in the last year.
1183,Flew YYZ to HNL round trip from on the 11th and 24th May. Came in with full expectations of the plane being a cramped mess with no power at the seats iron bars sticking in my back and basically no service. What we experienced was pretty much the opposite. Typical flight knew about the entertainment so came prepared had lots of food power at the seats decent service no bar in the back. We upgraded to the extra leg room (premium?) seats and I know that made a difference for me. Ultimately the trip to and from HNL was a total non-event just as it should have been. Based on the expectations we had coming in they were wildly exceeded. Maybe we got lucky with a refurbished plane but if this is the norm for AC Rouge then the norm is just fine. They should still be discounted more if they are going to call themselves a discount carrier though. I won't hold my breath for that.
1184,ORD-YUL-CDG in economy on 25/26th Jan 15. Our first flight with Air Canada was a shuttle from Chicago to Montreal where our flight to Paris CDG was our next leg. In fact due to late arrival we missed our connection and had to stay 24 hours in Montreal. Everything was handled perfectly by AC staff who gave us vouchers for a 4* hotel nearby and for meals. We could get our checked luggage back and were immediately handed our boarding pass for the following day. All being very smooth in a quiet airport. The following day our 6 hours flight to Paris by itself was OK with various standards. Aircraft (777-300) with a clean cabin without decoration the blue colour of seats being the only colour. The seats were standard without footrests. A good VOD system with recent movies especially for French speaking passengers. This is for the good side but when you see the fancy earphones handed over you will regret not to have yours with you. The weak side starts with no newspapers or magazines available. Cabin crew obviously well trained and working efficiently. I am sorry that uniforms are so plain. No efforts from attendants to look like attendants and participate to the dream of flying like many other airlines. Meals were frankly just edible. A small salad where I am still looking for dressing chicken with bulgur (totally bland) and a so-called chocolate cake retaining from chocolate only the colour! A standard rate for the table wine offered graciously and for the rolls quite correct for an airline. A bad rate for the low quality plastic cutlery. It seems North American carriers do like plastic very much. Before landing we had a slice of cake (good) with hot drinks served in a tumbler. All in all we were expecting more from an Airline claiming to be for the 5th time the best airline in North America. It is true that US competitors are so bad but European airlines are much better and Emirates/Asian carriers are on another planet where passengers are taken care of.
1185,YVR-YUL-YVR Flights on time FA's were all very nice and friendly. They offered us water maybe 4-5 times during the flight. Nothing bad to say about them.
1186,My wife and I flew the Toronto-Cancun route 3 times this season. (AC10-11) and were pleasantly surprised. When Rouge began operating this service I wrote a very negative review. I believe they have listened and are trying. My biggest complaint from the beginning was the insane seating discomfort. The new plane flying this route is a 767 and it is quiet clean maintained very well and the seating is very comfortable. The crew do their best and I have no problems with them whatsoever. Sometimes the flights were delayed but all in all we arrived safe and in good shape. That's all I ask of any airline when push comes to shove. The little nitpicky stuff pales beside safety and the incredible shape and performance of the aircraft and pilots gets us all back home. I am liking this route now and will not hesitate to purchase from Rouge. I think they should be applauded for righting a wrong.
1187,Flew non-stop LAX to Berlin TXL on May 23 return on May 30th. Our first encounters with AirBerlin began with a series of phone calls to purchase premium seating a fairly common practice with airlines these days. The person on the other end was courteous professional and efficient. Personnel at the check-in counter at LAX were all friendly and helpful. Yes the seats in economy class have poor legroom - but so do AA and British Airways. The plane was spotless the entertainment top-notch and current just remember to have your headphones with you - otherwise 5??isn't bad for a set. We were served a beverage snack wine or a meal every time we turned around. Our plane left on time and arrived several minutes early.
1188,Miami-Berlin flight was great. Had to buy head sets for $7 I was little surprised. Staff very nice and professional food was great. Kids crying for 9 hrs but it wasn't the airline's fault. Little TVs for every passenger great selection of movies and music. I flew back to MIA with the same airline on the 28th. What a difference! No TV's head sets offered for $5 this time. Food was really bad staff not helpful. I asked for a pen stewardess replied I'm sorry and never came back other one saw a paper napkin on the floor and instead of picking I up she kicked it in the corner. I couldn't believe it was the same airline. Excellent experience on the way to Europe but not very good experience flying back.
1189,"MIA-DUS-BER. First impression was new airplane and very clean. Seats ok seat pitch compact. Staff correct but not very attentive and definitively rude when confronted. IFE excellent if you have brought your headphones or pay the ?? charge. The rest of the trip uneventful except for the very tired airport facilities at DUS and TXL. Return flight was nonstop TXL-MIA. Priority access only granted after insisting twice that we were Gold Status or OneWorld Ruby; nobody seems to have been instructed on what that means. Same plane IFE staff with a little better attitude though nowhere be found once they hand out ""the bottle of water"". Food was above average wine as always: one glass. Luggage handling ok. Rates are ok but same as other main carriers especially those belonging to One World. AB will have to do a lot to take advantage of their recent incorporation."
1190,"We flew the HNL-YYZ route on Air Canada rouge on our recent trip to Hawaii (we were originally booked on a Delta flight but decided to stay an extra week so ended up flying rouge home as it was the cheapest fare at the time) and like some of the reviewers wrote I was a little worried about this flight having read the reviews. Our flight was surprisingly drama-free and better than expected. Aside from the fact that the 767 was the same aircraft I flew to London (UK) with 9 years ago the cabin looked like it was given a new interior. Having known about the lack of food (to be honest none of the major North American airlines with the exception of Hawaiian Airlines will offer free meal service for economy passengers to and from Hawaii - ridiculous yes but that's a whole other battle) we brought our own food on the flight. Sure there wasn't PTV's or even an overhead screen however I did my due diligence and on the rouge website it does tell passengers to download the app to access the in-flight entertainment system. I was pretty impressed by the selection - new and old offerings. The cabin crew were young and did their job well. The seats were fine - typical seating in economy class on a domestic/US flight. We took the red-eye home (left HNL at 11pm) so we slept for most of the flight. All in all a normal flight that got us home 45 minutes early. One thing that people need to realize is that this is really Air Canada's ""discount"" version and as such I wouldn't get your hopes up too high about amenities when it comes to economy. Having travelled on many US airlines to and from Hawaii this was not bad. You want bad? Try American Airlines - the aircraft they used from DFW-HNL (and back!) was literally transported from the 80's. They didn't even bother to retrofit the interior cabin. From the cabin walls (with the tacky 80's floral design) to the video they used on the overhead screen (the on screen employees looked like they came from an early 90's MTV music video with the scrunchies and tacky shoulder pads). The flight was delayed from DFW. While it does put a damper on your Hawaiian vacation when the flight is less than perfect I would say rouge is a good and budget friendly option to get to paradise. Just make sure you know what to expect and be prepared and you'll be fine. Unfortunately you really can't ask for much nowadays when it comes to North American airlines and their ""domestic"" economy class system. If you want the amenities - I would highly suggest upgrading if budget allows and/or you have enough points to do so and fly Delta. Our flight from ATL-HNL in economy was the best experience - I could just imagine how heavenly their business/first class was on that flight. New Airbus with PTV's on every seat. While no free meal service in economy they offered four rounds of beverage service AND gave everyone a Hawaiian Host chocolate prior to landing in HNL as a ""first Aloha""."
1191,Business class from Vancouver to Seoul. Food quality was very good and flight attendants provided excellent service. Air Canada is obviously in tough competition on the Pacific routes from Asian airline competition and has improved the quality of its offering. Selection of movies could be improved though.
1192,Flew on AC33 and AC34 both flights were fantastic. Sat in seat 19c on both legs of the trip and the extra legroom was worth the money Got to Sydney and back home safely and customer service was excellent. Will definitely fly with Air Canada again.
1193,I fly Air Canada quite frequently for work between YVR (Vancouver) and YYC (Calgary). I switched over from WestJet after I had a bad experience of multiple late and delayed flights and I could not be happier! Flying with Air Canada in Canada is much better then flying with WestJet (from my own personal experience). I enjoy flying on the smaller ERJ 190s compared to a 737 on this route; less cramped and not as many people on board. I find that domestic check in with Air Canada moves quite smoothly with no real issues or problems. I have also noticed that Air Canada's prices are sometimes cheaper then WestJet (surprising I know). From my own personal experience I have to say the overall customer experience with Air Canada has improved quite a lot in the last number of years. Definitely recommend Air Canada on this route!
1194,Copenhagen-Berlin-Frankfurt. Booked so I could accumulate Qantas points. Qantas booked seats for me and all went smoothly. Check-in at CPH was fine priority check-in for Platinum member but staff did not know whether I could access the lounge or not - she suggested I try my luck at the lounge. Lounge at CPH was fine. A319 from Copenhagen to Berlin and 737-700 from Berlin to Frankfurt. Air Berlin cabin looks like a budget airline service was inconsistent. Copenhagen-Berlin flight staff were rude and unprofessional friendly and helpful from Berlin to Frankfurt. No lounge available in Berlin considering that is their home airport. Transit at Berlin airport is a nightmare only 50 minutes between flights. Security staff are slow and rude luggage arrived at Frankfurt airport pretty quickly. Air Berlin still have long way to go to meet the One World alliance standard.
1195,"Inaugural TXL-LAX flight Economy Class. Check-in uneventful boarding delayed 30 minutes however nobody seemed to mind since there was plenty of free food and beverages. Each passenger got a little souvenir upon boarding. Flight smooth arrival on-time. New clean cabin with a good 10"" touch screen IFE on demand with plenty of movies TV music and games comfortable seats. Attentive crew with plenty of water runs at some point they even handed out water bottles. However seat pitch is impossible. I am 6'3"" and if I had to actually sit during the entire flight (I had the entire 4-seat row to myself due to low passenger load) I would have ended with severe pain in my legs. When the passenger in the front reclines their head practically is in your face. Food was tasty but the portions tiny. Beer and wine for sale only except one glass of wine served with the main meal. Headphones for sale only. The crew didn't really care about keeping passengers in line so nobody bothered closing the sun shades after the main meal kids were left playing in the aisles unattended. Overall a good value for the price but still far from LH AF BA or KL standards. Nevertheless a great direct connection from Berlin to LA with a lot of potential."
1196,AC835 YUL to GVA January 21st 2015 Airbus A330 seat 38D. Not a very full flight so I was able to sleep on four empty seats. I skipped dinner but had breakfast (coffee orange juice slice of banana bread). Arrived in Geneva ahead of schedule. Cleared customs and collected my checked bags in record time.
1197,Berlin-Abu Dhabi-Phuket. Good things first: Flight crew very friendly very helpful making the best of the basic services Air Berlin provides. You receive a glass of wine with dinner (but they have to explain: only one!). Headphones are charged for 3 Euro. The onward boarding pass (Air Berlin flight Air Berlin plane) from Abu Dhabi to Phuket has to be picked up personally at Etihad counters in Abu Dhabi as Air Berlin cannot issue them - in Berlin! Overall - if cheaply priced ok. If expensive definitely not.
1198,FRA-TXL. The check-in area was nice and fast. The plane was in good shape left on time and they served a snack. Flight attendants were very attentive. Upon exiting the plane they handed out chocolates. Would happily fly them again.
1199,Despite other reviews I was very happy using services of Air Canada Rouge. Travelled March 8 2015 to March 15 2015 Toronto to Honolulu round-trip. Very good impression of them I'll use their services again for sure. The inflight entertainment was very good 120V plugs is excellent. Entertainment software work great for Android devices as well. Very friendly team on board excellent take off and landings.
1200,"I flew from YVR-HNL on March 6th and was assigned the one lonely seat right at the back of the plane in row 51. I asked the gate agent politely if there was any chance he could move me up. He was helpful and moved me up to Row 21 where there was an empty seat. The in-flight entertainment was ok for the 6+ hours flight enough to get me there (because I can't sleep on planes.) I was also starving halfway through the flight but wasn't interested in pay $13.50 for a wrap so shelled out the $4.50 for pretzels and hummus as there was no free snack offered to go with my Diet pop. My flight from HNL-YVR was cancelled. I had checked in online already but when I got to the airport (2 hours before take off) I noticed the lines at the ticket booths were not moving at all and there was an already overall miserable feeling mulling about between the guests. I overheard someone say the flight was cancelled. I never even received a notification regarding this fact until it was close to boarding time. There were already guests checked through bags checked and they were told to come back through security to the ticket booths so they could be assigned a hotel to stay at overnight. Our aircraft never showed up due to ""mechanical problems"". It wouldn't be departing until the following day at 1.30pm. All connecting flights in Vancouver to my final destination (Winnipeg) would've already been long gone so I would've been stuck with an overnight in Vancouver the following night. I was flying alone however the rest of my family was on a WestJet flight scheduled to leave 15 minutes after my flight was supposed to take off. I asked the lady at the ticket counter what my options were and if she'd be able to help get on the WestJet flight instead. She kept blowing me off telling me there was nothing she could do nor did she seem like she was willing to help me in anyway. The lady at the Westjet counter immediately took all information and got me on the flight with no problems. Needless to say Air Canada Rouge definitely disappointed me big time. No wonder the flight was ridiculously cheap!"
1201,Flight from Abu Dhabi to Phuket return. Codeshare with Etihad. Inflight entertainment zero seats small and service very mediocre. After serving an average meal the crew disappeared. On a 6-7 hour flight one would expect them to serve at least water between the main meal and the turkey/cheese roll before landing.
1202,TXL-ZRH-TXL weekly. Most of the time very punctual crew not always friendly but watch out if the flight is late in into TXL on Friday evenings. Only passengers with connecting flights can disembark. I do have a gold card with AB as did several of the people next to me but still we were hindered in getting out by a loud FA. So far I have always booked them as they are cheaper than LH or Swiss but I will definitely review that.
1203,Flew Berlin-Frankfurt which was fine. On the return Tel Aviv-Berlin. Flight delayed by an hour. No hot food just a sandwich - I expected a lot more on a medium haul flight. Staff were a bit rough around the edges and wore an awful black uniform. You had to pay 3 Euros for headphones to listen to the inflight entertainment. Money was the main motivation to fly them but not the overall service. Fine for short-haul but not for medium haul. The flight itself and landing etc were fine.
1204,I flew yesterday on Air Canada Rouge and expected only the worst from the angry reviews I've read. I've heard there was little to no leg room a terrible in-flight entertainment system and even worse customer service/delays. But none of these appeared to be true on my flight. First of all you can pay a little more for extra leg room and by doing so you get more room than you would on the main line. People may complain paying extra is ridiculous but if they're that concerned about not having enough room it's probably worth it. For the in-flight entertainment it was pretty weak. There are no longer TVs on the back of every seat like there are on the main airline. You can access it on your laptop tablets and phones but the content is limited and outdated. What I did and what I recommend doing is renting movies on your laptop or tablet or whatever prior to the flight so you can watch those without hassle. In regards to the delays I flew on Air Canada Rouge both ways and I didn't experience any delays either way. In fact I found they were quicker than the main airline. The one thing I do mind about the new charter airline is the in-flight entertainment. Oh well I guess it's the way of the future.
1205,"I flew from New York LaGuardia to Winnipeg via Toronto on December 22nd and return leg from Winnipeg to New York LaGuardia via Toronto was on January 9th. First check-in at LaGuardia was a nightmare long queues and no staff. Some of the customers complained to Air Canada agent and her reply was ""you should be happy for what you have"". Boarding was chaotic and plane departed 50 min late. On the way back boarding in Winnipeg took about 45 min because flight was full AC staff had to check in many bags into the hold of the aircraft. We departed 25 min late and arrived into Toronto 15 min behind the schedule. On the better note clean planes good legroom and awesome cabin crew who were attentive and kind to passengers. Checked in luggage arrived on the baggage belt within 15 min of our arrival."
1206,Living in Canada one must either fly with Air Canada or West Jet domestically and have to use one of them for the first part of any international flight. Air Canada never fails to disappoint with their service it is dismal to say the least. They charge for everything from earphones to food on domestic flights. Food on international flights is also poor. I recently had breakfast on Thai Airways Singapore Airways and Air Canada. The meal was almost identical in all three instances but the portion size and taste was significantly better on Thai and Singapore. The dinner meals on Air Canada were also less than impressive compared to the Thai and Singapore. On more than 1 occasion my personal TV didn't work properly and flights nearly always depart late. I have flown nearly all types of Air Canada aircraft (787 777 767 A321 (A320) A330) and while their larger aircraft are comfortable their older smaller aircraft are uncomfortable. In the event there is a problem and you need to contact someone be prepared to be put on hold for at least 1 hour. The last few times I have called 60 minutes was the quickest I was able speak to a human.
1207,YYZ to BGI return were both excellent flights. Attentive service great food snacks and lots to drink. The flight attendants were constantly replenishing whatever we were drinking. Flight to BGI was delayed two hours for de-icing but I just lay back on my fully flat bed. Coming home the weather was better so there were no delays. The lounges were good too as we enjoy the lattes at the Toronto lounge. The Barbados lounge is a bit more sparse but thankfully the air conditioning was not cranked up this time.
1208,YYZ-FRA-YYZ Business Class outbound on Lufthansa 747 code share which was a joy of comfort pleasant personable and attentive crew and with excellent catering and wines and return on Air Canada 777-200 with a sullen senior crew who greeted any request as a seemingly huge imposition and who disappeared at every opportunity when not dishing out the insipid catering. How this airline gets four stars and boasts about it is beyond me.
1209,Flew from Calgary to Narita before Christmas 2014 on a 767 economy. Food was horrible! Came back on a 787 to Vancouver. After 10 days in Japan I actually found the food on 787 to be good. Controls on the armrest are sensitive to the point of annoying. Slight elbow movement may trigger the entertainment screen to shut off or the overhead light to turn on or off. I usually put my carry-on with fragile stuff in front of me after seeing how they shove in the huge carry-ons with force. Should consider restricting the seat incline to a smaller angle. It's not fun have a seat in front of your face during a 10-hour flight.
1210,HAM-MUC-HAM: B737 700 and A320. Flights were 85 and 50% full on respective legs. Passengers greeted with unmotivated and crew giggling amongst themselves. Aircraft's clean enough and service friendly. Soft drinks and chips served. Both flights on time. Recently prices have gone up LH is offering cheaper tickets. I think its time to upgrade to LH.
1211,JFK-DUS. Flight boarded on time. Crew very hospitable and friendly. Served dinner an hour after take off meal tasty by airline standards although portions could have been a bit bigger. We were given a choice of a complementary cognac or ice cream for desert. Free beer and wine. Seats average or slightly below in terms of space and comfort. Breakfast was of a traditional German type - cold cuts and fruit. Flight crew bilingual some even spoke a handful of languages. IFE was the antiquated overhead CRT monitors. All in all a pleasant experience.
1212,BER-MIA nonstop service. Old A330-200 from LTU - seats do not fully recline but not a big issue for me personally. Lots of space. IFE very old small personal screen films shown nonstop not really usable. Supposedly with AB joining One World seats and IFE in both business and economy on longhaul will be replaced step by step. Very friendly service 2 flight attendants for business cabin. Very good food with three meals. Plenty of drinks. Flight on time. Crew provided lots of information during the flight and also about immigration process. Air Berlin really needs new planes and/or refurbish its longhaul planes to compete with other major carriers. If they do AB offers very good value for money.
1213,YOW-DCA on an RJ. Seat 1A (single cabin). No lounge access in YOW for US-bound passengers but was allowed to go through security to the AC domestic lounge. Very nice lounge with great view of the airfield good drinks and food (salads soups rolls snacks). Check-in agent for US departures for Star Alliance gold could not have been nicer or more obliging phoning around to see if I could use the domestic lounge. Flight delayed about 50 mins due to late arrival of the aircraft. On board the one FA was very nice and efficient. Captain kept everyone updated.
1214,Las Palmas to Stuttgart Jan 29 2012. Excellent service flight on time good food. Ordered breakfast online and received a nice and fresh sandwich on the side. Served refreshments 3 times during the 4 hour flight. Average pitch showed a movie on the overhead screens.
1215,I have always been extremely satisfied about Air Berlin services within Europe so I booked a flight to Bangkok. Unfortunately and amazingly the cabin quality was worse than in all major airlines which I have used before. Very little leg space poor food no individual entertainment system outbound but very good system inbound. The good thing: Very punctual!
1216,ZRH-TXL-BSL. Booked flights for a great price and paid for second row seat and had hand luggage only. Both time outside the Terminal in minutes. Service was friendly. Free Sandwich and soft drinks. Good value for money and way ahead of low-cost carrier. Internet Check-in fine as well. Overhead screens for short haul.
1217,I flew Air Canada Rouge and was appalled at how cramped the seats are. They are narrow and so close to the seat in front I don't know how a tall person could even fit their legs in. Or travel for longer than the 3 hours I did. Not comfortable. The flight attendants were very friendly and competent.
1218,"I was legitimately quite concerned flying AC-Rouge from OGG-YVR on an overnight flight this past February. Reviews of dirty planes incompetence and no seat room had me lamenting my end of my vacation (more so) than usual. I am 6""4 most planes have a lack of room for someone of my height. I had built Rouge to be this awful thing after all it's transport how bad could it be. Honestly it wasn't horrid. Granted I had this flight through points I would be furious if it was purchased full fare for business. But as a leisure airline overnight where most passengers are sleeping it did the trick. I did not have a premium seat or exit row. Yes it was tight but I fit in there ok seems to be a theme most flights I'm on have little to no leg room this felt no worse. The entertainment system was moot as it was overnight. Cabin was quiet well served (yes those outfits are idiotic) and I think they know it too. But overall it was not the horrid experience I would have expected."
1219,December 23rd 2011 my teenage son and I travelled from JFK to TXL. Everything was smooth staff were friendly and accommodating. Their service and the quality of food and drinks was outstanding - we couldn't have asked for a better start to our vacation. We experienced the same on our way back on New Year's Eve they even served complementary sparkling wine to ring in the New Year.
1220,Flew YVR - LHR - YVR in Executive first. The so called new suite on Air Canada's Boeing 777 on select routes only must be one of the worst business class seats ever designed. I was seated in 2D. When you first arrive at your seat you think that you have plenty of space. However once seated you soon feel very claustrophobic. The large arm rest on the left is made up by the very small armrest on the right which puts you very close to your neighbour. Just sitting normally ones left arm/hand naturally rests on the seat controls so without warning your seat starts moving. The tray table has a 3 phase deployment which could only be done by cabin crew. All passengers battled. Your seat can only be upright or flat with no in between settings. When flat the massage function on my seat would not turn off. It would only turn off when upright. When flat your feet go under the seat in front leaving no room to move your legs around. It's like laying in a coffin. There is no ground area for any luggage and no space for your duvet or pillow (which you are not allowed at your feet for take off / landing). All in all a very badly designed seat. I wasn't a great fan of the previous pod system but it is far better than this current design. I would rather have flown BA even with the backward facing seats. Service was good and the staff cannot be blamed for the tools they have been given to work with. I have had better comfort and sleep traveling in Economy.
1221,My wife and daughter flew Thailand to UK via Dusseldorf. The flights were ok though connection was missed in Dusseldorf due to late departure. No information given to people waiting at Stansted arrivals. Eventually my wife and daughter were put on a flight to Heathrow. The bags did not arrive with them so we had to spend the night near Heathrow and return in the morning. The bags did not arrive so we travelled home to the Isle of Wight. We incurred extra costs for the overnight stay none of which have been reimbursed after repeatedly contacting customer services. I understand these things happen concerning the original late departure but don't expect any help if things go wrong!
1222,KEF-DUS-FCO. First time with Air Berlin. Everything went smoothly before departure from Keflavik and we arrived on time in Germany. The seats and sandwiches were ok but I didn't care for the inflight entertainment. Flight attendants were friendly. All in all good value for money.
1223,Alicante to Lisbon via Palma de Mallorca. First leg with AB second leg with FlyNiki. Both new comfortable planes. Pleasant crew. On time. Unfortunately at PdM instead of boarding the Lisbon flight my suitcase went to Frankfurt. However I was very impressed with the speed with which it was discovered and dispatched on the first available Lufthansa flight to Lisbon and was in my hotel before 9am the next morning. Got a numbered seat and a snack all for the same price as low cost companies like Ryanair and Easyjet.
1224,B787 AC004 NRT to YVR Dec 22nd 2014 seat 3G. Offered menu choices soon after take off by meal time we were informed that they had run out of the beef option. In Business class no less! My wife didn't want the alternatives and therefore declined to eat. I told the attendant to give the beef to her and I'll have the salmon. The service director explained that even though we were full paying passengers there is a priority system there in terms of menu items. They had to take care of their Elite Super Elite and Million Milers before the others. We found this unbelievable in terms of a company policy. How much can it cost Air Canada to provide sufficient meal choices in J class? As it turned out the beef tenderloin was anything but tender or tasty. The rest of the flight was uneventful the seat was fairly comfortable and converted to flat bed easily. Turbulence prevented hot drinks service but that wasn't anyone's fault. The movie and TV choices were pretty pathetic compared to having just come off a Singapore Airlines business class segment from SIN to NRT. There was no comparison in the level of service the comfort and width of the seat and the meals. In fact when I mentioned this to the AC service director she candidly admitted that she was aware that they did not match up to SQ or Emirates in J class. I felt sorry for her as she was attentive a hard worker and did her best but had to comply with a restrictive mandate working for an airline that has a lot of room to improve.
1225,Flew on AC 855 from LHR to YVR on December. 22 in economy. Crew attentive throughout flight. Lots of water juice and ice cream between meals. Lunch better than many offerings in other airlines' economy cabins. Wine quality well above average. Air Canada seem to have finally fixed their often faulty IFE system. Plenty of music and film choices though latest film selections could have been better. The downside? Like other airlines Air Canada has reconfigured economy seating with four seats now in the centre section. As a results seats and aisles are very narrow. Not too uncomfortable for a daytime flight but I'd find it impossible to sleep on an overnight flight.
1226,MIA-DUS Business Class. Boarding quick and on time arrival in Dusseldorf on time. Business class is not comparable to others as the seats don't fully recline. This was more than compensated by very comfortable seats and a seat distance which is quite generous - you can easily step over neighbours seat. Crew was friendly and attentive. In view of the price business class is value for money if you don't need full recline on your seat but favour more space and friendly service.
1227,YVR-DUS A330 DUS-STN - Q400 DUS-NYC A330 flights all enjoyable. Service friendly and included nice extra touches - candies as you board chocolates as we got off one flight overnight pack on long haul. Two hot meals on YVR-DUS-NYC tasty by airline standards. Seat width and pitch as you would expect. The inflight entertainment was shown on overhead screens rather than PTV on demand. I'll take low fares and great service with limited entertainment.
1228,MUC-HAM A320. Passengers greeted with staff busy chatting amongst themselves. Announcements by pilot in English and German. Seats beside me were dirty. Served salty or sweet snack with choice of cold drinks juice and coffee. Flight landed on time.
1229,I have had consistently good service with them over the last 40 years I have flown with them (and I am not an employee!) AC Rouge is a leisure carrier and not a five star airline like Emirates. You get what you pay for. Granted AC seriously screwed up by replacing out some of their key regular services with Rouge without telling customers. Not cool. That being said this little airline is not bad. The crews while young are actually very pleasant and eager to please. The uniforms are smart and they seem proud to wear them (the hats are a nice touch too. The food was tasty and satisfying. Not super high class but nice to get something that didn't make you gag. The service was attentive and I appreciated the new premium seating in the 767's. My airplane was clean (even after a quick turnaround after a 6 hour weather delay). My only wish is that they had service like Sunwing where everyone got a meal and there was inflight entertainment (even on the screens overhead) for all. Personally this airline is ok to fly for flights that are under 6 hours. Given the limited legroom do spend the money and fly the other classes. They give you more room and more attention. Overall I was nervous flying them after the horrendous reviews but in the end I really had a nice flight.
1230,"Decided a few years ago to commit to flying with Air Canada (live in Toronto) as I knew I would be traveling quite a bit to London for work and for consistency of booking and to take advantage of the loyalty program I wanted to stick with one airline. As a disclaimer for these flights I was not ""overly"" concerned about pricing but rather timing and comfort. That said I definitely wasn't willing to pay insane prices. In my opinion and for how I was traveling Air Canada has been by far the best airline I have traveled with (I have not flown airlines such as Emirates as they don't offer the routes I need but of course I have heard good things). There is no question that a direct AC flight to your destination might be more expensive than flying with another airline with one or 2 connections. If you are not too worried about spending more time traveling and in result save a few bucks - then go for it. That said where AC really shines is comfort and from my experiences service. The no. 1 reason I fly AC is comfort. In economy there is a good amount of leg room. If you disagree try flying United in row 30 and then report back. Secondly there is free in-flight entertainment in every seat. The flight from Heathrow to Toronto will fly by with a movie and some TV shows. Thirdly the first class cabin on the YYZ-LHR route was incredible. I am a light sleeper and also 6'2"" and even with the decent economy seats in AC economy I still have trouble sleeping. As most of the YYZ to LHR flights are red-eyes and I need to be rested for meetings when I arrive - I often spent the extra money (or later on upgrade credits) to fly in business. I don't care if Emirates gives you a hot towel to exfoliate your face halfway through the flight what AC provided was a great lay-flat bed in a semi-private pod and I got a good 6 hours of sleep. It was invaluable. Where the true service came through was on the return. When getting a ride back to LHR there was crazy traffic on the M1. Airlines recommend arriving to LHR three hours before your flight. I arrived 45 mins before the flight. The AC staff were so helpful in getting me checked in and somehow got me on a golf cart and I was driven through the bowels of the airport escorted through security back on another golf cart that drove through random hallways passed luggage belts arriving right at the gate just before they closed the doors. Sure maybe some of that treatment was because I was booked in the first class cabin but I have had equally great experiences when booked in economy."
1231,HAM-MUC B737-700. Acceptable leg room for tall person. Announcement by pilot in English and German. Flight was about 45% full. Passengers served bread roll coffee and juice. Toilets were dirty. Since we did not get landing on Munich airport we were flying around for about 45 minutes. All in all a pleasant experience.
1232,London Stansted to FMO Munster. Fast check-in and easy boarding. Full plane but even on a short flight crew managed to give everyone a snack and a drink. Seats ok for a short flight and English papers provided. Munster airport large but very little traffic luggage unloaded quickly. Perfectly acceptable flight but not cheap.
1233,Business class Vancouver to Dusseldorf. AB uses the Priority Pass lounge at YVR which was fine. No current newspapers due to a delivery problem but when asked about this the concierge immediately went and purchased a copy. Business Class was only half full at the end of AB's summer schedule. Food was fantastic - a choice of four entrees plus a fifth 'special' dish available. Seats in Business are old type non-flat bed with limited video choices however they were comfortable. On time arrival in Dusseldorf which is an easy airport to navigate. A great bargain and a great flight.
1234,Flew between Toronto and Samana Dominican Republic - Feb 7-14/15. Yes the seats are extremely cramped and the armrest between my partner and I wouldn't stay up (to allow us a bit of extra room). Heaven forbid the person in front of you reclines. The least they could do is give you a free sandwich on flights over 3.5 hours. Brought my own iPad with ACRouge app downloaded but the content was severely lacking (old old TV shows and movies). But the service was attentive and friendly (both at check-in and on-board) and the flight was on time both ways. Could have been worse.
1235,"Have flown Air Canada Rouge twice both times Vancouver to Las Vegas. First time we got an email telling us about IPAD Wifi based entertainment system - download the App and make sure your IPAD is charged. I prefer this entertainment system to the low res pound the seat back screens on AC. Better picture and sound. Most times I won't watch a good movie on AC because I would rather watch it at home on my big screen but I don't mind watching on my IPAD. The seats are merely OK but not instruments of torture like some people maintain. Read the in flight magazine to compare the AC vs ACRouge layout and you will see how many more seats they have jammed in. I can understand people being ticked paying Biz class for Premium Rouge as there is no comparison. Both trips YVR- LAS were on time. Staff are young and can be a little snippy but consider how many people they have jammed into the aircraft. I am not complaining as I got great value Whitehorse to Las Vegas - $212.00 all in and LV to Van for $175.00. I am 63 years old 5""10"" 170 lbs and I had no trouble walking etc after the flights."
1236,Just flew Paris-Montreal round trip for work in economy on 777-300ERs (both ways). Really excellent entertainment system had a plug for my laptop in the seat and very friendly and helpful cabin crew. Not much they could do about the continuous turbulence on the way back which forced us to stay buckled up all the way but handled it with good humour. Two thumbs up!
1237,Dusseldorf to Vancouver in Business class. The AB lounge is about 10 yrs out of date only one English language newspaper limited seating no wifi. On time departure with Business Class cabin only 40 % full. Onboard only one English magazine. Four meal choices and good service (2 attendants having little to do with only 10 passengers).
1238,TXL-CGN-TXL. Booking and check-in online was easy. A new and clean A320 to Cologne. Nice staff and good snack. Arrival earlier than scheduled helpful for me because of train connection. In the evening back to Berlin with 15 minutes delay due to problems before boarding. Plane was an older B737 but fine. Staff helpful and snack tasty. All in all good value for money. Professional and friendly attitude gave me two relaxed hops which I enjoyed.
1239,Booked our Jan 2015 family vacation flight with rouge YYZ to MCO. First time on rouge and yes the economy seat was tight for me 6' fine for my shorter wife and young son although tolerable for me for this short of a flight anything longer than 3 hours would be uncomfortable. But I knew all this before our flight A/C tells you the seat pitch and everything else such as inflight entertainment on their web page and through emails multiple times. So it was exactly what I expected and paid for inexpensive basic transport to Orlando FL. Flights were on time both ways service personal were friendly and competent aircraft was clean food/drinks were fine. Will fly again if fairs remain inexpensive.
1240,DUS-LAX outbound SFO-DUS inbound both on a A330 with significant differences. Traveling as a family with two teenagers we reserved our seats 6 months before and got them without problem on both legs rows 38/39. Outbound flight with good seats and crew. Good food constant service with soft drinks complimentary wine made the 11 hrs nearly a pleasure even in Economy Class. Unusable IFE with small screens high above slight delay of 30 min. Inbound older plane with bad seats cushions worn out. Crew professional and friendly service ok with decent meals and good supply of soft drinks and wine. Overhead screens even worse bring your own entertainment.
1241,I traveled from Toronto to Cancun 1/22/15 and returned 1/29/15 on Air Canada Rouge. After having read so many negative reviews I was prepared for a poor experience. Fortunately I had just the opposite. The plane was clean and the attendants were pleasant and professional. I was disappointed however with the collection of chewing gum left by previous passengers in an unreachable space between the floor and the window. Surely gum could be disposed of in a more sanitary way. Food was adequate and no more but I've had worse on regular flights. For a discount airline I received what I paid for and commend the staff for super attitude.
1242,On Dec 6th our scheduled flight from Vancouver to Nanaimo took off as planned. We had been informed that Nanaimo Airport has a critical density of fog but that they would try to get everybody across. The landing could not be done due to the fog so they flew us back to Vancouver. By that time it was close to midnight. All passengers were asked to go to a nearby service desk. Every single party received a voucher for the Fairmont Airport Hotel and everybody was re-booked for the first flight to Nanaimo the next morning. Very smooth! Very generous!
1243,YYZ to YYC on a pristine 767 good cabin crew lead by an impressive bilingual flight director. Impressed by the improvements to the food offerings. YYC to YLW on a CRJ with an outgoing friendly flight attendant. Good flights good service.
1244,"LHR-YYZ YYZ-YOW YOW-YYC YYC-YYZ YYZ-LHR. Each flight was fantastic. The long haul flights were flown on the 777-300 with the standard Executive Pods they are a favourite of mine. The food was fantastic on all the flights Air Canada has recently started a ""room service"" style breakfast on flights to Europe. You get an order card and tick off everything you want at night before you go to bed and in the morning have it delivered at your chosen time. Great new idea. Staff onboard were fantastic as usual. Can't wait for my next trip!"
1245,BKK-DUS return in Business Class. The airline is extremely tough on luggage allowance. Check-in staff not friendly either end and boarding in both cities was chaotic. BKK boarding was late no proper announcements from unfriendly staff chaos in Dusseldorf as boarding was through one door for all pax and cabins no pre boarding for children special needs or premium pax. Cabin crew on both legs were smiling and cheerful for the whole flight. 2 crew serving 24 Business passengers leads to somewhat slow service however it's personal and friendly. Seats average only reclining and not lie flat seats. IFE poor with looping programs and AVOD. One suitcase lost on return but returned within 48 hrs. Just a shame the onboard experience is let down by ground services.
1246,Frankfurt to Munich via Berlin. Onboard service for such a short flight was slick and efficient with a snack and drink. Very short transfer time in Berlin meant my baggage did not arrive in Munich. Air Berlin didn't let me down - baggage arrived the following day to my rural alpine chalet.
1247,CPH-TXL return. Boarding was a mess with everyone rushing onboard. CPH-TXL slept through the flight. TXL-CPH flight I wanted to have a second drink and I stopped and asked the stewardess for a cup of water and was told to wait. She walked pass again without stopping back to the gallery. I pressed the call button and when the same stewardess came she refused to serve me as we were landing soon.
1248,PMI-OVD. Took off on time nice beverage onboard hot and cold drinks free. Cabin crew can not speak a word of Spanish only English and German. I have flown many years with AB and the service is excellent.
1249,When I first read all the terrible reviews for Air Canada Rouge I was very reluctant to travel with them. I couldn't believe how angry people were. So needless to say I expected the worst but I chose to make the best of it because my trip had already been booked. I had a fantastic trip! Comparable to any flight I've taken with AC or otherwise. The seating was a bit tight but comfortable enough (granted I am a shorter person). Limited storage space so best to bring a carry-on that you can fit under your seat. The food was delicious and the best price for airplane food I've seen. A large glass of wine a sandwich and a snack for 13.50. The movie selection had plenty to choose from and entertainment app was easy enough to use. Flight arrival was on time both ways. Staff were very nice and helpful. So I may be alone in this but I would definitely fly Rouge again.
1250,Why would Air Canada put Rouge planes on flights to Phoenix and San Diego when they have almost a monopoly of these flights and always full. Just to give less service. Had booked premium rouge and pre-chose seats. On return they switched my seats so my wife and I were now not together. This is taking care of customers. Avoid Rouge whenever it's possible. I will now fly Alitalia to Italy if AC keeps these old planes on the route.
1251,"AC flight 85 YYZ-TLV in business. The flight was flawless service was excellent food was good to excellent. The AC 787 is an amazing product well designed and comfortable. Missing overhead bins in the center above rows 4 and 5 made for a few uncomfortable minutes as we boarded - flight attendants should anticipate this and be available to help. The seat is excellent long enough and wide enough. Yes the foot well is narrow but I got comfortable and slept deeply for 4 hours (same issue on Swiss United ANA). The pillow and comforter are far better than those offered by United Swiss Lufthansa. The adjustable cushions make it the best Business seat I have experienced. Topping it all off is the 18"" screen along with a well designed hand controller with its own fully functional LCD touch screen."
1252,TXL-BKK return. Nice FA's on both flights. Leg Room could be bigger but was ok. Meals where hot and of good taste. No Delay. Luggage was there on time and without any damages.
1253,MUC-HAM return. Both flights on time smiling cabin crew sufficient leg room. Onboard service a snack and all kinds of drinks. My preferred airline for domestic trips in Germany as they deliver a reliable service.
1254,Barcelona to Dusseldorf. Very nice crew and friendly. We got a salami or cheese sandwich and 1 or 2 drinks. Very clean and modern airplane. Shared IFE screens throughout the cabin. Airbus A320. Arrived at Dusseldorf a few minutes ahead of schedule.
1255,AC1224 Jan 26 2015 Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. Return: Feb 6th 2015 AC 939. Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. Air Canada cater to the handicap. Helping them in and out of their airline seat we had priority seating throughout. Departure and arrival the porters were wonderful taking you right to the exit making sure you got into handicap taxi. The food onboard was nice hot when came to seat. Staff were patient.
1256,Frankfurt to Toronto and Toronto to Halifax 20 November 2014. Lufthansa from Bremen to Frankfurt to start the trip check in very efficient flight on time and efficient. Frankfurt airport needs to have better internal direction for connecting passengers. AC flights on time service efficient and as expected in economy meals ok for economy. Cabin staff were pleasant and efficient nice to see a difference here to some previous flights. Overall price and value for money no complaints.
1257,SFO-Dusseldorf-Barcelona. Service better than expected from a low cost carrier. Free international newspapers and magazines upon entering the aircraft. Hot meals with complimentary wine. Constant complimentary drink service throughout the flight. IFE was shared screen with headphones priced at 5 Euros. However a 10 hr flight on an A330 is the maximum one could take before the restrooms and cabin start to become uncomfortable and dirty. Connection at Dusseldorf was a bit confusing due to the on-going construction and limited passenger seating areas. Dusseldorf airport is a duty free shopping centre with passenger amenities as an afterthought. Dusseldorf to Barcelona on A320 was great. Again complimentary drinks and sandwiches. IFE was shared screen.
1258,STR-HAM one way. Very pleasant flight no lines at check-in on time nice cabin crew one round of drinks with choice of cookies or crackers 737-700 clean and well prepared. Pitch between seats could be one or two inches more. Cheap fare since we booked 4 months in advance. Overall: very good!
1259,Passenger cabin was ok legroom was enough for a small person. Cabin crew especially female FA's were not friendly and seemed irritated and annoyed. Service was not worth the price.
1260,"YVR to NRT. First off you can fly YVR to Haneda on ANA. I recommend that route. Narita is such a hassle even on the ""direct"" NEX train it takes an hour into Tokyo and that is after the long haul flight after Customs after waiting for a train before you transfer again in Tokyo or even if your hotel is near a station make the 900 meter walk out of Tokyo Central or Shinagawa. (I am not exaggerating. The time it takes to wheel your luggage from the NEX at Central to the lobby at the Shangri-La is nearly 20 minutes and that's when the station is relatively quiet.) AC was using an older aircraft on this route and it wasn't really too noticeable until we flew back on something much better (Cathay). The biz config in AC with their very comfortable if a tad firm lie flat seats afford privacy and ensure a good rest. The AV system is good although the screens aren't too big. Crew was extremely attentive and very friendly. One even had a sense of humour! The first meal was half decent quite good. The second a breakfast was mediocre. I find the ""second"" meal on AC long haul flights is always a letdown. The wine on AC could be better. On Cathay they were serving better champagne a wonderful Saint Veran a superb Gruner Vetliner and a lot of other wines that had obviously been tested at 39000 feet. Most AC wines just don't make the cut at the altitude. This was a points flight but if I was paying I would definitely choose ANA."
1261,ZRH-TXL-CPH in Economy Class. All flights on time cabin service good (free drinks) and FA's had a positive attitude. Legroom could be better. I'm impressed they actually managed to get my transfer luggage to my destination given the connection time in TXL was only 25 mins.
1262,DUS-MUC-MBA and return on A330 in their Business product. Excellent value for money and good service. Friendly flight attendants with a good sense of humour in Business both a bit older and probably because of that very professional. Seats good for C-Class on a holiday carrier. Great choice of meals and excellent quality.
1263,I use AB several times throughout the summer between FRA and Spain. No matter what the flight is always jammed packed with screaming babies and out of control children. Best tip is to avoid any seat toward the front where they tend to sit. It can be unbearable and airlines need to address this problem soon. Cabin crew are usually good and cabin service is fine.
1264,Flew Air Canada Rouge from Montreal to Orlando and then Orlando back to Toronto. The staff were young but very professional and friendly. Very impressed. The complementary drinks were as excepted and I hate airplane food so I was very happy no one included myself was buying any. Both flights I was able to get preferred economy seats at no charge (once at airline kiosk and once at the gate) Had exit row seats both flights and i have never had so much leg room and recline in economy. It is worth paying extra for preferred economy because the back of the plane looked like a sardine jar! Overall extremely satisfied! My only complaint is that you can watch entertainment with the android app which is so stupid as far more people have android than apple!
1265,Vancouver-Beijing in Business Class. Plane had the older pod seats which are comfortable but starting to show their age and could use some touch-up. Outstanding crew with every member very friendly and professional along with superior catering and generous amounts of good wines. Lights dimmed perhaps a bit quickly to encourage us to go to sleep but on the whole a much better business class experience than most other airlines.
1266,"I recently travelled on AC from Vancouver to Heathrow and back. I had a premium economy seat booked on the outbound leg and an economy seat for the return but had purchased a preferred seat. I upgraded to business class on both legs on check in for $900 on the way out and 900 Pounds on the way back! AC have managed to hide their business check-in at YVR and LHR I had to ask both times where it was. At YVR its basically in the Domestic check- in section of the airport. The check-in agent mentioned that I had a good seat (4A) which is a single seat by itself. My heart sank a little when she mentioned that the aircraft had a 'high density' configuration. Airline speak for a plane where they have crammed in more seats. Onboard I found the new business seating terrible clearly designed for short narrow people. Once the seat is in lay flat mode your legs go into a narrow gap under the seat in front of you. I'm 6' and 230lbs and had a few centimetres of room to the side and above before my lower legs were hitting the sides of the available space. The seat feels narrower than before making the whole thing coffin like. The pods were much better and offered more privacy. This particular seat had excessively large armrests some of that space would have been better used to widen the seat. Where the seat controls are positioned you will hit them when you use the armrests in the regular fashion causing the seat to move when you don't want it to. When I mentioned to one of the cabin crew about the seat comfort he said ""I know we're ripping them out'. Clearly gone are the days of the $600 or less last minute upgrade to business. I don't think that the new charges justify what you get. Otherwise the staff were friendly enough the food was ok and the cabin was too hot. If you happen to do an upgrade to business from economy and paid for an economy cabin preferred seat email them to get your $90 back otherwise you wont get it. Finally I had a look behind the curtain at Premium Economy certainly didn't look like the pictures on the AC website which gives the impression that its somewhat separate from regular economy it isn't. Although I make an internal connection within the UK from Heathrow I will be giving KLM a try next time to Amsterdam where onward connections are still good. Their business upgrades are typically $500."
1267,FRA-TXL-BKK in C. Very friendly staff. Good Menus. Super service from BKK-Pattaya free Limousine service. Sure we fly again with Air Berlin.
1268,AC 1827 on 28 January Vancouver to Kahului Maui. First time flying on Air Canada Rouge. Excellent flight. Will have to see if the same service is on the return flight.
1269,AC 25 YVR-PVG return. Had the privilege to fly the AC brand new Dreamliner. Gentile lighting changes dimmable windows comfy seats and less noise. The flight crew is composed of English-French and English-Mandarin staff. Most of the crew were very pleasant. Drinks and foods were served on time extras were given upon request. Water was served periodically during sleep time. Although I never watch any movies on flights I did go through their collection. I must say the number of titles in stock was massive. You'd be more than satisfied if you enjoy IFE on long hauls. Another thing I've noticed is that travelers get updates from the pilots before taking off and landing and I don't see this happening for other Asian carriers. This is a feature some people enjoy and it is also an annoyance for some other people.
1270,Faro-PMI-ZRH. Online check-in went very well and was happy being able to skip the queues at the airport as was travelling with hand luggage only. Faro-PMI was flown by an A321 by Niki. Seat pitch tight. FA's are dressed casually so is the service as well. One gets free soft drinks and a sandwich. Inflight Entertainment on this hop was Audio although they can show films as well. Service not bad but not great either. Flight PMI-ZRH was delayed as well due to some passengers arriving late who obviously didn't come from a connecting flight. Their luggage should be simply offloaded. Crew rather distant and seemed unorganised. But not unfriendly. Sandwich and drinks again but Zanzibar meals could be ordered. Value for money. Take you from A to B. Better than low cost but not better than other full service carriers.
1271,FRA-PMI-FRA Very friendly crew and spotless cabin. Pre-ordered meals good value for money. Check-In swift and friendly. Much better than competitors on same route.
1272,Helsinki-Berlin-Helsinki. Bought tickets quite early so got these quite good price. Flights were packed since it was Eastern holiday. No check-in queues in Helsinki or Berlin. Flights were on time so nothing to complain. Free sandwich and soft drinks were offered that is big plus.
1273,Recently travelled AC Rouge to/from Cuba. This was a short flight of 3.5 hours. The seats were comfortable but not roomy. My husband and I left the arm rest between us in the upright position so did not feel as restricted. There is no on-board entertainment but I-Pads could be rented for $10.00. We had researched the airline and were aware of the lack of entertainment so we were prepare with our own - book cross stitch music crossword puzzles etc. The food provided (charged to your credit card) was fresh and tasty. The flight attendants were very young and needed a bit more experience in customer service. TIP - book your seat prior to flight and near the front section of the plane sometime run out of food choices by the time they get to the back part of the plane. Would not want to take AC Rouge on a much longer flight. There is not a lot of room between the seats and almost nil when the person in the seat in front of you reclines their seat.
1274,Toronto to Fort Lauderdale on October 27 with October 28 return. All flights on time. Aircraft clean and attendants do their job. Several water runs in addition to the usual beverage service. IFE quite decent. Not sure why Air Canada typically assigns a middle seat hoping to coerce you into buying an upgraded better seat. Seems a bit petty but despite the hoards of negative reviews I'm quite satisfied with Air Canada.
1275,AC through its contract partner Sky Regional YUL-YTZ (RT DH4 service). Although the equipment is old and the seating is cramped the overall flight experience was good. Advance check-in eliminated the hassle of YUL check-in and aside from a change in gate at departure everything went smoothly. Changing my departure on the return was easily done at the airport by a pleasant agent. I used the MLL in YUL courtesy of my Elite status. Although the lounge was crowded I was surprised by the improved range of food available. The MLL agent was polite and smiling (in the past they have been grouchy). Significant improvement at the YUL MLL in the last year. The departure area at YTZ is shared with Porter and is run down shabby and crowded. Both flights were nearly on time despite weather conditions. This was my first use of AC at YTZ in many years as I have been a loyal client of Porter. I gave AC a try because of my displeasure with my past Porter flights specifically the deterioration in service and on time performance. AC is just as good if not better than Porter on this route and with my FF status the AC experience was superior overall. AC is excellent when there are no IROPS no baggage and it is a short haul flight.
1276,BER-MUC. Extremely pleased with the airline and above expectation. There was no food but a hard tasteless piece of bread was given to those who wanted to risk it. Seats comfortable and though the flight was packed it felt spacious.
1277,Salzburg to Berlin and Berlin to Dusseldorf and extremely impressed. I paid very cheap rates for European flights (only about 90 euros per person) but got very good treatment - from newspapers and magazines to a nice snack and drinks. Seats comfortable. I couldn't get over the fact that this was supposed to be a low cost airline.
1278,Business Class DUS-BKK. No separate boarding line. A330 business seats ageing do not recline more than 150Â° but comfort was better than feared. IFE not AVOD and only small screen. Food was ambitious and tasty. Wine list was short but okay (no Champagne). Value for money was okay on the edge to slightly overpriced. Due to the outdated cabin frequent travellers may find better options in other airlines.
1279,HAM-FRA-HAM. Best price on this route also good service including drinks and snacks. Ground service was okay flight was on time.
1280,"Flew on an early morning flight from YVR to LAX. As soon as I boarded the plane I was a little taken aback at how many seats there were (and I travel a lot and have seen a lot of aircraft). I sat in 51F which is right at the back of the plane (as in last row). It's a 3 seater row (with adjustable arm rests) so I had plenty of space to move around freely. However any other of the seating and it would be a very tight fit. I'm a larger guy so I tend to get the aisle seat but I found that the rest of the craft would've been very cramped for my size. Just enough leg room I'm 5""9 and I was barely touching the seat in front of me. Any taller and it would be painful."
1281,ZRH to DUS and back on a day-trip. Flying Air Berlin is a bit like taking the regular bus- service. Nothing is outstanding or done in a personal way. Staff doing their job without any kind of special attention. Cabin usually clean and flights on time. However you get what you pay for and this is okay for the flights in Europe below 2 hours. Air Berlin has developed a product that is by far better than many low cost carriers but does not match the legacy carriers.
1282,TXL-MIA-TXL. Staff though not as professional as Lufthansa were polite and present - drinks given out regularly restrooms checked. Seat comfort great we paid for bulkhead XL Seats (highly recommended). Food was good. IFE was dated (wall/ceilling mounted monitors) the movie choice was entertaining. Amenity kits distributed so no reason for complaint whatsoever. Looking forward to the makeover of their A330-200s with new seats and IFE.
1283,HAM-VIE-HAM. The staff at check in friendly and gave desired seat. Flight boarding started in time announcements in German and English. Food satisfactory for a low cost airline. The flight back was also satisfactory with 3 rows empty from behind so had much space.
1284,Cologne to Hamburg Lufthansa flight was cancelled and I was rebooked on Air Berlin. Everything was okay flight on time on a new 737. TV screens show flight routing and got coffee juice and a warm roll for breakfast on a 35 minutes flight. Bags arrived on belt in normal time.
1285,Having had two bad experiences with Air Canada I will never fly with them again. First issue: Booked to depart Vancouver at 0800 on 1 Aug 14 on a flight to Toronto we arrived at the airport early. Checked our bags and got our boarding passes however on the boarding pass it did not have a seat allocation but indicated that this would be done at the gate no problem. As we had cleared security and it was now only 0620 we casually got a coffee and wandered up to the gate. On arrival at the gate my wife went to the desk to get our seat allocation only to be berated by the desk person who told her they had been paging us we didn't hear anything. He then informed her that our flight was boarding. We said that our flight wasn't until 0800 he then told us that our original flight was delayed until 1000 and we had been placed on the one now departing. Obviously had we not arrived early we would have been waiting around until 1000. All well and good but why weren't we informed of the change when we check in? Arriving early in Toronto messed with our booked transport which caused a few anxious moments and we had to get a taxi however thanks to Viator we got a refund on our transport booking. Second issue: The next flight was from Toronto to Seattle (E90) 3 Aug 14. On this fight the cabin crew showed a complete disregard for the comfort of the passengers. We were seated in the second last row of seats and were very conscious of people using the toilet no problem. However the flight had a number of turbulence issues and at one stage the line up for the toilet was half way up the cabin. On a number of occasions people asked if they could use the toilet at the front of the aircraft and this was denied. It did not help matters with the seatbelt sign going on and off. At one stage a young girl who had been waiting a long time got to the front of the line only to be told to go back and put her shoes on. I have never been told to put my shoes on. Anyway all that said I will never fly Air Canada again. The first impression is always the best and lasting impression.
1286,Business class Berlin - Bangkok. I am surprised about the airport which really needs a re-vamp but I am sure that will happen. After check we were given vouchers to go to the BA lounge in the connecting arrivals terminal which was nice. Business class passengers boarded the bus 1st and then called all the other passengers onto the same bus - so we got off last. Large and comfortable seats flight attendants came around with welcome drinks. The only problem was the inflight entertainment - not much choice and a lot of interference. Apart from that very impressed and would choose this airline again. Also the price we paid was excellent!
1287,I travelled from London Heathrow to Calgary return. Check in was speedy. There wasn't a queue to get through security so the Fast Track didn't make much difference. The lounge at Heathrow was spacious and comfortable and the food selection was fine. The 1:2:1 seat formation ensured privacy and the lie flat seat was comfortable and just wide enough. I'm 5ft 7in but if you were much taller or bigger it would be a tight squeeze. The food selection was ok fish meat or veggie but all choices were available. My salmon was well cooked and the vegetables were hot and not overcooked. There was a choice of 2 white wines one of which was not available due to all stock being used on the incoming sector! Come on I'm sure LHR has a pretty good catering set up. I don't drink Chardonnay or red wine (3 choices) so I had to drink beer instead. This really is unacceptable in Business Class. And why no Canadian wines? The service on both sectors was efficient and friendly so no complaints there. I can't comment on inflight entertainment as I didn't use it. The WC's were shocking. They smelt like a public urinal with wet floor and paper stuck to the floor - and this was 1 hour into the flight. They obviously hadn't been cleaned at the turnaround. The lounge at Calgary is being refurbished so it was crowded and not very comfortable. All the chairs had rips or worn arms so the refurb is well overdue. The flight back was ok I got my wine this time! The toiletries supplied were an unknown brand and not worth bothering with very basic. For the amount of money paid for Business Class they could do better. It's more like Premium Economy except for lie flat beds. If the LHR/Calgary sector had Premium Economy I would have taken it. Next time I will try Canadian Affair (charter) Premium Economy. This was a leisure trip so expense was very important as I was paying! If Economy is well priced on Air Canada it may be worth it but not Business Class.
1288,Return flight to Bangkok. Business Class was something between Premium Economy and real Business Class. Service was fine food okay seats fine though not angled flat.
1289,MUC-POP-MUC in Business Class. Dedicated check-in at Munich. Shared Lounge in Munich was hard to find no food service and a weird collection of magazines. POP-MUC via VRA: Check-in a bit more crowded and less efficient - lounge in POP hard to find due to construction works. Shared Lounge at POP serves non-edible sandwiches and a very limited variety of drinks no magazines or newspapers but free wifi. No Lounge access for transit pax in VRA. Onboard welcome drink service with prosecco and orange juice - prosecco was barely drinkable. Food and Beverages edible and tasty. Cabin crew deliver attentive and friendly service however not very consistent. Seats outdated. Mechanical adjustments only 150 degree recline and oldish IFE. Seat pitch and width were decent. Washroom clean. Amenity kit provided on both legs with usable contents. Kit different on return flight (might have been an economy kit) and seems to have been in storage for an extended time. Good product for the price - saves around EUR 1000 and at least 5 hours vs UA + Jetblue or AA via MIA even though the return trip is somewhat lengthy due to a stop in VRA or MBJ.
1290,My husband and I flew business class last week to Cancun from Toronto and return. We couldn't have asked for more attentive flight attendants good food and emphasis on detail. Was a little hesitant about flying Rouge for the first time after all the bad reviews but sometimes I think the passenger in the seat might be the problem. Congratulations to Air Canada for their creation of Rouge couldn't have asked for a better flight and flight crew.
1291,"Flew back from Paris to Toronto 4 Oct does Air Canada actually have anybody checking ""hand luggage"" an amazing amount hand luggage seen going onboard aircraft. By the time we were boarded all the luggage bins were full of large suitcases. This has happened a number of times now. Tired of struggling to load our small bags and will now try another airline that actually enforces hand baggage size. Would help if Air Canada thought about all customers rather than ignoring an obvious problem."
1292,Visited 8 cities in 15 days and ended with SÃ£o Paulo to Toronto (AC91) which was my only flight on AC. Bit of a bumpy ride with tight seats but the staff and entertainment more than made up for it. Staff made sure we all were totally taken care of offering all drinks food items and water at all hours! They also had to take care of a serious health issue with one of the passengers and ensured the rest of us were well taken care of. Entertainment was great! Could chose own movies and had no glitches! Best staff ever had on any flight! Will be flying AC again!
1293,Bangkok to Vienna ticket for BKK-MUC-VIE was by far the cheapest possible on this route. When we arrived at the airport our flight was delayed by 14 hours but they rebooked us to BKK- TXL-VIE. Departure from BKK one hour late flight above average. A330 not new and seats had terrible seat pitch but it was clean and service was excellent. They even managed to organize a vegetarian meal for my girlfriend (as our meal request was for the original flight via MUC). Plenty of free drinks and snacks. Transfer in TXL bit chaotic had to run to our connecting flight. Boeing 737 had much bigger seat pitch and was newer. Again quite a lot of drinks and snacks for such a short flight. Downside was the lost luggage (forgotten in TXL delivered 7 days later) and no possibility at all to contact Air Berlin to find anything about it.
1294,If you regard Air Berlin as a low cost carrier this is the best you could experience in this segment - planes are clean and pretty new. You get good attention onboard and a snack plus a soda or juice for free. On the ground however the experience is different. They are really overdoing it with baggage weight I find it a sure way to turn a loyal customer - holding the Frequent Flier Card - off by making a big fuss (happened twice) when the baggage weighs 215 kg instead of 20 kg. Terminal at Berlin Tegel Airport lacks seating which becomes pretty inconvenient if a lot of delays occur at the same time. If the price difference is not more than 10-15% to a regular carrier like LH or CX I would probably pay that and choose them instead of Air Berlin.
1295,Frankfurt-Hamburg. Very good for price. Well organised and with tidy plane. Upper end of quality for the budget market.
1296,STN-SZG and MUC-HAJ-STN. Excellent for economy tickets and better than competitors. When the first leg of our return flight was delayed (which would mean we would have missed our connection) we were booked onto a BA direct flight to Heathrow without even having to ask. Will use again in preference to RyanAir EasyJet etc
1297,AC 88036 YYZ to PIT Dash 8. Plane ride was uneventful your standard economy seating. Inflight service - pretzels and a drink (soft drinks and juice free).
1298,Zurich to Berlin. Online check-in easy to navigate. Queued for 10 minutes at the bag drop; ground staff were pleasant. Flight departed within 15 minutes of allocated time. Complimentary newspapers in German and complimentary beverages and snack. The plane was clean and the staff were pretty good. Overall a good flight and excellent value compared with Swiss.
1299,ZRH-DUS-ZRH. Both flights left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. A320 and A319 well maintained crew professional with limited language skills. Despite cabin not too clean on outbound no issues on flight back. Some free drinks and snacks served. With an unbeatable price and a good schedule is definitely well worth flying short hauls in Europe.
1300,STN-HAJ-STN. Their staff are extremely nice decent leg room plane is clean and they are fairly punctual. Last time I flew with them the free food and drink was a snack and drink rather than a sandwich. If flying short haul I would be more than happy to use Air Berlin again.
1301,FKB-HAM-FKB. We didn't expect a lot as our benchmark were the Australian low cost carriers. We were overwhelmed with what we got. On the 1hr flight we had one round of non alcoholic drinks and a snack. At the departure gates each way we could stock up on complimentary newspapers and magazines. There was enough leg room for tall people on FKB-HAM and doable for an hour space on the return. No seat back TV's but cabin mainscreen TV's with flight routing and TV series. The ground staff on either airport were efficient.
1302,Seattle to Toronto on AC542. Nice and relaxed flight just a bit late because of the traffic congestion on the Seattle airport at the time of departure. E190 cabin light and fresh seating way better that on a larger types of aircraft. Flight attendants professional and friendly. Good inflight entertainment a large selection of Canadian movies including documentaries and short ones which is really nice.
1303,CPH-TXL-DUS-ZRH. New and clean aircraft. Snacks served crew were friendly even though we only spoke English. Fares were very cheap when compared to the competition. Only German magazines/newspapers available. Would fly them again if I'm in Europe.
1304,TXL-KRK and then KRK-DUS. I was impressed with this airline - a good web site for discovering their service and making purchases very reasonable pricing meaning that one can piece together a complex itinerary without requiring round-trips to get the best prices. On-time performance for each of the 3 legs I flew baggage appearing promptly after the flights. Onboard experience very similar on the TXL-KRK and KRK-DUS flights - the former was a 737-400 and the latter an A319. Not luxurious but newish interiors and good service.
1305,Dubrovnik - Munich. A320 was full and while it was a short flight of just over an hour it seemed a lot longer as every second passenger seemed to be a screaming child. Maybe have flights where no passengers are under 5 years of age? Let's see which airline is brave enough to introduce such a restriction. After this performance I think next time I will pay a higher fare on the full fare airlines.
1306,Santorini to NUE. Check-in in Santorini took nearly two hours due to computer failures but we landed on time. New A320 FAs abrupt but OK and one of the meals I ordered on the site showed up. IFE was overhead. Pilot liked to point out the sights. All-in-all they deliver on short- haul flights but there's no glamour here.
1307,Montreal YUL to Boston BOS on Air Canada Express CRJ100. Checked in online but still needed to use airport machines to print boarding cards and luggage tags assisted by pleasant AC staff. With this small aircraft you have to leave cabin cases at the door and they are returned to you on landing although there were the usual few passengers who decided this reasonable rule did not apply to them. Announcements in the air virtually inaudible because the FA held the microphone too close to her mouth and then shouted into it - training issue here. Drink and snack served on this short flight. Being a small aircraft it twitches a bit in flight so nervous flyers should be aware. Flight left 10 mins late but still arrived 20 mins early in Boston.
1308,The aircraft itself was clean seats however not very well padded. I'm not a very tall person but in order to sleep I had to lean forward on the tray table; I ended up being repeatedly suffocated by the person in front of me every time she reclined her seat. The entertainment system is okay and they dim the screens during the night to help you sleep. The food was good but it seems you only get the choice of Chicken or Pasta.
1309,Dusseldorf-Miami. I was faced in July with few available seats and high fares using American Airlines and other airlines. However travelling Gatwick to Dusseldork and including an overnight stay my trip to Miami with Air Berlin saved me a fortune and I was very impressed with the Air Berlin service. Two reasonable meals as good as other transatlantic economy offerings with free complimentary wine and liqueuers which is something unheard of with AA. IFE via a shared screen but not a problem. The cabin crew were great. Security checks at Dusseldorf quick. All in all a very pleasant trip and with the bonus of an arrival at Miami 35 minutes early.
1310,ZÃ¼rich-DÃ¼sseldorf-Reykjavik. Excellent airline friendly staff reasonable food. Good aircraft. Return trip on SAS via Oslo was less enjoyable.
1311,The worst long haul airline and I travel a lot but I am doomed and have been for last 15 years as it is the only direct connection between London UK and Halifax Nova Scotia. The price is outrageous the service is generally poor (even in business I don't find it super friendly) and it is the only long haul airline where I have to bring my own food when I fly economy. Also completely inefficient and useless systems if you want to book an end to end flight using different members of Star Alliance for different legs of the flight (if not in the same class). Every time I have to deal with them I have to grit my teeth.
1312,Berlin TXL to Vienna. Check In efficient. I had 21 Kilos but I did not have to pay extra fees. B737-700 seat pitch is very tight but this was only a 1 hour flight. Nice selection of magazines and newspapers. There was bretzel free and coffee/tea/ juice at no extra cost. Air Berlin clearly offers an outstanding product on short haul flight. The problem starts with its long haul destinations - the seat pitch is a big problem. I would use Air Berlin on short haul flights but on long distance flights would look for Asian or Pacific carrier if available.
1313,ZRH-TXL-ZRH. Flight was ??199 incl and much cheaper than Swiss. Online Check-in efficient and was at the gate quite quickly. Air Berlin use the B gates at ZRH which are easy to get to but once you are there you cannot do much as there are only 2-3 shops. Boarding is also by bus which is rather inconvenient. TXL is probably the cutest airport I have seen. It is so tiny and efficient for an airport. The distance between the gate and exit is probably not more than 30m. Flight to TXL was delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft and flight back to ZRH was delayed due to ATC regulations. Inflight service is rather simple with free drinks and a choice of crackers or a chocolate bar. Service to TXL was friendly and efficient but the return flight had a very arrogant male FA on board which spoilt the experience. Air Berlin is not a bad airline in general and they can be compared with other carriers in Europe.
1314,ORY-DUS DH8-400. Comfortable leather seats with generous legroom. Cabin interior clean. Web check-in does not work at ORY - however check-in at the airport hassle-free. Free snack on this 1-hour-flight. Hot/soft drinks and choice between bretzel and muesli. Stewardesses polite but not overly friendly. On the downside not a single word from the cockpit!
1315,AC034 20 September. Just got off a 14 hour flight from Sydney and thought the crew was excellent. They were attentive continued cabin presence and friendly. I also thought the seat (even though a little warn) was better than other airlines like Malaysia Airlines A330. Very pleased with everything and well worth the price. Definitely a 7.5 out of 10.
1316,Toronto - Tel Aviv - Toronto B787 Dreamliner. Executive First. Aircraft is superb and is now my favoured choice over the B777. Innovative numerous improvements in passenger comfort and convenience. Cabin staff really proud of the aircraft and it shows in their service. Flights left on time and arrived early. Concierge at Tel Aviv personally accompanied me to my seat (a first). Overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience on both flights. A thumbs up to a great new aircraft and a motivated and delightful crew.
1317,On 14th Sept flew Air Canada express - Saskatoon to Vancouver on AC Express. Excellent service by flight attendants. The plane is starting to show its age. We then flew AC 47 to Honolulu. Here again the aircraft is showing its age. Our preferred seat 12 A and C has no window. Service was excellent. The flight attendants were older and were very professional. We learned that Air Canada Rouge is taking over this route in Mid Nov. and we will be returning on that flight in Dec. Our flight departed late however arrived in good time. We had problems stowing our carry on bag as bins were completely filled. Flight attendant did put our bag in a bin in Business Class.
1318,LHR to YVR 777-300ER. Fairly new aircraft with everything clean and working as it should. Cabin crew were okay without being anything special. I found the staggered beds to be quite comfortable although if travelling alone it is better to avoid the pairs of seats near the window unless you want to climb over/be climbed over by a stranger. Food was okay but nothing special. Air Canada lounge at Heathrow was nice but the check-in process was poor. The premium desk was far removed from the economy kiosks with poor signage and the Air Canada roving ground staff lady that we dealt with did not help. It was only when we reached the bag drop desk after a long wait that we were told where we should have gone.
1319,"Toronto YYZ - Tel-Aviv TLV. Flew on new 787-8 aircraft in a standard economy window seat. The plane has only been in service since the early summer and it shows. It still looks (and smells) new. The climate control system pumped fresh air into the cabin the AC was very good. The windows on this plane are huge. The ambient lighting changed according to our journey's progress and provided a good general atmosphere. The entertainment system was excellent and fast responding with an extended selection of films TV shows games etc. Every seat came with a USB plug as well as AC power. Flight attendants were courteous professional and between them spoke 6 languages to cater to the various passengers. The overhead storage bins were very large. The cabin in general seemed spacious and pleasing. Before I review the seats and leg space please make note that I have small build 5'5"" (165 cm) and 132 pounds (60kg). Leg room was ok as long as you don't have carry on luggage on the floor. The seat reclined to a relative comfortable position (as far as an economy seat may be comfortable) although I didn't note a major improvement over other/older Air Canada planes including the 767-3 which was replaced by this plane on this route. The big problem with the seating in economy is the 3x3x3 configuration. The seats are narrow. I was lucky that nobody was sitting in the middle seat next to my window seat. The seat felt cramped without a person sitting next to me. It would've been almost unbearable to fly for 10 hours with someone next to me. Remember I'm smaller than the average person and couldn't imagine how an average or large person could last in an economy seat for such a long flight. Air Canada definitely dropped the ball with this seat configuration on an international flight. It might work for a short haul flight but not on a 10 hour flight. Simply outrageous design decision. Another inexplicable design decision was to mount controls on the arm rest exactly where you'd put your arm. There were several incidents witnessed during the flight where a passenger accidentally pressed the flight attendant button. The flight attendants reaction was as if it was a common occurrence. I myself accidentally pressed the seat lighting button a few times and changed the volume on my flight entertainment program. This is a very annoying design flaw especially if a stranger sitting next to you will push the buttons on your flight entertainment controls. Food was horrible possibly the worst meal I've come across specifically the main course for dinner as well as breakfast. One bite was more than enough to leave the food on the tray. The new plane has a lot going for it but is plagued by design flaws in economy that would most likely make the long journey in economy a very bad experience for almost every single person. Disappointing! I cannot recommend a flight on this plane in economy. My suggestion would be to pay the extra money to fly in Premium Economy. The seats looked far more comfortable and had had a better 2x3x2 configuration. I also suggest to eat prior to flying at the airport and/or buy food to eat prior to boarding."
1320,"Flew from Calgary to LHR. Comfortable seat food was good. Plane was clean. Only defect was the inoperative entertainment system. That was no great hassle I had a good book. Boarding was well done. Terminal 2 at Heathrow was hopeless. It took an hour to get through Immigration. Many booths were empty and the fast track computers were ""down"" so the fast trackers cluttered up the ""other passports"" group. Air Canada has some terrible reviews and my son in Calgary warned me of its reputation so I had bought some muesli bars just in case. I was pleasantly surprised the flight was good. I would use them again. Round the world flights seem poor value."
1321,"Vancouver to Honolulu January 9-17 2015. To Honolulu AC1831 5.30 pm on time departure seats 12 D and E (Zone 5): 1) How the new boarding works at YVR airport - when they call out Zone 3 (back of the plane) you must wait about 10 minutes before boarding. My complaint is that none of the gate attendants called out Zone 5. It became a free for all where no one bothered to call out Zones 4-5. Having Prestige status and/or one of the Visa Infinite Privilege credit cards will not bump you into Zone 2 for priority boarding on rouge. 2) Our cabin and cabin seats were clean. My partner is 6'2 and I'm 5'4. We found the seat pitch (35) to be comfortable and the recline to be sufficient enough to enjoy a snooze. I brought my Android kobo reader and downloaded movies/TV shows beforehand and was happy with that. Yes they charge $10 per iPad rental but as stated in previous reviews the connections timeout and any Air Canada app show you watch will intermittently stop and take up to a few minutes to load and continue (as my partner experienced on his iPhone). 3) Flight attendants are attentive and aim to be very pleasant. 4) I ordered cheese cubes with crackers as a light snack from the OnBoard menu. We had visited the Priority lounge prior to for some light snacks. 5) Flight came in to HNL 25 minutes early. We waited 40 minutes for our luggage in the partial open-air airport which still looks the same as it did in the 80s as with most dated American airports. To Vancouver AC1830 01.00am departure (delayed from 11.15pm) seats 12 A and C (Zone 5): 1) If you are a Nexus card holder you get pre-TSA clearance at HNL airport which is handy for moving quickly. This open-air airport is not air-conditioned in the main corridors. Lounges are closed after 6pm. Check before you leave hotel to make sure flight is on time. 2) HNL gates are open only when the incoming flight has landed and completely deplaned. 3) Nothing past Zone 3 is called out. At YVR gate attendants admit that the system is new and they are still figuring out how it works (whether or not to bother calling out Zone 5 at all). 4) By the time we boarded we noticed that the plane was not full. Because the plane arrived late (weather reasons) although the signs said ""delayed to 12.05am"" we didn't take off until after 1am. However we arrived only 20 minutes later than we normally would had the plane left on time. 5) Both directions there are no means to control air and there are no power outlets to charge devices. HNL airport has plug-ins throughout to pre-power up however. 6) Cool air was blasting in our window/aisle seats and we felt it. When we were mid-cabin flying to HNL this wasn't a problem. I'd recommend purchasing a beach towel merely to cover up and keep warm on the plane. We were fully dressed for chillier Vancouver winter weather which helped. Would I fly it again? Yes booking seats 12 D and E or D and F. Why? Good price decent leg room served first with drinks/snacks - they offered twice and in a very timely manner. You de-plane faster. Overhead bulk storage is big enough for two single-day backpacks and more. We always had room for our stuff. The flight attendants were kind."
1322,Travelled from Heathrow to Vancouver we sat for 90 mins on the runway with little info but just problems with one of the engines. The TV did not work and we had to wait for the stewardess to be ready to re boot it! The seats are 3x4x3 and very little leg room although the leather seats were quite comfortable. The worst thing was the rude service we got from the air hostesses they looked like it was too much trouble to do anything for you! The food on return flight was appalling before we landed we were handed a yoghurt and a dry slab of some kind of cake. For the price of the flights I felt the great films did not make up for the bad service poor food and cramped conditions!
1323,Flew YEG-LHR (again). Great experience. It's not the luxury of the middle eastern or Asian airlines but the meals and wines are included unlike Icelandair and the cabin experience is far better than United. My first choice. The LHR terminal they use is now excellent.
1324,AC001 YYZ to NRT. Could not scan the boarding pass to retrieve baggage tag using the machine hence we had to queue up for 'check in assistance'. The line up was long we had to wait for 1hr. Boarding was quite quick. Service was mediocre kind of bad actually when you compare it to ANA (I have a connection to CGK using ANA). Return trip AC006 HND to YYZ. Same service except for better IFE due to newer aircraft (b787). Food was not delicious but edible on both sector. Overall Air Canada is a mediocre airline.
1325,A good flight from London to Toronto - but what miserable female flight attendants - one did not even manage a smile in 7.5 hours. Please Air Canada - staff training on welcoming people to Canada.
1326,London Heathrow to Montreal 28 August 2014 Boeing 777-333ER C-FNNW. One of Air Canada's latest Triple Sevens equipped with their latest interior in economy with black leather seats and a very cramped 3-4-3 configuration. Very narrow seats uncomfortable but just OK for a 6.5 hour flight. The controller for the in-flight entertainment screen is now placed in the arm rest just where you lean your elbows causing lights and cabin call alerts all over the cabin. Little thought has been placed into the design of Air Canada's new economy cabin! Also my light control was turning on the incorrect light (obviously little testing of their systems on a new aircraft). Cabin attendants all old-timers and all very miserable but this is consistent with my experience of AC's transatlantic offering. Food - perhaps it is time they quit the hot food service! Still cannot believe this economy cabin design has actually entered service and other airlines that also employ the 3-4-3 configuration on the Triple are far more comfortable.
1327,"Vancouver-Calgary-Grande Prairie and return Aug 24-27. Unlike recent ghastly experience with AC Rouge - this was all on regular line. Planes were on-time clean and crew were friendly and efficient. Maple Leaf Lounge in Calgary is being re-built but there was plenty of seating and the food and drinks just fine. A highlight on the GP-Calgary (5.00 flt) - a very friendly and funny FA. Two young chaps were using inappropriate language as they boarded and she (young FA with charm and humor and lovely French accent) reminded them of ""language"" around others. We all smiled and they complied and I was impressed with her. Very nice trip on all four legs."
1328,We had booked Air Canada Business Class seats YXY to MCO 17-26 Dec 2014 and were initially disappointed the flight out of Toronto was on Rouge (Premium). We read many reviews majority being negative but were hopeful our trip wouldn't end up as other travelers had. As it turned out we had a very enjoyable flight both directions. Even though there wasn't the customary onboard entertainment the provided iPads worked well though it would have been nice to have had them prior to takeoff for full enjoyment. I would certainly recommend flying Rouge Premium if it is within your budget and are considering a Toronto to Athens flight in the near future.
1329,HKG-YVR. Each time I take Air Canada between Vancouver and some Asian destination I become increasingly frustrated with half of the staff's attitudes. It seems to me that some of these flight attendants tend to get easily frustrated towards Asian passengers. One flight attendant was lecturing me what I should and should not place in the overhead compartment (I really wish I just ignored her). Another major issue I have with the new seat design is the placement of the earphone plug which is located in front of us. It's extremely inconvenient to unplug it in and out all the time when a passenger next to you has to get up. Plus this is also one of the least comfortable economy seats I have sat on.
1330,24 July YWG-YYZ. I was leaving on an early morning flight on July 24 2014 and had a serious fall onto my face just as I was leaving for the airport. I arrived at the Air Canada check-in in pain and shock. I was greeted by the most caring and compassionate ticket agent who immediately called the medics. They got a wheelchair and ice packs for my face and accompanied me through customs after clearing me for travel with the on call doctor. They gave me extra ice packs for the flight to Toronto and the flight attendants gave me a bag of ice to rest my face in and constantly checked back to check my comfort. Empathic and caring flight attendants.
1331,I flew Air Canada from BOS-YYZ on 8/20/14 in economy class. FA's were friendly and the seats were very comfortable. Not that many movie choices but it is a short flight. On the way back there was a problem with my name during boarding (probably because I was an unaccompanied minor) and as an apology I got a free business class upgrade. The food was great and the seats were very nice. I recommend it.
1332,YYZ-YEG Full flight. Overall a great experience from web check in to early departure and early arrival. Great service by friendly cabin crew. Clean plane. Terminal 1 at YYZ easy to use. Air Canada has WestJet beat.
1333,YVR-LHR on the high density 777. Will avoid this aircraft in the future. Seats were filthy when we got on the plane with garbage shoved under the seat and in the pockets. Not acceptable for business class. Service was poor and staff constantly running around frantically. No water runs no one came to collect garbage and there was no snack bar unlike other 777 flights. Food was mediocre at best. One positive about the 777HD is that the IFE is excellent and the TV screen is much larger. If you are seated next to someone consider yourself stuck because it is very difficult to climb over when the seat is reclined.
1334,I have just recently completed 2 return trips YYC-YYZ in Y class after a number of AC rouge flights and have to say I felt like I'd been upgraded. Flights were comfortable entertainment had a great selection right at my seat and I didn't have to download an App to watch 30 yr old movies. Inflight service was good lots of overhead cabin room and the best part - adequate leg room! I am still a fan of AC but really hope they do away with AC rouge asap. It's bringing the AC brand image down to a very low level.
1335,Air Canada Express (Jazz) YYZ - Charlottetown PEI - YYZ August 12-19. Given the strong and well deserved criticism levelled at Air Canada's bizarre Rouge offering I want to compliment those in charge and working in their Express service. Our flights to Charlottetown and back were on time professionally operated with a calm atmosphere completely absent the tension that exists on so many stressful jammed-in flights. The CRJ 705 to PEI was very comfortable you could cross an ocean in those seats no problem. The smaller CRJ 200 on the way back is more snug with a couple of inches less leg room but still adequate for the flight length. The CRJ 200 lacks the entertainment system and catering of the 705 that is the only thing removing some stars from my overall rating. Now that I will not book an Air Canada flight that could be Rouged at a later date it is good to know that there are some services under the Air Canada brand that one can take with a confident expectation of good service and a pleasant flight. Well done Jazz Aviation and AC Express.
1336,AC1872 YUL-MCO on December 6 2014. I was flying in Premium rouge and was curious what the experience would be like given all the reviews. I'm aware that there is a vast discrepancy between Premium rouge and regular rouge service however I would have to say that I was quite pleased with my experience. On this flight the Premium rouge cabin was less than half-full and service was smooth and punctual. All staff were very friendly and ensured that any needs were met. The meal service went well with the standard mainline AC offerings and the food was moist and flavourful. iPads were distributed and while I had my own media with me I opted to try the distributed iPad simply for the experience. The library of films was a bit on the older side but for someone who isn't a cinephile the selection should be sufficient. The video quality was a bit grainy at times given the streaming service but was consistent. The seating arrangement on this A319 in Premium rouge is 3x3 with the middle seats blocked and with pillows seat-belted in where a human would otherwise be. I found the seating arrangement very roomy and to be honest I think that I actually preferred it to the mainline J cabin seating! The legroom was about the same as on the mainline J cabin. I enjoyed having the tray table space of the empty middle seat to put my drink and personal items on instead of putting them on my own tray so as to optimize space. Additionally the under-seat storage of the middle seat allowed easy access and storage for my carry-on bag without having to reach up to the overhead bin and without impeding my own legroom. The colour scheme of the Premium rouge cabin is also quite nice and is a refreshing change from the blue tones of the mainline J cabin. All in all I had a pleasant experience on Air Canada rouge in the Premium rouge cabin however I'm sure my review would be vastly different in the regular rouge cabin given how little legroom there is there (I'm 5'11 so I would be sure to notice it). Thus I would recommend flying rouge so long as you can get a seat in Premium rouge.
1337,We flew LHR-Toronto outbound via Halifax and return via Montreal. Overall experience was positive with genuinely helpful and kind cabin crew on all legs decent IFE selection and all flights arriving on time even after one was delayed so they could find a bigger plane to accommodate a previous cancellation! All the connections were well managed too by calm and well organised staff. The LHR-Halifax flight is clearly not a prestige route and the older 767 along with some rather informal cabin crew and one bordering on 'doddery' did give the feel of something closer to a motorway diner than an international airline but we enjoyed it anyway. Where Air Canada does have big room for improvement is the food. Meals were given on both transatlantic flights but all were decidedly average with breakfast before landing at LHR a single piece of cake! Many have complained about the 3-4-3 seating layout on the new 777-300ERs and yes it is busy boarding and there are sometimes queues for the toilets but I'm 6'2 and even with my long legs it was manageable for 6 hours if not luxurious. Overall we were pleasantly surprised.
1338,LHR to YYZ. We travelled in an old 767. On the inbound flight it was a beautiful big 777 and frankly much better. This 2-3-2 configuration was crowded on a long haul flight and there are only bathrooms in the back of the plane. Our seats at the front - you get it. I do have a few issues with this flight- the bathrooms had not been cleaned and smelt terrible! I think a flight attendant did a good clean up mid flight as it seemed to improve as the flight went on. Surely not appreciated by her. My other issue with Air Canada on both flights is that the cancelled their pre dinner drink run. Cost cutting? Maybe. And the food was pretty lousy too. My children's meals in particular were terrible. Finally our IFE had a glitch and the first 40 rows had their programming interrupted about 20 times. I know first world problems - but when you pay for it. On a brighter note 'some' flight attendants were friendly (others not at all). We will go back to our regular Air Transat route across. Cheaper cleaner and more bang for buck. Friendly too.
1339,Our NRT-YVR flight was quite pleasant. The flight attendants spoke English and Japanese and were friendly and accommodating. They helped with the overhead luggage (something rarely seen with US carriers) and worked hard to help with entertainment and tried to provide service during heavy turbulence. There were at least two choices of dinner both quite nice. Kids got their meals first. Slippers would have been nice (like one gets on Asian airlines). The movie selection was good. Overall an on-time well-handled flight.
1340,A very early flight from SFO to YVR during the holiday crush was made pleasant by an extremely pleasant and helpful team of flight attendants. I travel a lot and this is the first time I have ever felt compelled to praise cabin service. Thanks for making what I expected to be a miserable experience into a very pleasant one.
1341,Full flight YYZ-CUN. Seats are hard and the leg room is laughable but the plane was clean plenty of food options and the flight attendants were courteous prompt and served up plenty of beverages throughout the entire flight. Coming from some atrocious US Airways and United Flights good service and a clean plane makes all the difference. Not as bad as they say and better than some of the other NA carriers.
1342,Flew from Paris to Cayenne on October 2013 in business class. Overall good experience nice lounge in Paris Orly South fast track to go quickly from customs and police. Good seating on board with a 2x2x2 configuration. Not a full flat but a 160 degrees recline seat but very comfortable. Very good food and excellent champagne. But the most interesting is the price: 1600 euros Air France is much more expensive comparing with Air Caraibes.
1343,Flew July from Cayenne French Guiana to Paris in Premium Economy during an overnight 8 hours flight. Food ok seat premium economy standard seat. Very friendly service my wife's IFE was not working crew were nice and asked another passenger if he would move as he was not using the IFE.
1344,LHR-YYZ return. I was on a 3-3-3 configured 777 which was quite comfortable however I would avoid the newly configured 3-4-3 777 as I understand the seat width and pitch is less - I have had experience of this configuration before and it is not comfortable. Food going out was great but terrible coming back - I guess LHR has better catering! Regular drinks runs with a full bar rather than just juice/water was a welcome surprise.
1345,LAS - YVR connecting to YYC and return YYC to LAS non stop. Booked in the Premium Rouge cabin. There are three rows of 3 x 3 however the middle seat is left unoccupied with two oversized red pillows. The catering is identical to Air Canada Business Class with a menu provided with entrÃ©e choices food is served hot and is good quality and sufficient quantity. Service was professionally casual. My only suggestion for a better service experience would be to hand out the iPads sooner to allow for more access. On both flights the iPads were handed out well after take-off and then they are being collected back just after the pilot announces the descent of the aircraft which leaves about 30-45 minutes of time when you could be enjoying some entertainment to pass by the time for those who don't read books or bring their own entertainment equipment.
1346,Travelled from Orly via Pointe-?-Pitre to St Barth. Newish 330 across the Atlantic with comfortable and fresh Business section - nearly flat with large screens. Friendly service with OK meal service. Helpful transfer process in Pointe-?-Pitre and then small plane across to St Barth. Competitive pricing translated into great value.
1347,I flew on TX from ORY to FDF have to admit I was quite impressed. The PA in 3 languages including Creole meal was great with Caribbean touch and 2 options in Eco PTV on board (larger than AF COI very high density) cheaper than other competitors. Colourful friendly cabin crew and on time performance was great. Very professional.
1348,I was really surprised with this flight between Cayenne (French Guiana) and Paris in business class. There is a new business class on the A330-300 angle lie seat with a recline of 160Â° 18 seats with a configuration 2x2x2 outbound 8.5 hrs flight to Paris. Very good staff during this night flight I called to get some water and the attendant was there within 2 minutes. You can really sleep well in this new seat inbound 9 hours flight very good food wine champagne with attentive service - really worth the money. Only 1300 euros for a return ticket.
1349,I travelled premium economy on Air Canada from Vancouver to Heathrow. This product is very good value in my opinion. Seats were similar to AC domestic standard business class about 38' or more pitch two on the sides. The dinner meal was a condensed business class meal in my opinion having travelled in that class previously. The wine drinks service was excellent staff were very attentive. Morning meal more standard fare but fine. Air Canada has come a long way in service over the past few years and I would definitely choose them over any American carrier and many European ones. I thought the dinner meal was better than what I ate on united first class. UA could take lessons from AC.
1350,AC865 LHR-YUL B777-300ER full flight and expectations fulfilled. Great plane seats comfortable for a 7 hrs flight IFE is superb with new touch screens (like ipad) good variety of movies music and series selections food OK pasta was delicious however the wrap snack was nothing special perhaps an ice-cream would have been a better option as we're in summer now. Staff very dedicated and attentive always smiling passing through the cabin quite often for water services and more. Amazingly enough it was my first time on an intercontinental AC flight and I got very satisfied with this experience.
1351,AC869 11th July 2014 London Heathrow - Toronto. LHR-YYZ. Travelled to Toronto business class on new 787 seat was the best I have experienced in a long time good food on offer and great IFE. Only one problem beware of booking seats 5A + 5K on the 787 - these seats don't have any windows.
1352,May 25th Calgary to Winnipeg AC 8380. June 30th Winnipeg to Saskatoon AC 8293. July 13th Saskatoon to Winnipeg AC 8296. July 27th Winnipeg to Toronto AC264. Recently I took four domestic flights with Air Canada. All flights were on time crew did what they supposed to do. Certainly tickets are overpriced but its because there are no competition on Canadian air market. Would certainly consider flying with them again.
1353,AC 613 July 6th from Halifax to Toronto and AC 716 Toronto to NYC (LaGuardia) on July 6th. Ground crew and FA's were both excellent. Aircraft's on both flights (Airbus 320 and E-190) were very clean and well maintained. Cannot find anything to fault. Will fly Air Canada again without question.
1354,"Our son lives in Canada. We have traveled numerous times to Toronto out of Phoenix AZ. We had not heard of AC Rouge until our son booked the flight to Toronto in the latter part of Nov. Then I started looking on the Internet about AC Rouge. We never buy food or drinks nor movies on any plane so no problem there. Flight was good other than the terrible seating i am 5'10 and my knees were touching the seat in front of me then the guy in front of me moved his reclining seat back then it made his seat about 14"" from my face. Such terrible leg room makes it quite an ordeal for anybody going to the restroom."
1355,Flew from Toronto Pearson to Milan Malpensa direct. I must say I have no complaints whatsoever ok the food was average but its airline food so why complain. The whole experience was pleasant.
1356,Mexico City-Toronto-Milan Malpensa round trip in business class. Air Canada delivers a consistent and sound business class product with some features that make it more similar to a first class product. For example the seat configuration on the 767 (1-1-1) is really comfortable and give a great degree of privacy that is not provided on other 4* airlines. Staff service very attentive. I had a 12 hours layover in Toronto and Air Canada provided me a room free of charge at the Gateway Sheraton: a detail that was very much appreciated. I suggest an improvement on drinks in Business Class: for instance an upgrade in whisky and a wider selection would be both very much appropriated.
1357,YVR-PVR-YVR Dec 6-13/14. I would advise you not to travel with Rouge if you are above average size as seating is extremely tight. Since I am of average size and my flights were on time I can hardly fault them. I also got a great deal on this particular flight but this was definitely an anomaly as I see the flights for the same route to PV are now upwards to $1200. I'm ok paying cheap fares for cheap product/service but $1200 for a 5 hour flight is ridiculous in the extreme. I only paid about a 1/3 of that for these particular flights which makes this review ok. BRING your own entertainment. Food is buy on board same as everyone else. I've flown Westjet on this route lots of times and Westjet is no better or worse. They are extremely tight and no cheaper. My advice is know what you are getting into and do not pay/sit in Premium (not worth the extra $$). If the flight is too expensive then vote with your feet. Unfortunately we are a captive audience as Westjet's prices are the same if not higher.
1358,I flew from Toronto to Sydney Australia via Vancouver. The flight was very comfortable. Sure the seat could have been roomier but there was adequate leg room. The leg from Toronto to Vancouver was great no one in the middle seat! And because I was continuing on to Sydney I got free food (a choice of a meal item and a snack). The food on the long haul leg was okay nothing special but edible for myself. Free bar service is nice! Service was good and water was plentiful. I think Air Canada's seat back TV is best in class. Lots to choose from when you can't sleep! The only think I wish Air Canada did differently is get rid of 3x3x3 seating and make it 2x4x2. Yes less seats overall but it would make it a more pleasant flying experience for all!
1359,"We flew from Ottawa to Hong Kong returned from Shanghai to Ottawa both via Vancouver. I paid extra for choice of preferred seats and while there was sufficient legroom the seats were so narrow as to make comfort and ultimately sleep impossible. The food was really nothing more than garbage with a choice of ""gruel"" or a slice of some sort of egg for breakfast. For dinner I chose the beef which was a very poor quality meat all fat and only 3 little pieces. I think next time I will pay more and try to fly with another carrier."
1360,We flew from Toronto to Hong Kong direct. The seats were fine and the flight attendants were friendly but the food was really atrocious. The sum of the meals were carbohydrate heavy. For snacks we were offered pretzels and later some kind of shortbread-like cookie. The snack on the return trip included a roast beef sandwich which had nothing but white bread and roast beef (no lettuce no dressing nothing!). Oh yes one of the other snacks was cup o'noodles. For main meal one of the dishes was some kind of white pasta pellets with a little bit of chicken. Another main meal was white congee (i.e. white rice porridge) or egg. So again carbs carbs carbs! I'm not anti- carb but the meals were all heavily laden with carbs with very little else to go with it. Not even vegetables!
1361,"SYD-PEK-TPE-PVG. A long queue formed 3.5 hours in advance (half an hour before check-in opens). This is a long flight, so arrive early to get a decent seat. The long haul offered two meals. Dinner was edible but breakfast was better. Drinks are free flow and crew are happy to serve water. IFE is channel-based (you don't get to choose the show on demand, rather what is being shown), and it may not interest those who don't know Chinese well. Did not hear the Captain speak for this long stretch, and crew's English announcements can be hard to hear. Flights to and from TPE: Breakfast appeared to be simpler. Captain did give announcement for this stretch. Wifi IFE is available for flights to and from TPE, but Air China specifically bars mobile phones from accessing this system. If you don't have a laptop, you are probably out of luck. Premium economy seats are empty, and are basically the same economy seats on SYD-PEK (channel-based IFE). ATC delayed 1.5 hours both directions. Overall a decent value for money, if you have China on your visit list and don't really mind about the IFE. Be aware of ATC delays if you only plan to transit."
1362,We flew from Frankfurt to Calgary and 3 weeks later again from Vancouver to London. Our first trip was a bit hectic because we had very little time to catch our connecting flight. We had to run to our gate and once arrived there was a big queue. We were assigned 2 seats apart from each other (15 rows in between) so despite the big queue we went to the Air Canada desk at the gate to ask if it was possible to change our seats. The lady was friendly and she did manage to change our seats on this very short notice so that was positive. During the flight the food was good you could choose from different soft drinks (cans not just a glass) and the flight attendants came by with water quite often. The inflight entertainment was good as well (touchscreen). On the returning flight we had a newer airplane but the experience was not as good. The seat configuration was different as they added an extra row of seats which made 3-4-3. Because of this the seats were very small and less comfortable. Also the food was quite bad and the flight attendants were not as friendly and less skilled. The inflight entertainment system however was even better (latest version) so no complaints about that at all. Overall impression of flying with Air Canada was good. Would we choose for Air Canada again? Probably yes.
1363,"Check in was smooth and no big queues. Boarding smooth, flight took off and landed on time. Seats and aircraft clean and neat. Quiet a new aircraft. TV screens for each seat with a some choice of English and Chinese/Japanese Lagrangian movies. All seats with blankets and head sets. Food predominantly Chinese and Japanese (understandably), Soft drinks beer and Alcohol served before meal. Toilets were clean. The onboard duty free was decent and well conducted. Typically, Chinese returning passengers, carry a lot of hand baggage. Great flight for the price compared to ANA/JAL. We were so apprehensive before booking online (reading many negative reviews). I strongly recommend Air China for this sector."
1364,YYZ-LHR-YYZ. Outbound flight on new 787. Return on 777-300. The new planes are a very welcome addition and a solid improvement over the dated 767. AC has reconfigured the business class pods for the 787 so they point towards the window instead of away. TV screens are much larger table trays are better located and there are actually places to put your belongings (not so for the 777). Very tough to find any fault. They just need more of them sooner. Service was better than usual (AC can be very inconsistent). Food quality was poor for business class. IFE is getting better but still needs investment. AC's switch from T3 to T2 is a good move as the terminal is much nicer and easier to get through security although the walk to the Heathrow Express is a long one.
1365,LHR to YUL on Boeing 777. Following a somewhat chaotic boarding process driven by the awkward queuing arrangement at the new Terminal #2 boarded the plane only to sit on board for nearly 50 minutes awaiting ATC clearance for takeoff. Once in the air the service was prompt with very attentive FA's. Meal and drink selections were good but the main course I chose lacked flavour. Good inflight AVOD with decent selection of movies and entertainment. Pre-arrival snack was mediocre at best. Despite a late departure the crew was able to make up most of the lost time achieving an almost on schedule arrival. Overall it was a pleasant experience but I must say the new staggered seat configuration in business class is a significant downgrade from the pods. Seat controls are in the arm rest resulting in frequent accidental activation. In lie-flat position one's feet have to fit into a very small space which is very uncomfortable. Swiss utilizes the same seats but provides more leg/foot room. The table is difficult to operate and even the FA's struggle with it. I have been a top-tier loyal customer of AC but if they choose to convert all of their long-haul business class to this seating configuration I will look for alternatives in a hurry.
1366,Vancouver to Victoria on 16 June 2014 a 20-minute flight aboard a Dash8-300 connecting from Lufthansa. As I was leaving the Vancouver immigration and customs hall personnel of the Canadian Border Services Agency directed me to the wrong exit. Hence instead of going through a dedicated security line for passengers connecting to domestic flights I found myself in the main airport arrivals area bringing all my checked baggage with me even though it was tagged to Victoria my final destination. I asked an AC staff member driving an electric cart whether there was somewhere to drop my checked baggage or whether I should head for the domestic check-in queues. The airport wasn't busy she confirmed that my baggage was already tagged to my final destination and she had no passengers in her cart; so she took me directly to a separate counter (with its own conveyor belt) used for wheelchair passengers accepted my already-checked bag and issued my boarding card. Excellent treatment by Air Canada staff. (As it was a 20-minute flight it had no food or entertainment.)
1367,"Usually I fly Etihad for Geneva - Chengdu route, therefore I can't help but comparing the 2 airlines. Both are national carrier of their respective countries, however, the difference is obvious. I just want to mention some main points: 1) The crews are not really warm nor patient, which happens to almost all Air China flights I have taken. I am not sure whether it's because majority of the passengers are Chinese. I am not going comment on the behavior of the passengers themselves, as a service provider, the least you have to do is smile and be courteous. On the other hand, I can't say all Etihad crews are excellent, but I have encountered some who are really sincere and hospitable. 2) The entertainment system is really outdated, the control is not sensible any more and the movies are really lame. On the contrary, Etihad has a great selection of movies and easy to use system. Besides, it has considerably provided each passenger a small pouch with an eye mask, a toothbrush with toothpaste, a pair of ear plugs plus a pair of socks. I suggest Air China to have more trainings on the attitude of their cabin crews and how to provide exceptional customer service."
1368,Flew a short flight YYZ to YOW on 29 June in ERJ190. More room both width and legroom than on the BA 787 that I flew on from LHR. Attentive crew. Minimal snacks but then it was less than an hour. Would fly again on the 190.
1369,Victoria to Vancouver 4 June 2014 a 20-minute flight aboard a new Dash8-Q400 connecting to Lufthansa. The Dash8 series has never been able to accommodate a full-sized carry-on bag in the passenger cabin either in the overhead bin or under the seat in front. As a solution AC has accepted full-sized carry-on bags aboard the Dash8-100 - 200 and -300 models by having passengers place their bags on a cart beside the airstairs when boarding placed them in the baggage compartment as the last bags by the compartment door and then put those bags on another cart at the foot of the airstairs for passengers to collect upon arrival. With its new Dash8-Q400s Air Canada cannot do this but it only announced that fact at the gate at Victoria telling passengers that their full-sized carry- ons would be taken only as checked baggage to their final destination. Passengers were forced to take out from their carry-ons all the items essential to keep with them during their entire trip (laptops prescription medications anything breakable or valuable). My own carry-on is only two-thirds the standard full size and (just barely) fits under the seat in front so I was able to keep it in my possession for my entire 16-hour journey. Travellers should avoid AC flights served by Dash8-Q400 aircraft unless they use smaller carry-on bags not the standard full-sized ones. (As it was a 20-minute flight it offered no food or entertainment.)
1370,LHR to Toronto. Although I had originally seen a suitable flight schedule with Air Canada my travel agent organised for me to fly with Lufthansa as she said they were a more reputable airline. Turned out it was code share with Air Canada meaning no access to meal choice no seat selection and subsequently general anxiety about the booking. I got to the airport 3 hours before each time. At Heathrow I was patronised at the counter with 'everyone knows that showing up early does nothing anymore'. I was given a seat in the last row of the plane that only reclined slightly. No problem I am an experienced traveller and although I was on the way to give one of the most important presentations of my life I was able to relax and keep calm. At Toronto airport checking in for the Heathrow flight I had to queue a very long time and then was told there was no assigned seat for me. I went to Lufthansa to see if there was anything they could do for me. I asked why I could not check in online. They told me because the code was a Lufthansa code not recognised by Air Canada. They then told me that because I had bought a significantly cheaper fare (I hadn't) that I should expect to be treated like this. I did however notice that my class was Y which is usually on my boarding pass when I travel economy. Finally 30 minutes before the flight they called my name and had assigned my seat in the last row of the aircraft where I could not recline. This was the overnight flight from Toronto to Heathrow and I had to go back to work the next day. I was offered a choice of two meat based meals and had to refuse them as I am vegetarian. No seat choice no meal choice. My advice is to give code share a miss. Lufthansa and Air Canada may well be partners but when you travel Air Canada as a Lufthansa customer you are bottom rung nobody who somehow deserves to be patronised by all.
1371,Flew from Vancouver to Toronto in business class on a brand new 777-300. It had the brand new business class and it was excellent. Great staggered layout and single seats are amazing for sole travellers. Very comfortable in lie flat position and new duvet and pillows great quality. Excellent meal service and lovely staff. Would love to fly on this again.
1372,"First class in quiet cabin, only 2 of 8 seats occupied. Nice suite type of seat and very nice for sleeping. Give you a nice duvet, but seat does not have a mattress and seat cushions a bit worn. Food is okay, seems to be the same menu year in and year out, and Chinese options are better than the western menu that I chose. Staff were friendly enough, and reasonable language skills in speaking English. Of course not up to the levels of Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific, but if you can get a cheapish ticket its not bad. Inflight entertainment is terrible - very limited western choices and system very slow and not responsive."
1373,"I had 3 trips on Air China, from Beijing to Xi'an and Harbin to Beijing. Both flights were excellent, comfortable seats, good service and clean. I had 3 flights on China Eastern in the same time. By comparison Air China flights were better in every measure. They transport the first class passengers from the plane to the luggage area - this is a nice feature. The Air China lounges are far superior."
1374,Air Canada used the CRJ705 for this quick 80 min trip from Ottawa to Halifax. And you know what? The first class configuration of 1-2 is perfect. Nearly feels like a private jet! Nearly. Was also surprised that we got full meal service. Well done AC.
1375,"We flew LHR-HND via PEK, and then returned from NRT to LHR with a 72 hour transit visa stop in PEK. Despite the many negative reviews about Air China economy class, the fare was too good to travel with another airline. Overall, the experience wasn't too bad. We booked via an online travel agent, so were unable to select our seats online, but it wasn't a problem to contact the Air China customer service team and have our seat selections noted. The seat pitch was the same as most other economy class flights, although the foot rest on each seat was made for smaller people so it restricted leg room when raised. The crew didn't speak much English, but they knew enough to get by, and the in flight announcements were understandable. The inflight entertainment selection didn't have a lot of English language options, and was very limited overall when compared with airlines like Emirates. The food wasn't great, and the only wine available was a choice of red or white Great Wall Chinese wine, neither of which were nice. Overall, I'd fly Air China again if I wanted to travel to or via Beijing, but probably not again otherwise."
1376,The seats and leg room was serviceable. The only thing about the staff that was a concern was most of them spoke basic English. The entertainment also was very biased. For a 13 hour flight their content generally catered only to Chinese people. Luckily I spent most of that time sleeping so it didn't matter. The meal options were limited but the food wasn't bad. The only think I will warn is that if you're on a long flight and you don't like Chinese food don't take this flight because that's what you'll be served throughout the entirety of the flight. Chinese food is okay to me but it did get tiresome eating just that. Everything was clean the seats came with clean pillows and blankets and the plane was at room temperature which is always good since some planes can get cold.
1377,Air Canada used a small and (24yr) old A319 on this Vancouver to Ottawa route. The first class seats are wide however with not much legroom so you feel a bit squashed on this 4+ hour flight. The IFE kept breaking down so they had to reboot several times during the flight. The service though was good and they had a really great healthy breakfast option that I really enjoyed.
1378,Travelled AC 001-002 YYZ-NRT B777-300. Two class layout with the classic pods herringbone layout. Always love these layouts. Flew round trip June 5-11. Everything was excellent. Always impressed by AC service. Went to bed as soon as we took off and opted for the dine on demand service instead of the regular meal service. Crew made sure everything stayed warm until I was ready to eat. The food was great for 35000ft up. Bar service always great never have to worry about not having anything to drink. Usual breakfast before landing was so so. Only recommendation would be to time the meals for the time of day. We landed at 5PM continental breakfast at 3pm isn't exactly exciting but its better than nothing. Crew were fantastic always attentive asking if they could you anything else. Seats super comfy. Air Canada just introduced a new duvet and pillow with the launch of the 787 and they are super comfy. All in all great product.
1379,While the service is similar to a regular Business Class flight on Air Canada the seating is in no way business or premium. The seats are narrow with limited leg room - there is no arm rest or power outlets. The large pillows you receive take up the centre seat as a business traveler if I pay more and I expect more from Air Canada.
1380,YYZ-NRT on 77W (2-class i.e. older) AC2 on 15 June. Return leg from earlier NRT-YYZ flight on 31 May. Again another full flight so I couldn't change my seat in the rear. Thankfully for good weather in Toronto that day the flight actually departed early and landed more than 30 minutes earlier at NRT! Staff service was pleasant. Food was again above expectations: the chicken with couscous was great! Unfortunately the plane that day was out of potable water (only bottled water) hence no hot beverages or cup noodles could be served - disappointment. Thankfully in-flight entertainment was better than on NRT-YYZ: volume or sound system was still not reliable - conversation too soft but background music too loud. But the variety of movies was good managed to catch up on old movies that I've been wanting to watch but missed. Kudos also to a particular flight attendant (should have gotten her name she was also serving us on my NRT-YYZ leg) who provided me with Tylenol for my headache when I asked her at the end of my flight. By and large a good flight besides minor quibbles. I sure hope they keep up the good work.
1381,Economy flight April 15 from Chengdu to Beijing (CTU-PEK). Flight was on time fully booked up. I was the only western guy. Chinese pax loaded with tons of bags and suitcases (never heard of checking it in??!!) terrible chaos to find a place for all this bags bags scattered all of the plane in the overhead compartment. No way for this on a western airline. Seat legroom small seating comfort a little bit better than on the outgoing flight. Dinner was served (rice with chicken some sort of cake) and 2 times beverages (coffee tea water juices). Wasn't that bad. Standard behavior of flight attendants. Nevertheless I will never fly economy on a Chinese domestic flight again.
1382,Flew Business Class from PEK-KIX. Flight was delayed several hours because of weather. Flight crew were attentive friendly and kept us updated on the progress. Supper was excellent and consisted of three options: chicken fish or pork that was served on the ground because of the delay. The only complaint was the lack of AVOD especially on this route which is not a short flight.
1383,NRT-YYZ on 77W (2-class i.e. older) AC2 on 31 May. It was a full flight I wanted to change my seat from the rear but I couldn't. Thought that AC deserved a little more credit amidst all the negative reviews on Skytrax which did scare me a little. I guess in general where delays or problems don't occur AC probably performs fine. Staff service was pleasant (occasionally a little less friendly). Food was surprisingly better than I expected: food looked and tasted decent (maybe it's catering from NRT) we were rather well-fed (2 meals + instant noodles) drink runs conducted regularly. Seat comfort was alright: standard fare comparable to other airlines cant really complain especially when their new 77W product seems so much worse. Quibbles arise from the in-flight entertainment: mine worked fine but the volume or sound system was not good - volume was at maximum but sound was still terribly muffled (I could only hear half of the conversation while watching movies making movies with heavy narration un-watchable). Other quibbles include the (at least 20 minutes) delays on departure and the very shaky ride we had due to turbulence - I suspect my seated at the rear of the plane meant more shaking. Overall I guess there has to be a reason why they're a Skytrax 4-star airline and winner of Best Airline in North America for 4 years in a row? I sure hope my return journey YYZ-NRT remains like this or better.
1384,YYZ-MCO return. Service and food were up to mainline AC business class standards however the seats were regular Rouge but with a much better seat pitch. Since they do not sell the middle seat I see no reason why they could not go the extra mile and have wider seats. All the privileges of AC Business class: free checked bags priority boarding Maple Leaf Lounge access priority security at MCO all made it worth the extra cost which was not too excessive. Not particularly impressed with the iPad entertainment system but it worked and there was a reasonable choice of things to watch. This is by far the only way to survive Rouge. I looked back to the cheap seats and it looked awful: an impression confirmed by some who traveled back there. Not up to AC Business Class mainly due to the poor seating but acceptable for a relatively short flight.
1385,Shanghai-Guangzhou on Airbus A330-300. Just an OK airline the worst Star Alliance member I have flown so far though. Flight was packed and left on-time. No entertainment for Economy passengers on this 2 hours flight. A box with a piece of bread some inedible salad and a small portion of fresh fruit salad was served. Two runs of beverages (water spirits tea coffee) is provided to passengers. Cabin crew is OK and does speak good English. Newspaper also distributed but in Chinese only. Air China/Star Alliance Gold lounge at Shanghai Hongqiao International is terrible: very small and Chinese food only is available.
1386,LHR-PEK r/t in First Class. Used miles for this trip as CA First was 75000 vs 100000 for VS Upper Class to PVG. Overall it was OK. As a Star Alliance carrier we used United First lounge at LHR T2. 777 was clean/new bed and pyjamas comfortable amenity kit akin to US carriers' international Business class. Food was pretty average (JAL economy on subsequent flight was better tasting) wine list ok but limited whisky etc. I avoided the instant coffee. Cabin nice and quiet only 4 pax in First both ways. Glad we weren't in fully-crammed Business class. Staff on LHR-PEK were decent but hard to get a smile return from PEK-LHR food was much better and FAs much friendlier. As others have noted IFE is on-demand but somewhat limited English options. I know it's Air China but they should take a page from other Asian airlines e.g. JAL who have tons of international film/TV options. First Class lounge in Beijing is pretty poor: self-serve bar but no ice or lemon etc so don't even bother trying to make a gin & tonic just pour yourself a glass of warm white Chinese wine and whimper in a corner. Beijing Capital Airport is a beautiful Norman Foster building but don't ever transit internationally in Beijing. Unlike pretty much every airport on Earth you have to go through Chinese immigration just for connecting flights (it's a separate queue but still). We had a full two hour connection and spent nearly 1h45m just waiting to get the passport stamp to then go straight back through security. Incredibly inefficient and infuriating. No special/fast track for First class and no staff seemed to care that the delays were making everyone miss their long-haul connections. On balance CA First is slightly better than BA Club but below VS Upper Class. However for 25k fewer miles than VS to Asia it felt like a fair trade. I certainly wouldn't pay cash for the privilege though.
1387,Flew Zurich ZRH to Toronto YYZ on new 787 Dreamliner. Good air quality and I felt noticeably great after the flight. Flight arrived in Toronto 1/2 hour early. The food was nothing special for economy but what can one expect. Staff were friendlier than usual but still in their no-nonsense manner. Seats are not wide but comfortable. They have a problem with the position of the controls on the armrest just by putting your hand on the rest activates the staff call button. Was disappointed about the movie selection just a few blockbusters.
1388,Travelled Copenhagen - Toronto on May 30 2014 and return on June 7 2014. Overall one of the best transatlantic flights I've experienced in economy class. The entertainment system is top of the class. Large clear screen and a lot of brand new movies to choose from. Of course you should bring your own favourite headset for an optimized experience. Food was excellent on the outbound flight and mediocre on the return. Seating pitch as good as it gets on economy.
1389,My return flight CAN-PEK on April 2 was in First Class (business class seats) on board of a A330-200 that in my opinion it has a much better appearance overall. Seats were flat bed with amazing great service and options of food between Western and Asian food. I had the Lamb that was quite good they had Pepsi Max (I do prefer Coke Zero) good white wine the crew was always around looking that everything was fine covering your legs with the blanket and helping to put the sleepers before taking off. The crew has very good English on First Class and they are very friendly and professional. It was a good experience.
1390,I was a little concerned about flying with Air Canada after reading some of the negative reviews on here but I should never have been. I flew on flight AC851 on the 18 May 2014 and I have to say the cabin crew on this flight were absolutely great they were helpful friendly and cheerful in their work and nothing was too much trouble. They made our flight enjoyable! Food was good for an airline seat comfort was good and although there were some delays before take off this was due to Heathrow ground staff and no fault of Air Canada.
1391,Very surprised wrote a negative review just a few months ago. Took same flight in November and it has changed very much for the better. New aircraft 767 great leg room (was my biggest beef in first review) very comfortable flight. Crew were professional plane was on time and the plane was in GREAT shape. They honoured seat selection and made check in easy. We enjoy going to Cancun a few times each winter and I am glad they changed the leg room for better.
1392,London to Montreal on Air Canada's new high density 452 seat 777-300ER. Check in was quick and boarding was a bit chaotic give huge number of passengers waiting in relatively small gate but priority boarding for business class was OK. Business class seating is new 4 and 6 across in alternating rows. Some seats much better than others so one has to choose carefully. Mine wasn't great with thin armrest on aisle side and was constantly bumped by crew and passengers. Overall business class ambience not great and the cabin felt very cramped given relatively high density of seating. Very large TV screens and good sound reduction earphones. Seats not as good as LH UA BA or pods on AC's older 777's and 767's. Service good by professional crew. Food and wine OK and decent portions and frequent drink rounds. Arrival in Montreal efficient and relatively quick baggage claim. Overall not as good as recent UA and LH transatlantic flights but generally OK.
1393,LHR-PEK-Tokyo RT in Business. One-word comment: Impressed. More: A330 on the long legs; 777 to Narita then A321 from Haneda to PEK. All flights on time; all aircraft clean and comfortable. A330 lie-flat seat up there in the business comfort stakes. Not Emirates but better than BA. Food acceptable if (for a westerner) a little idiosyncratic in the order of service. Decent wines - no whisky onboard the return from PEK to LHR. Instant coffee! IFE is probably good if you're Chinese! Very limited choice for English speaker.
1394,NRT-YYZ in Boeing 777-300ER. IFE feeling old. Needed a full-plane re-boot in order for it to work although some units still failed to work. Friendly service. Decent food although portions were small. Seat was okay.
1395,AC085 Tel Aviv to Toronto on May 22nd. Plane arrived 20 mins late and was the same leaving. The food was acceptable the flight crew were good and friendly. The entertainment was good and it was a smooth flight arriving 30 mins late. The old 767's are looking a little tired and ready for replacement.
1396,"Flew long-haul SGN-PEK-LAX. Services were adequate considering the prices I paid. Leg room was better on 737-800 (SGN-PEK) compared with 737-700 (which I flew in 2007 SGN-PEK-SGN). Food portion was a bit small. Drinks service was good. Connecting at PEK took time. They should have opened one or two more counters. Two hours were just right enough to complete the transfer formality. Seat pitch on their 777-300ER was decent could stretch and sleep well. Food portions were small and a bit salty (for me). Drinks services were good during the course of the flights; we could also ""help ourselves"" at the galley. Overall you get what you pay for. A lot of people comparing CA with some other airlines but they forget how much they pay for each of the airline they mention."
1397,Toronto to Victoria on 22nd May. Flight left on time had a problem with the in flight entertainment system but not a big issue. Arrived on time and the cabin crew were extremely friendly. A pleasant flight on an Airbus 320.
1398,We have flying Ottawa to Calgary for the past 2 years. I have always been able to book my seats in advance cost free. Now we have to pay $31 per seat to do this. We are retired grandparents and we save to be able to go and visit our grandchildren as they are very young. This is another financial burden making it more and more difficult to visit family. Greed is so ugly.
1399,Dublin to Toronto return. Okay the seats aren't the most comfortable in the world too thin and seem to lean slightly too far forward but otherwise I had no issues and my back survived both ways. There is less space overall on the plane compared to other transatlantic flights but I was still able to get up and walk around. I was aware before hand that you needed an iPad to watch the inflight entertainment so I had books etc with me instead. The food is the best airline food I've had on any flight. The staff were pleasant and polite and in dealing with one passenger with special needs on the return flight were the best I've seen on any airline. I would fly with them again. In addition unlike certain airlines - the staff were up and down the aisles frequently with extra water for passengers.
1400,I have been doing a lot of travel with this airline in 2013/14 and now 15 within Asia between Beijing Ulaanbaatar Singapore Bangkok and Ho Chi Min. My experience has been very positive. Lots of room planes in good condition friendly staff. Their Economy Class is one of the best. I have used this airline for international trips between Beijing Vancouver and San Francisco in all classes. A totally different experience.
1401,HKG-YVR Boeing 777-300 New configuration. A nightmare that even embarrasses the flight crew to apologise for it. I am a 100K Aeroplan member and this dreadful experience led me to avoid Air Canada since. With other airlines upgrading their already superior products one is left to wonder why Air Canada has chosen to downgrade theirs. I can only imagine the plight in economy where an extra seat has been jammed into each row. On a positive note I have discovered the advantages offered by the competition - of which there is plenty. There may be a short term increase in yields as passengers are crammed into airplanes but the damage to long standing customer loyalty will sadly endure.
1402,YYZ-YVR-YYZ this past week enjoyable flights both ways. I am finding myself flying a lot on the 777. The leg room on this plane is great. On my return flight yesterday the airline had to make a last minute aircraft change and we flew home on the 767. This change was handled in a very professional manner. The counter employees were quick to re-assign seats and tried their best to accommodate every ones request. I have flown Air Canada twice in the last 2 months and have had an enjoyable experience both times. People need to realize that we are no longer in the Wardair days and that Air Canada is doing the best they can.
1403,YYC-FRA and back on the two-class 9-abreast 777-300ER. The seat was as comfortable as I've ever had in economy with sufficient legroom for me even in a standard row. Service was hit-or-miss. On the way over we had a very friendly cheerful crew but on the way back the flight attendants were very snappy and unbelievably inconsiderate to passengers that didn't speak English or French. The food was mediocre compared to the meals I got on the connecting FRA-MAD leg on Lufthansa which is sort of disappointing for a 9-hour flight versus a 2 hour flight. The selection of wine was worse than Iberia Regional offered on MAD-GRX no less. It's not a huge deal to me I didn't expect to eat and drink like a king but when you look at what other airlines are offering I can't help but feel embarrassed for my national airline. The IFE system was decent with a good variety of TV shows and movies. Unfortunately the in-flight map didn't work on the return segment but that's a very minor complaint. Overall I was fairly pleased with the experience compared to my previous experience with Air Canada within North America.
1404,LHR-PEK 2 day stop over PEK-REP and REP-PEK-LHR on the return. Easy to check in at all times and points in my journey. Easy international transfer at PEK on the way back people jump the queue but that happens whichever airline - that's the airports fault. Faultless flights really. The staff aren't overly friendly but then I refuse to fly BA because of their staff. The food was a bit grim but find me an airline where it isn't. The inflight entertainment on the PEK-LHR route was ok (there was no entertainment on the PEK-REP section). The only thing that really annoyed me is that you can't have your phone on even in airplane mode. This seems a little old fashioned. I paid less than Â£600 for my flights so I'm not complaining. Get what you pay for.
1405,Oct 19 - Toronto-Dublin Flight 1908. Oct 31 - Dublin-Toronto - Flight 1909. Outbound flight was not very pleasant staff didn't seem to care. Food was terrible. Terminal One not user-friendly i.e. very little staff presence to assist with machines and gate direction. Was sent all around the terminal to another security checkpoint - by most unfriendly personnel who were quite impatient. Shops are very high end and expensive. Range from a glorified newsagent to Gucci and Victoria Secret shops. Other terminals have good quality T-shirts sweat shirts souvenirs etc. at reasonable prices. I paid $15 for a small glass of wine. Absolutely ridiculous! Inbound flight was entirely different. Staff was very friendly helpful and cheerful. Food wasn't too bad - but not the greatest. Noticed flight attendants were more on the ball and seemed to enjoy their work. An opportunity for In Flight Duty Free Shopping would have been nice.
1406,Flew SYD-PEK-LHR 25/12/2014 and returned LHR-PEK-SYD 15/1/2015. Great flights comfortable seats pleasant staff and ample enjoyable meals. I happened upon cheap flights for the festive period so was not expecting too much especially after reading negative reviews. How wrong I was to presume. The return flight was much fuller than the outward flight however on both legs boarding and feedings were performed with a minimum of fuss. Longest wait was for an over packed young couple at Heathrow followed by a wait time for take off at Beijing. Hardly anything to complain about. Will most definitely be recommending to friends and looking at their website for flights in future. Breaking the Sydney to London journey at Beijing is just about 1/2 way - a great plan.
1407,ZRH-YYZ on an A330. Pros: Seat was very comfortable in terms of cushion width and leg room (though I understand the seats tend to be a bit larger on the A330 than other AC aircraft). Flight was on time aircraft was clean FAs were friendly enough. Cons: Food was downright awful - main meal was very dry pasta with red sauce snack before landing was a completely flavorless chicken wrap. IFE had decent selection but played a 2-minute run of advertisements before playing each selection. Comes across as very tacky. Overall a fairly average long-haul economy flight.
1408,I recently travelled with Air China over the Christmas period from London Heathrow to Sydney via Beijing and back again a couple of weeks later. The flights were around Â£600 cheaper than I could find with any other airline so I took a chance with them. I couldn't seem to check-in online prior to my flight but check-in at the airport and boarding all went smoothly. The planes were clean and comfortable enough and the flight attendants regularly offered drinks including beer and wine. Although there was not a huge range there were a few decent films and TV shows to choose from for the in-flight entertainment. I had downloaded plenty of programmes to watch on my iPad anyway and I'm pleased I did. The flight attendants were polite and helpful. There was a bit of a language barrier but their English was good enough to get by without much difficulty. The food was a bit hit and miss (some of it I couldn't eat and I'm not usually a fussy eater) so I'd suggest taking some snacks. Overall though I was very happy considering the cost of the flights and would definitely travel with Air China again if I was making a similar trip.
1409,YYZ-LHR was rebooked by BA on to this flight as their flight was cancelled due to a bird strike. Check-in very straightforward. Used the Maple Leaf lounge in Terminal 1 close to the E gates. Spacious comfortable lounge but no hot options for breakfast apart from a very sticky oatmeal porridge. Flight was on a B767 with a herring bone 1-1-1 configuration. It felt both spacious and private. The crew were engaging and very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast omelette was rather nice. IFE of a good quality but using the headphones was fiddly because you had to put on the sponge ear covers yourself! Seats are lie flat and quite comfortable-managed a nap of a couple of hours. The serving of lunch was delayed by some turbulence over the Atlantic. The Captain was very reassuring especially as he asked the FAs to be seated as well for about 30 mins. Good choice of champagne and 2 whites and 3 reds. There was a choice of 3 mains-all looked tasty. Arrival was shambolic because of the immigration computer glitch-baggage was waiting when I got to the carousel. Generally very impressed with my first experience of AC Executive Class.
1410,We took two fights one from Calgary to Frankfurt and one from Heathrow back to Calgary. Both flights were fantastic. Staff at check-in and onboard were friendly and courteous. We had many choices for meals black cod and a fatty cut of lamb were not prepared to our taste. The beef and the pasta were much tastier dishes. Thankfully fresh salad/balsamic dressing has been part of the business meal for a few years. Tasty desserts/cheese plates ensure that no one will starve. The pods are a comfortable way to travel and we always manage to have 4-5 hours of sleep. There's ample storage for shoes iPads etc plus a big bin overhead. There was a large selection of old and new movies to watch. The kit with travel amenities is fantastic on the way to Europe but of poor quality on the way back.
1411,Flew SYD-YVR business class on 777-200. The seat configuration is not great for couples my husband and I sat in the middle two seats and were divided by a partition and the angle of the seats meant that to speak to each other we both had to turn sideways and backwards. I could eyeball the person across the aisle more easily but the distance was such you couldn't have a quiet conversation thus still not satisfactory when traveling with someone. Not a lot of room to place personal items in easy reach during the flight. Service was excellent there was plenty of courteous and helpful staff. Food was nice 4 choices of main course I enjoyed my fish also the entree prawn salad. I have to agree with previous reviewer the head phones disposable foam ear pieces were very tricky to stretch over the phones easily torn and easily lost when taking the head phones off. Flat bed was good but I didn't sleep well sinuses didn't cope well with the aircon. Would use Air Canada again.
1412,Dublin to Toronto. I found the flight fine. There are two problems with this airline lack of leg room and the lack of seat back screens. As I'm not that tall the lack of leg room didn't bother me but can see a problem if you are. I downloaded the app onto my ipad. The films were outdated so wouldn't bother with that. The staff were friendly and professional. The food was nice for airline food. Overall I enjoyed my flight.
1413,Flew Dublin to Toronto return - flights very busy but despite that check-in and crew were calm polite and efficient both ways. Space is no worse than many other airlines and food also comparable. The iPad system worked well - and gives better control / screen than many other seat back systems. My only complaint would be other passengers being late to the gate with large pieces of hand luggage!
1414,I arrived at LGA 3 hours before my flight and from check in to boarding-all went smoothly. My original flight was AC729 at 1530 H I didn't want to lounge in the airport on a rainy day so the PSA allowed me to take earlier flight (AC7423) to avoid long wait in the airport. The ground crew and the entire flight crew were very nice.
1415,PVG-LHW first class A320. I didn't expect too much on the domestic first class service on Air China but I was very much surprised! My flight was in the morning and the western-style breakfast was definitely of high international standard. Flight attendant was attentive but did not smile very often. The inflight entertainment system was just a small screen hung above but there were other 10 music channels available so that wasn't really bad on a domestic flight. I would definitely fly Air China on their domestic first class at least out of PVG.
1416,Flight 165 from Montreal to Calgary. The crew were impeccably dressed which can make or break a first impression. I was seated in the economy cabin directly behind business class and was expecting a standard North American carrier style of service but instead received more. The business class flight attendant was sure to make sure my drinks were always topped up and even went as far as to refer to me by name a very pleasant surprise in economy. The flight crew were friendly and present throughout the entire flight. Multiple water runs occurred. Legroom was generous in the bulkhead row and the cabin was clean and fresh. The inflight entertainment system was also up to date with multiple options for programming. I will certainly fly Air Canada again.
1417,Flight 982 NY to Beijing Oct 5th. Flight 4118 Beijing to Chengdu Oct 5th. Return Flight 1426 Chengdu to Beijing Oct 18th. Flight 989 Beijing to NY Oct 19th. 2nd time I have used Air China. Considering the length of the flight NY to PEK  it was comfortable and staff was very friendly. Plane was clean and food was quite good.
1418,AC855 on 4th November 2013 from YVR to Heathrow London. I returned on AC854 27th November 2013. Breakfast as the last meal on the plane was a real come-down. It should leave passengers with a satisfied feeling glad they chose Air Canada for their journey. Instead a piece of cellophane-covered yellow cloggy sponge slice that tasted of nothing paired with a small sweetened yoghourt. It was such a sad and disappointing closure to my trip. Regarding the holding pattern over Heathrow it was amazingly beautiful but that only made the unpleasant breakfast experience worse! My seat would not move one millimetre but was pronounced broken as soon as I explained the problem. The flight attendants were excellent.
1419,We flew Montreal to Rome Oct 4th and back Oct 18th. We found Premium Rouge very good. Food going to Rome was good food on the return flight was excellent! We had no problems with the free iPad and the movies were up to date. In fact we liked using the iPad! Seats were roomy. Check in staff were good. Priority boarding for Premium Rouge was good. Staff both flights were excellent and attentive. Would definitely fly Rouge again but would book Premium Economy.
1420,Washington Dulles to Beijing and on to Manila and return in Oct-Nov 2014. This was the most economical flight that I could find and I did not expect great seat comfort or great quality food. The boarding in Dulles was a mess. The majority of people on the plane were Chinese and non English speakers who queued up to board when there was some indication we would soon be boarding. The ground staff announced in English that we would be boarding from the rear of he plane and started to announce a range of rows. The people who had gotten in line saw people from the rear rows trying to board and started pushing to board because they thought people were cutting in line. The ground staff started yelling to stop pushing again in English. The ground staff finally got a Chinese speaker to make an announcement and restore some order.
1421,April 3 flight # 1820. return April 17 flight # 1821. Rouge not good. Please do better leaving a seat in the middle open on each row is a bad fix. April 17 flight from Cancun great staff. Much improved. Seat depth and width are the issue. Proud of Air Canada and the Maple Leaf Logo.
1422,My husband and I flew A/C Rouge from Toronto to Dublin on Oct 7 and from Dublin to Toronto Oct. 20. We were pleasantly surprised. We had heard that there was little leg room no screens and no meal. But we found the seating room was fine. We took our iPads so that was fine. We had a meal on the way over and a meal and snack on the way back. The crew was pleasant as well. Our only complaint is that people are allowed too much carry on. We had no room when we got on so the attendant took my carry on to the other side of the plane. I wish that could be more strictly regulated. Otherwise the flight was very good.
1423,Flew Tokyo to Beijing and Beijing to Singapore and back. Nice flights all round. The aircraft's were comfortable and clean. Service was efficient particularly the ground staff who guided us very nicely through a short transit time. We had excellent service on the Singapore to Beijing portion but the Chinese foreign minister was on the same flight. Otherwise the service was efficient and the food was very presentable without being spectacular. Seat was fantastic and the full flat seats a joy to use. However I would recommend their business class as being a reliable comfortable product. A bit more work and it would be truly spectacular.
1424,Sep 19 2014 Flight 982 New York to Beijing. Flight 179 Beijing to Manila returned on Sep 27 2014 flight 180 Manila to Beijing. Then flight 817 Beijing to Washington DC. My first time on Air China I was very pleased with everything flight was on time the crew very attentive to the passengers. I had 4 meals on my flight all were very good. I will be flying Air China now for all my international flights.
1425,YYZ to SYD via YVR in business class aboard 777-200 LR. Toronto to Vancouver leg was standard domestic business class experience. Ok food good entertainment nice service. Vancouver to Sydney was excellent. Nothing to complain about at all. Service was superb. Great meal service and a well stocked galley for between meal snacks. Tried the dim sum chicken breast skewers and fruit - all good. The pod seating is very comfortable. What really impressed was that the washrooms were so clean throughout the entire 15 hour flight. I used them frequently and they were always spotless. Air Canada really stepped it up on their international business class. To give you a comparison I've flown Singapore Airlines a few times and on this long haul flight Air Canada was even better (in both directions). I hope economy class had a good experience as well.
1426,Very pleasant business class flight on Air China from Beijing to Houston on gleaming 777-300. The highlight is the seat. It creates a very comfortable lie-flat bed and comes with a large fluffy duvet and large pillow - making for very restful sleep. Cabin crew was friendly attentive and hard-working albeit robotic programmed and not proactive in responding to passenger needs/desires. Food was decent - about average for international business class. Wine list was decent too but crew served white wine and champagne warm. We had to constantly ask for refills of wine and water in very small glasses. Air China would do well to learn the fine points of premium service from Star Alliance partner Asiana. Inflight entertainment had handful of American movies/TV but an understandably heavy emphasis on Chinese entertainment offerings. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and would recommend Air China's international business class but you may need patience with the staff and dealing with their lacking English language skills.
1427,SYD to PEK then PEK to LHR Airbus 330-200 second 777-300. After reading so many negative reviews my expectations were very low and I was dreading the experience as I had never flew business class before apart from Jetstar business. Having said this we were pleasantly surprised at the service food and the cabin. Both flights were without a doubt the best trip I've had. Comfortable beds totally lie flat in Airbus around 30 in business class so it was extremely quiet and personal. Toilets were always clean FA were attentive whilst they may have had difficult in speaking fluent English we got by. Inflight entertainment was the only drawback in terms of selection not up to date movies but nonetheless there was something you could see. As this was a night trip I enjoyed the sleeping arrangement more. We had a layover in Beijing to break the trip. The other leg to London plane was newer and business class had about 80 people so I think the attentiveness from FA was a little less but that's understandable again food bed and toilets were great. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending Air China I would certainly fly with them again.
1428,YVR to LHR return. Both flights quite satisfactory even with 100% full plane on return trip. All staff keen and some put out real effort. Two issues: Very poor food on return trip. Not really edible at all and the plane was a few minutes late in LHR with getting a landing slot. We went merrily to the Maple Leaf arrivals lounge for a shower and a bit of food after the flight. We got there at 12.45 and was told it was closed for showers and limited for food. It says it closes at 1.30 and we thought there was plenty of time for both. Staff were lifeless. Very disappointing.
1429,Flew SYD-PVG-Narita-PEK-SYD. Check in was done by another airline in Sydney I was first in line and requested an exit row seat (being told by Air China they were allocated on first come first serve basis but I was told none was available yet there were vacant exit row seats available on the flight. The toilets on each flight were not clean when I got on the flight nor were they cleaned during the flight. No Movies on demand. The air hostess doing the English announcements was impossible to understand. Wanted us to buy duty free but there were no duty free brochure in the seat pocket on any sector. The food was pretty ordinary. They were cheaper than other airlines. Their seats did not recline into your face. Seats were comfortable and despite all of what I said above I would fly them again based on overall value for money.
1430,"CA 1330 CAN-PEK (Sunday at 10.30am departure). CA is not my go-to carrier because they are priced higher on average and they don't have much flight time options for this route comparing to China Southern. Unless someone pays for your flights this under 3 hour-ish flight usually can just get away with economy seats because it is too short to enjoy anything premium. I got a half-priced business class deal this time so I tried it. Overall: I think it really did not mean much unless you are saving up miles with them. The word ""lukewarm"" can summarize my entire experience from the lounge service (staff) to the in-flight lunch (room-temp un-appealing Asian dish) that was served 60 minutes before landing - imagine how they ushered me to finish the meal within 15 minutes. No friendly name calls like United (they don't even greet you by name) and they skipped me for drinks and hand towels because I took a nap. I suppose I need to be alert the entire time to be adequate enough for serving? The only CA advantage I can recall is when there is delays relating to the oh-so-Chinese ""air traffic control"" CA flights always gets to leave first after the delay - almost always. Take it if you are tight on time."
1431,We recently were on a flight from Los Cabos BCS Mexico to Toronto. We departed Mexico just after noon for our 5 hour flight. Not long after take off the staff proceeded to sell food. We were seated towards the rear of the plane and therefore expected to have slim pickings from the menu. We did not expect a total sell out of meals. We had a choice of a few snack items such as chocolate bar chips twizzlers and nuts. According to staff they sold out after 1st class and had to even sell off staff meals. I think it's unacceptable that the airline cannot better predict the amount of meals that are required for a 5 hour flight.
1432,Los Angeles - Vancouver full Embraer E190 was a very pleasant flight despite the time late at night. The service was great and very friendly. Overall the aircraft was good and fairly new with spacious seats arrangements of 2 and 2 and great entertainment system (though the TV's could use a bit of improvement). Onboard cafe was overall normal and the menu selection was good. The terminal's Air Canada operated out of were efficient and my bags came out very fast. Turn around time was fast. Things that need improving the plane needed to be a bit cleaner and the boarding lines need to be organized more. But Overall it was one of the best airline experience I had on a trans- continental flight.
1433,"LAX-YYV-CDG on 14 March. Check in good rapid friendly. Boarding take off smooth appreciated the idea of rear passenger loading first saves all the usual hassle why don't others do it after Business of course! Negative was the fact that the ""domestic"" classed flight from LAX to YYV which takes almost 5 hrs - no food was available most of the snacks neither. Very poor considering I had 3 children and 5 hrs is not short. Later on the YYV-CDG leg food was poor and ""breakfast"" was a slice of banana bread...do they think we are all monkeys? Poor and the main reason I will avoid AC in the future even the Canadian Air Transat does better. Flight was otherwise ok staff not overly friendly or young; have done this route regular with Air France KLM United Delta and Lufthansa."
1434,YQB-YUL-ORD on 13 March. See my United review as to how I ended up on Air Canada. What a great set of flights. Friendly ticket agents at the gate smiling welcome on both flights. DH8-100 from Quebec to Montreal - coming from Sept-Iles so people were onboard when I got on - flight was 45 minutes and drink service from a friendly attendant. Departed 15 min late and arrived 10 min late - long walk to US gates. E-190 to O'Hare - got upgraded to Biz Class. Awesome friendly attendants on the plane. Nice chicken wrap was serviced and inflight entertainment really good. Air Canada knows how to treat passengers and deliver a great product.
1435,YYC-NRT we were lucky to get upgraded on this near empty flight and very much enjoyed the premium perks Business Class on AC had to offer Seats were comfortable mood lighting eased jet lag and food was spectacular.
1436,Round-trip Montreal-Rome in Premium Rouge on the B767 on one of the 2 non refurbished B767 with only 3 rows (instead of 4) - older seats but more legroom. Very satisfied with trip overall - lots of legroom food was good got some sleep in the recliner style seat service was good overall - just some minor issues / inconsistencies that you don't see on mainline. The leg rest and footrest were useless for me because I am tall. The big pillow added the lumbar support. Great value for price paid. Of course not a flatbed like business class but also not the same price! So for me I would not hesitate to take again premium rouge on the B767. I would also strongly consider trying the premium economy section on mainline 787 and 777HD after my experience on rouge.
1437,Flew JFK-PEK-PVG rude staff at JFK not enough food on planes good seats friendly staff at Chinese airports.
1438,Flew SFO to Beijing in business class. Worried from some of the negative reviews. It was excellent. Flight attendants were great. Food excellent. French wine. Seats laid flat. Plenty of entertainment. Great flight.
1439,For half the price almost for travelling return to Athens Greece from Sydney Australia 27/7/14 and 28/8/14 I can't really complain. Only differences I found from Emirates Singapore and Etihad: No spirit drinks in Economy class. No cold beverages just room temp (no ice). No mini toothpaste and toothbrush. Very bad entertainment system takes 10 mins to find a movie and only option is tab button to navigate. On the positive: Travelled safely and on time. Staff smiled. Very clean toilets staff cleaned toilet after every 6th person. Mostly Chinese passengers that just slept all the time. Very fast to board for flight and passengers were not pushy. Transit in Germany was only 10m from gate. Cant wait to travel again next year hopefully.
1440,Travelled from Singapore to Beijing and back on CA970 and CA 975 respectively. Delighted to note that Air China's services on this route improved both in terms of amenities as well as crew services. The crews especially those on the return flight had warm smiles on their faces and took care of the passengers comfort and convenience. They offered great care and assistance to a young flyer sitting in front of me. These improvements make it a promising flying option.
1441,LHR-YYZ. On-time departure with arrival 10 mins early in Toronto. Flight crew was friendly and generally efficient but disappeared to the galley for a long period during the middle of the flight. Food was average wine was good. Business class seat wasn't very comfortable and is oriented away from the window. IFE was OK but doesn't compare well to some other long haul carriers (although it has got slightly better).
1442,High Density 777-300 YYZ-YVR treated myself to an upgrade to Premium Economy and I must say I was extremely happy after seeing the cattle-car arrangement just behind me. PE is great! Seats are huge like domestic Executive Class on A320's A319's and A321's on AC but only if the upgrade is offered relatively cheap. My one complaint is that there should be a curtain divider between PE and economy and the cabin doesn't feel separated or intimate and noise and crowds spill over into PE. AC's new EnRoute system is a high upgrade over the old high-rez monitors much easier interface and improved maps. Seats are large leather arm-chairs same as Virgin Australia and Virgin Atlantic small footrest and small cocktail table in armrest. The economy 3-4-3 is just totally unacceptable to a North American consumer who are typically much larger than in other parts of the world. At baggage claim the complaints were loud people all around me talking of the horrid cramped conditions seats that don't breath and suffering passengers. AC get rid of this product it's horrid!! I will avoid at all costs it's no way to treat a human being. I can only imagine this product on a 13 hours HKG trip.
1443,We recently took an Air Canada Rouge flight from Edinburgh to Toronto . We had read many negative reviews but decided to try Rouge because it was a direct flight. For the most part we were pleasantly surprised. We found the flight attendants to be very efficient and professional. As far as the seats and configuration we agree with others that it is pretty crowded and there is not much legroom. The rented iPad worked well for the inflight entertainment system. While our overall experience was positive we think that there should be a far greater fare difference for Rouge flights compared to regular Air Canada service. If this is to be a discount airline the fares should reflect this. Because of this we would prefer to use full service carriers.
1444,ICN-PEK-HKG and back to ICN in economy. All flights on widebody A330 except PEK-HKG on narrow A321. All of the planes were of different quality. Some had new seats some had old seats some had seatback entertainment on demand (others on loop). Planes showed a little age but nothing worrisome. Onboard product varied greatly. Many delays due to ATC in Beijing. That meant maybe 30 mins to 1 hr of just waiting to take off for a gate you name it. The cabin crew and pilots did their best to keep everyone informed though. The cabin crew was polite and welcoming. As they were short flights I never had to ask for anything. They spoke basic English but oddly on ICN-PEK and return only one attendant spoke Korean over the PA only (pax about 50/49 Chinese/Korean and 1% Westerner). Airline food is not supposed to be gourmet in economy but Air China's food was completely inedible. Dry noodles that stuck together no sauce no flavor just horrible. Normally I can eat all of my food but I definitely just left it untouched. All flights were short (under 3 hours) so the seat was comfortable and didn't cause any problems. AVOD selection was limited to perhaps one or two recent western movies some really old western movies and lots and lots of Chinese selections. The price was right for this trip (500 USD) at peak vacation time in Korea. We only had one layover in PEK on the return to ICN. It was quick and painless. I'd fly Air China again.
1445,I am a Million Miler who flies business on long haul with AC. The angle pod seats were a great addition some time ago and provided business passengers with a feeling of value for money-true lay flats reasonable privacy etc. I cannot understand why AC would want to screw this all up with the new high density layouts in both business and economy-the business seats are resulting in mass complaints and mass desertions to other airlines. They downgraded their product to Hong Kong (in economy there are two or three fewer washrooms for 100 more passengers line ups a mile long the toilets are backing up as they are not designed for this volume of passengers. I have never in all my years heard more angry passengers than the Honk Kong to Vancouver AC passengers in any class. For a crass money grab on these routes AC is risking a big revenue loss to Japan airlines Cathay and other Asian airlines and on Europe runs to British Air and others even Lufthansa. This high density move is a complete disaster on the 777's and AC should reconsider. For those of us in the air a lot this change of equipment downgrade is a real choice maker.
1446,Flew AC 883 CPH-YYZ you certainly get back what you give on AC. I always decide to treat the crew like gold smiles and thank you and you get that back. AC 883 was about half full to very lucky to have two seats aisle and window all to myself. I greeted the crew with smiles and they immediately offered my double food two desserts and about an hour later one member brought me a tray with bread and cookies I immediately went to the back and thanked them again. Flight was an ageing 767 but saviour these old birds as you'll never again get the incredibly comfy 2-3-2 configuration again on the 777's and 787's. My one complained on these old planes is the seating near the exit rows gets extremely cold colder then when these planes were new.
1447,Went PEK-ICN. Before flight service was quite nice with them inviting me into the first class lounge for being a Star Alliance Gold member. In-flight entertainment was also good with a variety of options available on the system. However I rather dislike how they don't allow the option of choosing a seat when making the flight booking as I ended up in the exit row right in front of the lavatory. The flight itself however was okay with service being acceptable although not as attentive as one might expect (they seemed to begin offering landing cards and then walked away several times etc.).
1448,"We flew from Houston to Beijing in Biz Class - then First Class on the return. There were a few of the attendants that had language barriers but that did not effect the trip whatsoever. The food was good - not great. Although the duck coming back from Beijing was great - but there were only a few servings of that available. The wine selection was okay - and the movie selection was fine. The GPS/Mapping system was fun to watch as we went over the arctic circle. End of day the business class seats were great - my wife was able to sleep most of the trip there and back. I had a harder time in business class being 6'5"" - I was able to stretch out straight but my feet were at a 90 degree angle b/c of seat in front - since I laid on my side most of the time it really wasn't an issue except for when I wanted to stretch out. This wasn't an issue in first on way back. Our boys were in economy and I took water bottle back to them - that was a different world back there but they appreciated the water. (A lot of the windows were ""open"" and it was quite a bit noisier in economy - not surprising but it was a bit of a shock going from the dark quiet of biz class to economy). We did read one review that mentioned how hot the plane was in Houston b/f takeoff. We experienced the same thing. I don't think they lease the A/C equipment at the airport or something like that - b/c we didn't have that problem in Hong Kong or Beijing - and both of those planes were on the tarmac during the heat of the day (Houston flight was at 1am). Problem went away shortly after takeoff. We would fly them again!"
1449,Flew from YWG to OGG via YYC. Air Canada Express leg from YWG-YYC. Gate agent paged me and offered an exit row instead of my originally assigned Y class seat which was beside a mother and infant. Loved that the gate agent was so thoughtful. Last Minute upgrade purchased from YYC-OGG at an additional cost of $700. Enjoyed the flatbed for the 7 hr flight. Service was OK. Once meal service had concluded J class passengers would have to ask for whatever they wanted by accessing the forward galley were the crew congregated. No moving map on either flight however both flights operated onetime. Confirmed with crew that this may be the last season Air Canada mainline operates to Hawaii as Air Canada Rouge will take over this flying which will not offer flatbed seating. Flew back on United from HNL-YWG via ORD as AC fares for a Y class ticket one way was in excess of $700.00. Purchased a First Class ticket on United for $860.00 was served dinner and breakfast and had no charge for checked bags. Beverage glasses were never left unfilled and water glasses were even topped up while passengers slept. No need to venture to the galley to ask for anything.
1450,Flew from Montreal to Athens. The plane was very new and clean I had one of the most relaxing trips because the plane was empty if all the seats were taken I am sure my experience will be very different. The staff were not bad but after dinner no one saw them until breakfast. I found the cabin air very dry and the staff not once offered water or any other liquid. If the plane was not as full maybe I will fly them again. My trip satisfaction rate is high because the plane was empty and I had three seats to myself.
1451,Flew from PEK to SFO with Air China CA985 a brand new Boeing 777-300ER plane. Seat was comfortable with personal 9-inch PTV. Films and music were good. Cabin service and food were also satisfactory. The flight was punctual and I'm very satisfied with the journey. Hope to fly with Air China again next time.
1452,Just flew Air Canada Rouge (Toronto to Montego Bay) for the first time. Had heard horror stories and read the reviews about them so took nothing to chance. We took our own food to eat (which we have done for years with regular Air Canada) and had movies on our laptop to watch rather than the common movie which was being shown on the plane. I had also downloaded their entertainment app on my iPod in advance so could watch their entertainment system as well. Flight down was delayed leaving for about half hour and flight back slightly delayed. Took advantage of their single cart service when it was offered for soft drinks but other than that didn't ask for anything. The flight itself was no worse than some regular Air Canada flights I have taken and we were fortunately we were able to get the bulk head (at an extra cost) so had sufficient leg room. Overall was satisfied with the flight because I expected nothing from them other than flying me to my destination.
1453,Took Air China for the first time on my first trip to China - from LAX to PEK on Jun 21 and PEK to IAD on Jul 10. Based on some negative reviews on this and other sites I was a bit worried about spending 12-14 hours on an old plane with lousy service bad food and non-English speaking staff. My expectations were completely shattered: our plane was the latest Airbus model seats were very comfortable the flight attendants very attentive and polite all spoke English and the movie selection was just fine. First time travelers to China are well advised to choose Air China. Moreover the passport and custom controls at Beijing Airport beat almost any US and European standards in terms of ease and friendliness.
1454,YYZ to YYC on Feb 14 and back the following day in economy. Both flights operated by 320 Airbus with plenty of legroom good entertainment and decent enough buy on board. I recognize AC is not everyone's favourite airline but I have rarely if ever at all had any major problems. One thing though: I would fly neither Rouge nor the new 777's with ten abreast seating.
1455,I am a frequent AC flyer. Short-haul between YVR and Edmonton or Calgary. From not happy with them - over the last few years they have improved markedly. On-time is very good and so is customer service. I think they deserve the 4 stars. Last flight was Calgary-YVR. Airport is good shape and new massive addition almost ready Gates staffed with well dressed and smiling (YES smiling) staff. Travelled on a business class upgrade. Flight on-time attendant greeted me by name with great courtesy food service just ok (same two light entrees seem to repeat a lot) wine offerings excellent and served promptly carefully and with a little style. Hot towels very hot seats ok took my coat hung it up and returned before landing.
1456,We flew Rouge from Toronto to Venice because it was a direct flight. The outbound plane was older and the seats are definitely too small and too close together. God help you if you had someone in front of you that wanted to recline! The crew however were young and more friendly than most we've had in a long time. Seemed to be more flight attendants also. Our return trip was on a newer plane and the crew were again very friendly and helpful but the seating was the same. People need more room!. We were aware of the inflight entertainment option with iPads but were surprised at the few old movie choices and offerings. These flights were too long to have such limited entertainment. I'm glad that AC has changed its mind about Rouge to Barbados.
1457,Flew Jakarta-Xiamen-Beijing and Beijing-Xiamen-Jakarta route. The journey took place in December the northern part of China was absolutely freezing. When I arrived in Xiamen there was no problem. The problem was actually when I arrived in Beijing. The pilot parked the aircraft far away from the terminal. By the time I got off the plane the temperature was below 5 degrees Celsius. We needed to be transported by bus to the airport terminal. The seat on the aircraft alone was very narrow quite an inconvenience for me. Overall it was fair.
1458,Flew FRA-PEK-HND KIX-PEK PEK-BKK and BKK-PEK-FRA. Service on the longhaul flights was good FA's friendly and their English was fine. Food was okay for coach. Shorthaul flights were fine too but nothing special. All flights on time and always got an emergency exit seat for free. Seats were comfortable I didn't check the IFE because I had my tablet with me but it seems to be average. Very good value for money! Tickets have been very cheap und nevertheless I could change my last flight back home for free. Excellent customer service at the office in Frankfurt!
1459,EZE-SCL-YYZ. Feared the worst after reading other reviews however must admit I was very satisfied with this flight. Good friendly service regular drinks distribution during the night decent inflight entertainment and acceptable snacks and meals including complementary alcohol which isn't always the case on NA carriers. On time departure and early arrival at YYZ. Glad the older two-class 777-300ERs are used on this route rather than the newer high density aircraft.
1460,"MEL-PVG outbound 26/12/13 PVG-Wenzhou 26/12/13 PVG-MEL inbound 9/1/14. It's not the best airline out there but acceptable for the direct connection to Shanghai and value for money. Timing of flights meant meals were served just after takeoff and just before landing with not much in between (stewardess came around with water 1-2 times in about 5 hours many passengers went to the galley to ask for drinks themselves). Seats not much room but you tolerate that in Economy Class. Inflight entertainment is standard stuff albeit with a focus on Hong Kong movies and Cantopop. The Chinese service industry has still not mastered the art of the ""false smile"" so hostesses can seem surly and over-officious compared to other airlines. English announcements not of great quality which is not really acceptable on an international flight to an English-speaking Western country. They do provide English announcements even on domestic flights if there are any foreigners on board. On return flight they tried to put 3 of us (including a 3 year old child) in 3 separate rows although cabin staff sorted that out well. It's not a patch on Singapore Qantas etc. but for the convenience of a cheap-ish direct flight you can put up with it."
1461,YYZ-NRT in Y class. I take this flight several times per year. It is a convenient direct flight from Toronto to Tokyo. This flight left on time (actually departing the gate a few minutes before the scheduled noon departure time) and we were in the air at 12:09 with no lengthy runaway or taxiing delays. Arrived a few minutes early in Tokyo. To me this flight is a notch above the standard AC product. They seem to be a little more attentive on their transpacific flights and the flights generally have a good on time performance. Service consists of full meal shortly after takeoff snack about 6 hours later (noodle cup/sandwiches) and breakfast prior to arrival. Drinks (including alcohol) are complimentary. In summary a good flight with a reasonable price and good service.
1462,Zurich to Toronto (Flight 879 on Feb. 13) on a rather ageing tired Boeing 767 - however it was not a full flight so we could easily change our assigned bulkhead seats to two by the window in an exit row - which afforded us great legroom. FAs were wonderful - a senior crew - very welcoming helpful and chatty. Likewise the pilot was great fully informing and updating passengers of a slight delay due to a technical glitch and later alerting us to a great view of the southern tip of Greenland when we flew over it. After an equally long flight from Mumbai in the rather cramped seating on a Swiss A330 this flight was a spacious delight. Food was OK AVOD was good with a wide selection of movies music and TV shows. The FA selling duty free items undertook the extra effort to locate what I wanted to buy when he could not find it on the cart. Not a commonly expressed sentiment but the crew on this Air Canada flight went above and beyond the call in providing a level of service seldom encountered in the economy cabin!
1463,FRA-PEK-HKG on 12/27/13 and from HKG-PEK-FRA on 01/03/14. Long haul flights with 777-300ER and medium haul flights with 777-200 and A321. Clean and modern aircraft's the 777-200 (15 years old) was clean. Flights were on time. Flights were fully booked except the flight from HKG-PEK. The announcements in English were too low and mostly incomprehensible. Meals were ok for economy class. Only 1 option (rice porridge) from PEK-FRA was absolutely inedible. Lots of drinks service from FRA-PEK. Cabin attendants very friendly. IFE system was quite good. From PEK-HKG and from HKG-PEK limited IFE system with overhead screens. Seat pitch for medium haul flights was very good and for the long haul flight acceptable. Overall all very good.
1464,Whilst most elements of the flights we took with Air Canada were acceptable rather than outstanding there were two elements that were really poor. Firstly the entertainment system was not working on one 7hr flight and the first stewardess just said she'd look into it but didn't. The second steward admitted they knew it was broken. The real issue though is that the only recompense offered was 5% off our next Air Canada flight. The second issue was the rude check in staff at Vancouver airport - not conducive to generating repeat business. The sooner the Middle and far Eastern airlines get a firm foothold into North America the better.
1465,After reading many reviews I was very apprehensive about our flight from Toronto to Montego Bay. The flights were on time and we found the staff young but professional. Maybe because we're not tall people we had enough leg room and didn't feel cramped. We also found the flights to be nice and quiet without the carts going up and down the aisle every little while. We ate before we got onboard and had snacks with us so that wasn't an issue. Would fly Air Canada Rouge again if the occasion presented itself.
1466,I travelled from Melbourne to Vancouver with a technical stop in Shanghai Pudong and transit stop in Beijing Capital - and return. I was very impressed with the service. Flight attendants on all flights were very friendly attentive and polite. They were welcoming with smiles and laughs all around which made the long flight quite pleasant. Food was excellent - great Chinese cuisine (more western choice was also available) with generous servings. Inflight entertainment was good. To top things off - I bought the ticket at an excellent price - considerably lower that all other airlines. I would definitely consider flying with Air China again.
1467,AC151 Toronto - Vancouver. The only good thing was the online check-in through Air Canada's iPhone app I was lucky enough that there was one exit row seat (has extra legroom) that no one purchased off at extra cost or checked-in earlier so I got that. Apart from that everything else was quite bad. The staff were not attentive. You ask them something they promise they will get back to you then they forget. When you click the button to call the attendant no one ever comes even though they walk by. As usual no food on domestic flights only drinks. The plane was dusty as usual.
1468,I recently spent between $3000 and $4000 for 3 seats on Air Canada for a vacation to the United Kingdom for my wife sister and me. It was important for all of us to sit together. When I tried to get seat assignments their computer system did not work. I had to call instead and spent much time on the phone getting it done. We made the flight to London and were served a small breakfast and I was skipped. On the flight home we were shunted from one departure gate to another. On our third different one the computer system would not work and we were told we would have to be moved yet again when it finally kicked in. As we were boarding our final flight the stewardess pulled my sister from her seat and gave it to another person. I protested and asked how that could happen and we were told that a husband and wife who had not bothered to reserve adjacent seats had asked for my sister's reserved seat and they just gave it to them breaking up our family group to do so. We will never fly Air Canada again.
1469,"PUS-PEK in a B737-800. Plane not new but clean and inviting. Departure on time (also due to generous turnaround time in Busan) arrival in Beijing ahead of schedule. Flight not fully booked thus our middle seat fortunately was left empty and provided some extra comfort. As in many Asian airlines the announcements in English were too low and mostly incomprehensible certainly a risk for emergency situations although you rely on the fact that this is not your first flight and you know the ""rules"". Lunch was served on this flight of almost two hours two standard options decent food - absolutely ok for economy class. The Chinese (white) wine they served is strange to European palate but you almost feel like Robert Parker and keep tasting and discovering. Overall impression of the crew was positive: polite and efficient not eager to talk. Limited IFE with overhead screens just the usual equipment in a 738 of about five years of age sufficient for a short haul trip."
1470,I recently flew SCL-EZE-SCL economy class. Relatively new 777-300. Good flights average legroom and recline. Cabin crew attentive and polite all the time. Personal IFE system standard and requires some maintenance. Both flights were at meal times food was good but very poor only a sandwich and soft drinks.
1471,Took AC156 Vancouver to Toronto on January 16th. The flight was on time the crew friendly no problems at all.
1472,Several rounds recently on Shanghai Hongqiao-Beijing sector all B777-200 or new B777-200ER. On time departure and arrival spacious let-room for economy class comfortable seat friendly staff provide efficient service I've decided to switch to CA from MU despite being an elite member of MU!
1473,Flew Sydney to NYC via Beijing. New planes inflight entertainment decent food and good service! Also no cost stopover in China and the new VISA on Arrival (free) service that allowed me to do some sightseeing and break up the long trip. Only complaint was some passengers were too excited at the beginning of the flight.
1474,AC963 Bogota to Toronto on January 30th. There was a 4.5 hour delay as mechanical problems required the aircraft be replaced in Toronto. We were advised and given free meal vouchers to eat either at a restaurant in the airport or a hotel close by. Everything handled very professionally. No problems on the return flight the food was actually quite good the crew very considerate and the entertainment system worked fine!
1475,Flight AC 962 Toronto to Bogota on January 16th. Flight was on time the crew very good but the breakfast served very poor. Entertainment system worked fine and we arrived on time!
1476,YYZ-EDI 2 Oct 2014. Booked in Premium rouge this being the fourth sampling of Rouge since they started operations in July 2013. I have read other reports on this forum about the negative comments about AC rouge therefore there was an element of concern of what to expect! Premium rouge permits priority boarding at YYZ this was done efficiently. On boarding the aircraft it was clean and tidy with water and menus placed on the seat arms/dividers. The crew were young and friendly they are not however as professional in service presentation as those on AC mainline. The safety announcements were fine as they should be. The leg room in premium rouge is similar to that provided on AC mainline Executive class. I am 6?? and I was comfortable for the overnight flight of 6hours +. A choice of chicken or a non-meat dish was provided for dinner with drinks included for the fare paid. Hot towels and linen for the tray tables are provided prior to the first meal service. Meal orders were taken shortly after departure along with offers of complimentary I pads for IFE. I did not bother with the I pad as I wanted to sleep after the dinner service which I managed to do for around 2 hours. About 1.5 hours before landing at EDI a small continental breakfast was serviced. The flight landed at EDI on time and with a carry-on bag I was though the airport in around 15 minutes after landing. Having experienced 2 AC mainline flights in Executive class immediately prior to this rouge flight the rouge service stood up fairly well hopefully the professionalism to service will follow with age. I am already considering AC rouge for future trips to North America the real down side is that at present the EDI/YYZ service is only available mid June through early October.
1477,"First Class Beijing to Nanjing in 737-800 and my first flight with Air China. Check in fast priority security queue lounge very pleasant with nice wine but a surly staff member pouring it ""battery car"" to the gate so could board last in a leisurely way was a nice touch. Long taxi flight itself was fine once in the air. Wine not great as great in the air as in the lounge and no entertainment but hardly needed for a 1 hour 40 minute flight (+30 minute taxi). Staff friendly and cabin OK but a bit tired. Luggage delivered quickly to ""red carpet"" rather than the carousel was a nice touch. Better that most domestic Star Alliance carrier First or Business flights I have had recently in Europe or the America's."
1478,MEL-FCO return. If you are a business traveller and you have to be somewhere on time choose another airline as Air China has a tendency of running late. Other than this Air China was compatible to many other airlines I've flown with. Staff were extremely efficient food was tasty except when flying out of China. IFE was good with a mixture of international movies seats were comfortable and in excellent condition toilets were always clean and the plane spotless. Consistency of Air Chinas services are an issue eg: food out of china does not compare with the quality of that of Australia's. The drinks are sometimes served on the warmer side. All considered I found Air China to be good value.
1479,Halifax - Gander - St. John's - Halifax. (A 5 day business trip) Despite snow storm in Halifax flight to Gander was only delayed a bit by the necessary de-icing Gander to St. John's no problems. St. John's to Halifax another snow storm. Check in was quick and was offered an earlier flight if I wanted. Given the snow this was appreciated and took the offered flight. All flights good and staff professional.
1480,MEL-FCO return. If you are a business traveller and you have to be somewhere on time choose another airline as Air China has a tendency of running late. Staff were extremely efficient food was tasty except when flying out of China IFE was good with a mixture of international movies seats were comfortable and in excellent condition toilets were always clean and the plane spotless. Consistency of Air Chinas service are an issue: food out of China does not compare with the quality of that of Australia's. Also the drinks are sometimes served on the warmer side. All considered I found Air China to be good value.
1481,17-19 Jan 2014. I was shocked to step onto my flight going to Orlando from Toronto. No more TV ok I can deal with that but the seating was greatly reduced! There was no leg room and I'm not even tall. I feel sorry for anybody taller than 5'7!
1482,"Hohhot-Beijing. Delayed 3 hours before boarding. Initially told we'd be delayed 15 minutes then were told we'd be delayed ""for a while"". For the second and third hours we were told that the delay was because of dangerous weather on the route. This would have been a lot more believable if we hadn't seen several other flights to Beijing depart during the same period. I know flights are going to be delayed especially into and out of Beijing but the airlines need to be straight with us about what was happening. We boarded 3 hours late pushed back and were then told we'd have to wait another 15 minutes - it turned out to be 45 minutes - before we could take off. The flight itself was fine - 45 minutes in a new clean 737 with polite service. But the delays would be a lot more bearable if they'd tell us what's going on."
1483,I flew from YYZ-YFC on January 9 two days after the shutdown due to weather at YYZ. The check-in was very busy however there were staff on hand to help out. The plan pushed back on time however a teenager felt sick as we were taxiing to the runway and did not quite make it to the washroom on time. We needed to go back to the terminal to get the cabin cleaned. The delay was about 1.5 hours however I have to commend the flight crew on handling the situation with tact and compassion. I hope if I ever fall ill on a plane I get treated the same way. During the delay the flight crew gave out water and gave constant updates and communication. They performed very well considering the circumstances.
1484,YEG-YYX (2) YYZ-LHR FRA-YYZ YYZ-YEG (3) YYC-YYZYOW-YYZ. (all Y class) These were my travels for 2013 with Air Canada. Overall I enjoyed the level of service they offered. Only few flights delay by 30 mins maximum. Air Canada food service buy on board or complementary on international needs a major revamp as the quality seems to be going lower. Flight attended were decent but did not amaze me in any sector however the ground staff were more friendlier.
1485,"Toronto - Buenos Aires packed Boeing 777-300 seat 4A. The intercontinental Maple Leaf lounge was very comfortable quiet with an adequate selection of snacks and refreshments. Boarding in Toronto was simply chaos a mob of people pressing toward the jetway. Premium boarding lane was worthless and the 7 visible staff did not appear to have the situation under control at any point. Flight crew in Executive First cabin was inconsistent. Service Director was a gem very gracious. But the rest of the front cabin crew didn't seem to want to be there. Eye contact & smiles were absent and the environment lacked any genuine sense of welcome. We took off after midnight and I opted for the express meal which was adequate but not great. The lie-flat seat with duvet and pillow is very comfortable for a good night's sleep. Unless you plan to crane your neck in strange ways don't plan to be able to see out the window. Why were the pods designed to face the aisle? Plenty of overhead space but minimal storage space around your actual seat. There was a fair amount of trash (newspapers plastic wrappers boarding cards) from the previous flight around my seat and in the overhead bin. The bathrooms were in poor condition. AVOD choices were plentiful and the system was easy to use. In the hopes that this was simply an ""off night"" for AC I'd take this flight again."
1486,My first time flying Air Canada in a while YVR to LHR and back. First of all my ticket price was the cheapest out of other possible competitors. The seats had comfortable leg room and I didn't feel cramped. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. Also the food wasn't bad. I was pretty happy to have got ice cream for the first time on a flight. Drinks were served 3 or 4 times throughout the flight as well. The entertainment was great and had a lot of choices of movies and popular TV shows. The aircraft was clean and left the airport on time.
1487,"We flew AC Rouge to Venice on Aug 23 having paid for the extra leg room seats. The flight was good and the extra leg room was great. Having read many reviews complaining about the cramped seats. It would be nice if the cost of the extra leg room seats included a few extra perks (like priority boarding and/or free drinks) as $90 for a one way is a bit steep. The flight was good excellent service. I was surprised that a flight to Italy did not have any announcements in Italian. The in-flight entertainment was OK on our iPhone and iPad. Although not ""advertised"" the USB plug on the arm rest came in handy for keeping our devices charged. There is also plug to be shared between the two seats by the window. Movie choices were OK but not as good as the mainline aircraft. I also really missed the flight data and maps that are available on most airlines."
1488,MEL-PVG-LHR-PEK-PVG-MELin J Class. PVG-LHR was code-share using Virgin so won't comment on that. CA178 was my first long-haul with CA. Mostly it was a pleasant trip with good service. A330 was in good condition. A few scuff marks at feet level. Bathrooms were clean throughout. Captain spoke excellent English and FA announcements were clear English. Requests to FAs were mostly understood. Service when the call button was pressed was very prompt. Meals were fine. Presentation was a bit naff but food OK. The seat was good the design made me think of J in Lufthansa. I worked the whole trip so didn't try it as a bed. Access to the power point and headphone socket was fiddly under an armrest. The overhead light was not accurately aimed at the table. Amenity pack was OK. Mostly working so not much time for AVOD. Video feed quality was excellent. Headphones not noise cancelling but adequate. LHR-PEK - Departed on time. Good quality pyjamas provided and the bed comfortable. Blanket a bit on the small size. Meal service was fine. Choice of movies was OK. Headphones were very good with noise cancellation. PEK-MEL - First time trying PEK as a transit. Not good. Arrived in T3. After walking about a kilometre reached the transit desk. Half an hour later I was through. Had to take the train then finally get to the domestic lounge. Was called to the gate but stood for 45 minutes waiting for the bus to the plane. Plane to Melbourne was via Pudong. Lunch was OK then arrived at PVG. A man with a flag rounded up all the MEL pax and herded us to the baggage claim area then to immigration. Bit of a queue there. So after about a 750m walk arrived back at the same gate same plane. All in all I came away with perception of 4 star service for the air portion. 2 stars for the transit service at PEK maybe 2.5 stars for transit at PVG. A pity because Air China itself was fine.
1489,CDG-Beijing / Shanghai-CDG. First class on the way out business class on the return. Check-in at CDG was smooth and Air China own staff greeted each first class passenger and was escorted to the passport check area. The star alliance lounge has friendly staff but pathetic choice of food and tired facilities. On board the seat was comfortable and turned into a bed. It was however like a Turkish Airlines long haul business class seat but with more privacy. Male flight attendant was very kind and nice but definitely needs a touch up on grooming while female flight attendants were immaculate in grooming but need a brush up on service skills. Bizarre meal combination with Chinese spicy chicken and prawn served with Risotto. Whole service lacks refinement and sophistication of other airlines but very efficient. Return check in at Pudong was fast and friendly. Did not have time to visit their lounge. Flight was operated by an old A330 but still with a seat that turns into a full flat bed. Did not eat and slept for a good 8 hours. Cabin crew on this sector were all attentive and very friendly. English did not seem to be a problem on the flights I took as others experienced. Inflight entertainment has a lot of choices but has a strong focus on Asian / Chinese speakers.
1490,Santiago - Toronto. There was a problem with my ticket but the airport ticket office agent was sincere and thorough dissolving the stress and resolving the issue with a smile. Air Canada uses American Airlines' Admiral's Club in Santiago which is very pleasant but quite full at night. The gate was crowded and announcements were difficult to hear but boarding was orderly and efficient. The cabin crew was outstanding on this packed overnight flight. And this makes all the difference. Welcoming friendly sincere. We pushed back within 15 minutes of departure time. I opted for the full dinner. While the food itself was average the service was very attentive (this crew hustled!) and the wine selections were surprisingly good. The IFE system had a wide range of choices and was fairly intuitive to use. The bathrooms appeared worn but were clean. The lie flat seat (3D) is very comfortable. Breakfast was a disappointing rubbery omelette but I appreciated being able to sleep until shortly before landing. The breakfast buffet in the Maple Leaf Lounge was very pleasant the receptionists were gracious and there was no wait for a shower room to freshen up before my connecting flight. Bottom line: a very pleasant cabin environment warm crew and comfortable night's sleep.
1491,YVR to YCG (Vancouver/Castlegar) return at Christmas/New Year on DeHavilland Dash 8. Both our flights to and back were cancelled twice not because of Air Canada but due to snow and fog in Castlegar. As a result we missed Christmas there as originally planned. Both flights were surprisingly pleasant with lots of legroom on the plane and fantastic on board service. In fact the service on board this little plane was more attentive than my executive first class flying YVR/HKG return three months ago.
1492,"Excellent Flight and service. We travelled Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to Barcelona on 17 Sep 2014 and returned 28 Sep 2014. We originally had premium seating both ways but we changed our arrival date and had to settle for economy. Prior to leaving I read these reviews and was mortified and dreading our flight for 8.5 hours. We boarded the plane it was clean new and right off the bat the staff were wonderful. Many reviews complain about the age of the staff? Why? They are extensively trained and I would rather travel with this crew than the stuffy old sky bags on other Air Canada flights. The leg room was perfectly fine in economy. I am 5'11"" and 210 lbs. not a small lad and I was comfortable the entire way. As for air circulation that is normally an issue on regular flights as you are always adjusting the flow and on overnight flights there is a tendency to lower the pressure of air flow and turn up the temperature to make folks sleep. Not on this flight. The air flow was good you could feel it and it remained a comfortable constant. Meals were provided which normally are not. Drinks were available as usual. As for the inflight entertainment the IPad thing was perfectly fine tons of options. We did not know about this but if you read your itinerary email it tells you. Also you can rent one of theirs for a small fee. Our return portion had us seated in the premium seating just a little expense more and again more leg room but really it was perfectly fine. Better than United Air which I will never fly again. This flight was great we were comfortable. It is a budget flight as advertised and we would do it again. For those complaining we have flown around the world both on economy and first class and this flight was fine. I think they are complaining because that's what they like to do. Did not hear a single complaint from anyone on the entire flight. Air Canada Rouge is a hit. Thanks again to the wonderful flight staff for a great flight."
1493,PEK-LHR checked in early and got a window seat. Security at T3 something of a nightmare each checkpoint (of which there are about twenty) has it's own line which pass through a barrier and when joining the line it's impossible to see but every other checkpoint is staggered so the checkpoint might be just on the other side of the barrier in which case there are about five people ahead of you or it's much further away in which case there are thirty people ahead of you and the difference is worth about an extra twenty minutes. One last complaint about the airport at least in summer - it's incredibly hot so despite preparing for comfort on a long flight one always boards sweaty and uncomfortable which is rather awful. The route has been upgraded in July to a Boeing 777-300ER. Boarding smooth with a final security check in the jetbridge reducing congestion at the aircraft door. Every seat was filled except the one separating me from my neighbour which was lucky. Pushed on time and made a smooth takeoff and climb. Meal service was tasty and hot chinese seafood and noodles. Air China still have one terrible habit of (even on a daylight flight) insisting - at times rudely - that all window blinds are closed. Why on earth is this? It's an all-day flight that arrives late afternoon a lot of sleep in flight is actually quite counterproductive to beating jetlag. I opened it an inch to enjoy the sights of Russia enough to see out but not enough to incur the wrath of the cabin crew who were kind and laid-back on every other issue - top up a drink? an extra bread roll? no problem. Want to look out the window on a daylight flight? I enjoyed the excellent on- demand entertainment options which included plenty of first-rate western movies. Second meal service was another tasty hot meal as we left Russian airspace. Landed on time at Heathrow. Baggage claim was pretty quick. Cut out the nonsense with the window blinds and get some aircon in the flagship terminal at their capital city and Air China will have the makings of a pretty good national airline.
1494,BRU-YVR via YUL on 767 and A320 both ways. Service attentive but not overbearing. The seats were comfortable and the food was good but nothing to rave about. Flight 2 hours delayed leaving BRU due to heavy thunder and lighting and I missed my connection in YUL before even leaving BRU. I mentioned this to the FA and when I went to recheck my bag in YUL after customs my boarding pass for the next flight to YVR was waiting for me. On the return YUL-BRU leg the service was a bit rushed and it seemed like the FAs just wanted to get it over with and hang out in the galley. I also noticed a certain haughtiness among Air Canada's FAs on international routes. They're the top of the heap seniority-wise in the company and they know it.
1495,We took a flight from Manchester to Toronto on the B767. After reading the reviews on here before I left I expected the worst. I am over 6 ft tall and so asked at check in whether they had any extra leg room seats available. They did and I was placed there free of charge. Once on board I found the seat was a bulkhead by an emergency exit so although I couldn't stretch my legs straight there was more space than other seats. My friends hadn't requested extra legroom so we're sat further back in the plane. I went and joined them for a small time (plane was half empty) and the space was no where near as bad as made out on here. Ok space is tight but the cabin felt open and refreshed. Food and service was ok but felt they were a bit stingy with the drinks (only serve soft drinks and only brought round twice) plus no water served in between. Having said all of this I wouldn't like to fly on here should it be a full flight so would try not to use them again unless it was the only option.
1496,LGW-PEK-HKG. LGW to Beijing on a A330 delayed 40 minutes and was completely full. Reasonable inflight AVOD entertainment system containing a selection of Chinese and Western movies. Food served was edible and expected from economy class. I liked was the super fast removal of food trays. Beijing International Airport is huge and with less than 2 hrs to catch our connecting flight proved stressful. Found no time to relax look around or for something to eat. Onward flight on a A320 seemed to have more legroom. On arrival at Hong Kong in the early afternoon one of our bags had not been put on our flight but fortunately delivered to our Hotel later that evening. Found return journey stressful due to time constraints. Flight delayed and so had just over an hour to get our connecting flight. Fortunately flight delayed 25 minutes so we managed to get on board. Our ticket price to HKG was quite cheap but I probably will not consider this route again.
1497,YYZ-FRA and CDG-YYZ on the way back. Both flights were flawless superb entertainment choices (IMO the best I've seen so far). On the way out a new 777 was quite nice and comfortable. On the way back to Toronto the older 767 did the job quite well - a great flight nice and funny crew. Check in was fast for both flights. If you have any food allergies/preferences let them know in advance. The lactose-free meals that I received were pretty decent.
1498,My wife and I took Rouge from Montreal to Rome 3 weeks ago. I was very apprehensive given the stories of extra onboard expenses small seat and questionable service. We were both pleasantly surprised. The seats were great (we had a bulk head seat) and the service was excellent. The staff onboard were very young and attentive. The food was certainly adequate and surpassed my expectation. The entertainment system was very good and affordable. My only concern not complaint was our seats were located under the A/C vent and in order to keep the rest of the plane comfortable my wife was wrapped in several blankets and her coat on. The young attendant provided her with a free entertainment system to help compensate. This was unexpected and appreciated. I would fly Rouge again with no apprehension.
1499,Winnipeg to Vancouver to Shanghai return trip. Flew this trip numerous times before. Nothing too special until on AC026 from PVG to YVR. The crew did their best to make you feel at home. A couple of shortcomings to mention: 1) AC025 on Dec. 20 the second meal was not fully hot. 2) AC026 on Dec. 31 flight data were not available on personal screen. But all these can be forgiven because the crews were the best I have ever seen in business class.
1500,I recently flew ATH-YYZ on Rouge. It was much better than I expected - but I think that was probably mostly because I was in Premium Economy. The regular seating section really looked cramped and passengers there did not look happy. The good: great flight crew. Yes they are young and yes they wear funny outfits (the hats are ridiculous!). But they were all really friendly helpful and attentive and I saw no evidence of lack of knowledge. The seat was very comfortable - not business class but definitely much roomier than even 'normal' economy. On time take off and landing frequent drink service and decent food (for an airline). The bad: the Premium seats seem to be anchored by some mechanism that completely blocks the under-seat space. That meant there was no room for my shoulder bag - which I have successfully placed under seats in much smaller aircraft. As others have noted the iPad connection is not always reliable and I had to restart it a couple of times.
1501,"LGW-PEK-HKG and MNL-PEK-LHR in Business. Very pleasantly surprised. All on time on the outbound. Comfortable seat on A330 on the long haul from LGW. Connection in Beijing was surprisingly simple although they need a business class security lane in the transfer hall. Lounge in Beijing fine if unspectacular. Return was excellent. Very friendly crew up to Beijing - I was the only business class passenger but they were great without being over the top. One hour delay on the flight to LHR due to a passenger off load but I can forgive that as it's outside of their control. New 777 business class is excellent particularly the seat comfort. Agree with comments about the food a bit hit and miss and strange that you have to say which of the wines you want when you order from the menu also a bit odd to make your choice for the meal served just before landing before you actually take off. Meals whether ""Western"" or ""Chinese"" had too many rice elements for my liking. Overall though very good flights and I'd choose again."
1502,I have had 4 flights with them this month firstly from Qingdao to Seoul return then Qingdao to Shanghai return. Being a Star Alliance Gold member allowed me to check in at all times at the Business Class check in so it was pretty quick. Got an upgrade on the way to Seoul. Service on all 4 flights very good. food reasonable for short haul flights. Crew spoke excellent English and welcomed people both on boarding and leaving. On the international legs there were even announcements from the flight deck in English. Boarding as with all flights on Chinese carriers is a very quick and no nonsense affair. I have been using Air China and other Chinese carriers for 11 years and avoid them on long haul but found them to be excellent on short haul flights.
1503,Flew on AC554 on 27 Dec. Flight was pretty good: YVR-LAX. My only complaint about this airline is the prices that are almost $1200 o/way for 2 adults / 2 children then $150 for baggage is a bit steep. Make sure your flight attendant doing PA's is able to speak clear English not broken English as it is very difficult to understand what they are saying. I would understand if we were on JAL or ANA not Air Canada. Truly disappointed.
1504,Las Vegas to Calgary and return in December. Overall excellent. Planes spotless in flight entertainment great food (taste and presentation) was the best I have experienced on North American carriers Canadian wine offered a nice touch. Captains on both directions provided updates and information. Great flights.
1505,LAX-PEK on 1.7 year old Boeing 777-300ER on June 12 2013. Check-in opened early which was nice. The boarding process was orderly got to seat at the rear of aircraft with ample overhead space for carryon. First meal was served about 1.5 hours into flight labelled as 'light meal'. I was expecting the worse but the meal (noodles or rice) was actually really good and plentiful. Second meal about 2-3 hours before landing and again plentiful and tasty. Personal TVs for IFE was pretty good with Chinese and English choices. Only complaint is FAs they speak little to no English. They did not do water runs as well but I did see people asking. They did seem cheerful though. The seat itself was good with foot rest and nice recline. Second flight PEK-MNL on Boeing 737 on June 13 2013. Boarded through bus and stairs. FAs spoke better English and did water runs. They seemed attentive. Ceiling mounted plasma TVs as IFE had some programs on it. The meal was almost inedible though.
1506,I wanted to believe that the reviews I read before my Rouge experience were exaggerated by picky pampered flyers. Sadly the reviews were accurate Air Canda Rouge is no bargain. I just flew 8 hours from Montreal to Rome on AC 1920 Sept 20 2014. 8 hours of uncomfortable seats that kept buckling inward so I felt my neighbors every move in their seat. When I asked for water it took them 40 minutes to bring me a cup with attitude since I used my attendant call button. On an 8 hour flight I only received two beverage services that were water and coffee. Lack of water is unhealthy on a flight this long. I actually paid 81 usd to upgrade my seat to a window seat. Worst decision - very cramped seat. Do yourself a favor switch to regular Air Canada. I have never written a poor review for an airline. Sadly they deserved this review. Oh and the inflight app stopped working every 10 minutes and the wifi only services the app. Sad service.
1507,My husband and I flew Dublin to Toronto direct on 8 Sept and returned Sept 15 in the premium economy cabin the aircraft was a 767 both ways with a 2-2-2 seating configuration. We chose this airline mainly on price - approx Â£ Â£400 cheaper per ticket than British Airways or Virgin PE from London via I think New York. The first thing to say is that if you are expecting Business Class seating/facilities you will be disappointed. This was nothing like the BC we have used on Emirates and Turkish Airlines. However as a premium economy offering at an exceptionally good price we were very pleasantly surprised - in fact we could not fault it. I would judge it not quite as good as Virgin PE but certainly equal to if not better than British Airways PE. We were able to use the priority lanes for both check in and security clearance on both legs the aircraft was clean and comfortable the cabin crew were all extremely pleasant helpful presentable and very professional (other reviewers have complained that the crew are young and inexperienced; they were certainly young but we could not fault the service they provided throughout). In fact I much preferred the Canada Rouge crews with their positive can-do attitude to the 'Can I really be bothered?' stand-offish attitude I have experienced more than once on British Airways. We had no problems at all with the tablets issued to us for entertainment an issue that some reviewers have been unhappy with. The food choices were not extensive but certainly sufficient of good quality and presented nicely. Drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic were good quality and frequently offered. I would say well done Canada Rouge - in our experience you have an excellent value for money product at least in the PE cabin. We will certainly use again for transatlantic flights.
1508,I fly usual once a year from Toronto via Munich to Izmir/Turkey. All flights have always been enjoyable and the Air Canada crew was just wonderful. Last August the same except: The food was lousy. I rather take my own food in the future. Returning to Toronto the crew did not have enough time to collect the trays and to hand out immigration papers. The crew make a flight a pleasure or a horror.
1509,SYD-PEK-SYD in Business Class. Travelling for work all I really want is the cheapest business class seat that I can find for overnight flights to China there are few options reasonably priced. Air China's offering on A330 equipment is an older style seat but is virtually flat and with plenty of space. It was set quite low to the ground so was easy to hop over the person adjacent when going to the toilet. Food below average for business class and AVOD was limited with mostly older films. Didn't really matter too much when I slept most of the 11.5hrs each way. Flight crew were efficient and polite but characterless. Australian captain noticed on the return flight which was reassuring.
1510,Flew LAX-PEK in Business and return PEK-LAX in Economy. Business class hard product on the new 777-300 is top notch. Service was very good and food quite on par with my other usual choices when flying to China including UA OZ and AC. Overall if I was flying business class I would choose Air China again if the time and price was right. My return flight in PEK-LAX was in economy. Again 777-300 hard product (seat) which includes in-seat power plug for your laptop was quite good but the seat pitch was borderline acceptable. The IFE system is good AVOD but lacks enough current Western content. That aside I would not recommend Air China economy to anyone because of the quality of the food. Quite simply it was some of the worst airline food (very low quality Chinese food). Several of the side dishes were inedible.
1511,"Copenhagen-Toronto on a worn out 767-300 though slightly cleaner than the one I travelled on the other direction in May. The 767 has just become outdated cramped and too small for 8+ hrs flights. Adorable lightning in the cabin though. Barely room for carry-on luggage and the wall was freezing! My travel companions IFE did not work (decided to sleep instead). However a few pros as well: Meal was delicious! Staff was nice brought drinks several times. Flight on time excellent connection to LaGuardia (but made it only because of nice AC-staff bringing us in front of the US-immigration line. I have to say the experience on the AC 777-300ER Frankfurt- Montreal in May was somewhat nicer. Wonderful aircraft with lots of space (the ""old"" 3-3-3 seating in economy) and very nice interior service level fine."
1512,Flew Vancouver to Sydney November 2013 in a 777. What a great experience. The most space I've had on a long haul flight. Service was efficient and friendly and price was very low. Only slight criticism was the food which was pretty ordinary. All in all though I have no hesitation in recommending Air Canada.
1513,Hong Kong-Beijing-London and Paris-Beijing-Hong Kong return. Both flights between Hong Kong and Beijing were fine and on-time a fair meal was served between 3 hours duration. Staff was friendly and tried to meet request made by most passengers. PEK-LHR A330 served with a lunch and dinner meals are acceptable. Legroom is fair for a 11 hours flight and staff regularly provide drinks in between. CDG-PEK B777 served with a dinner and breakfast the legroom was bit less than the A330 to LHR. You can't demand much more for what you have paid for compared with CS/QR/EK etc.
1514,GRU-YYZ-LGA. Checked in online and used the bag drop counter at GRU. Check in staff was super friendly and fast. Boarding the 777 was via stairs after being bussed to the plane according to seat rows. The gate area seemed too small for the 2 big flights leaving was hot and crowded. But that's GRU. Completely full flight. We ended up leaving 50 mins late thanks to passengers who didn't realize the gate change. Once airborne crew set to work quickly with dinner and drinks. Food quality was better than on the outbound from Toronto. Crew worked hard but some without any smiles. Same seat experience as on my outbound. Cushion felt hard and worn so pretty uncomfortable for the long haul. Movie selection didn't seem to have changed from the previous month. Arrived a little late in Toronto went through all the US customs screening etc and found our flight to EWR had been cancelled due to weather. The customer service agent we then dealt with was really just great. Friendly concerned and patient - quickly booked us on an alternate to LGA. She called their baggage people to ensure our bags would be transferred accordingly. This flight was scheduled to depart only about 45 mins later than our original. However after boarding we were informed by the captain that we'd be on the ground for under 3 hours more due to the hold at NY. Not fun after the long overnight. But at least we had gate to gate IFE on the A321 we were on. The movie selection this time was a little different so managed to pass the time. Crew did water runs and handed out cookies while we were parked. They were friendly and very pleasant. We eventually got to LGA as expected 3 hours later with bags delivered very quickly. A long and very tiring trip from start to finish made much more pleasant thanks to the efficiency courtesy of some of Air Canada's staff and crew.
1515,Dep YYZ 1 September 2014 to CUN Dep CUN 11 September 2014 to YYZ Premium rouge 2A outbound and 2C inbound. After reading the horror stories about Rouge I approached these flights with some trepidation. With the exception of the A319 seating in Premium Rouge service was on par with the former business class. Meal selection and inflight service was up to par. The only issue I had was trying to use my own IPad the selection on the Rouge iPads was far superior. I do however object with paying business class for Premium rouge when other airlines only charge less for similar service and seats. Would I fly with them again? Yes.
1516,PEK-LAX. New 777-300ER was completely full a very young crowd so much excitement during boarding. Once underway the passengers were very well-behaved. Crew reasonably friendly and immaculately presented. Two hot meals - one soon after takeoff and another about 5 hours before landing. After the second hot meal sandwiches were distributed for passengers to snack on for the remainder of the flight. Entertainment was a good selection of movies on individual screens. Pushed on time to the minute and landed forty mins late due to headwinds. Only complaint is almost all pax on Air China are Chinese and hence all have visas which means each pax takes longer for US immigration - which can be interminable at the best of times - will take an hour unless you're one of the first off the plane. For me it took 1h20m to clear immigration which was also the case when I flew the airline PEK-LAX last year. Other than that charming and professional will definitely fly Air China again.
1517,Frankfurt to Toronto. Positive: Customer service was efficient and courteous spacious clean and comfortable aircraft. Negatives: Horrible food - absolutely atrocious - We were served a hot meal shortly after departure and because the flight was booked they ran out of different meal options so by the time they served the back of the cabin not only was the food cold but we were not given any meal options. Apparently there was a chicken dish available but we were served a disgusting pasta Bolognese dish. The roll was stale and the side was some form of potatoes which had been reconstituted from potato flakes. Apparently others on the flight had similar issues with the chicken dish which tasted like rubber and a salad which had wilted. It was extremely disappointing and I did not eat any of it. Later on we were served Air Canada's 'signature' tortilla/wrap by Monty's which also tasted horrible and is worse than a pizza pocket. The meals and food in general were terrible and I pretty much went the entire flight without eating anything. I hope that Air Canada revamps their meals and offer healthier options instead of meals that look and taste worse than 'TV dinners' or those you would get from a can. I understand that many individuals have varying dietary requirements and allergies but perhaps Air Canada should invest in a dietician or nutritional consultant to encourage healthy eating on the go while meeting the needs of their customers.
1518,Traveled with a group from YWG-YYZ-DFW in Economy. Slight delay in YWG due to weather but they made up time and only arrived 15 mins later than scheduled. Easy connection and on to DFW with AC Express fantastic crews both ways clean and comfortable E75's. Return departed DFW early and into YWG on time. Excellent experience crew were all friendly would gladly travel with AC again.
1519,My husband and I just deplaned from the Toronto - Barcelona flight. Having read the mounting negative commentary on Rouge over the last few months we were prepared for the worse. We were pleasantly surprised. The 767-300 was clean and maintained the bathroom likewise the attendants all friendly and personable. We were in premium and there was a big blanket and pillow and a small bag of toiletries plus bottled water at our seats. Food was most satisfactory (same as AC as I had most of it earlier in the day). No complaints and such a relief to have gone Rouge. Plugs below the seats for the electronics. Premium rouge will never be business class - still rather cramped but I would fly it again and we will on our return home! The inflight entertainment was easy to hook up to with my iPad and mac air but it kept disconnecting necessitating 9 more clicks at least 10 times thru the flight to get the program back that I was watching.
1520,Hong Kong - Beijing - Moscow Sheremetyevo with Air China on their A321 and B777 because their more competitive price than any other airlines. Check in staff in HKG not polite due to early morning flight or maybe seeing my Chinese passport? Ground staff in PEK was polite . HKG-PEK arrived on time while PEK-SVO delays 4 hour because of waiting for transfer passenger (not sure if it is the real reason) but CA distributed foods and drinks to us with no extra cost. Compare to unfriendly cabin crew on Air China I have seen before cabin crew on these two flights were friendly and attentive with limited English ability on both segments. I found my no-lactose special meal tasteless and asked for another regular one which was tasty and good. Seat on B777 PEK-SVO is very comfortable with good recline. No IFE on both segments. I would still recommend Air China for their price and attentive service.
1521,CA984 LAX-PEK. On-time departure of a (new) 777ER. Great AVOD with movies in English and Chinese not recent releases but good adequate selection. 2 full meals Chinese fare both consisted of rice or noodles with beef or chicken good and abundant. No western meals menu. Frequent cabin walk-throughs with water. Self-serve refreshment section in the mid-galley. FA's professional and efficient. Great seat pitch and recline on coach. Overall a very pleasant experience on a long haul flight. Boarding was not by row or section just general boarding but surprisingly quick and efficient. Impressed by the nice new 777 ER. My experience was totally contrary to most reviews on CA perhaps the introduction of new aircraft was the key.
1522,Flight from Shenzen to Guiyang. Domestic flight. Flight was delayed. Onboard I found the seats very hard and you could feel the frame of the seat. The meal was just a small piece of cake and a bottle of water that didn't taste very good.
1523,Newark-Toronto-Sao Paulo. I was impressed with how punctual Air Canada was on these two segments. In fact it was announced at EWR it would be likely we'd even leave early. Arrivals at both points right on time. Onboard cabin in the E190 felt much more comfortable than the 777-200 down to Sao Paulo. Cabin crew were efficient and polite on both sectors though not particularly warm on the longer overnight. Except for the Brazilian crew member who was all smiles and bubbly. Seat cushioning was a little hard and made it hard to sleep comfortably. Service quick meals average. Crew were present throughout the flight with water runs. I liked that there was On demand IFE even on the shorter segment but what isn't fun is how long it takes to fast forward the numerous ads to get to what you actually want to watch. Coupled with a slightly outdated interface and laggy response - you almost feel like not using the system at all after a while. However the selection was pretty good and varied. Time for an upgrade though - faster and higher res screens would be great.
1524,After reading all the reviews here my wife and I didn't know what to expect from Rouge. We flew from Toronto to Edinburgh on Aug 28 and were very pleasantly surprised. My wife is pushing 6' and not once complained of leg room she did have an aisle seat where I get the window seat and I didn't have a problem either. Food was airplane food what else can I say it was hot and edible didn't once have a problem with any request from the crew. Crew was very professional and courteous young and full of energy. Must say better than some of the flight crew on the mainline AC a smile goes a long way. We flew Rouge on the return trip Sept 12 and experienced the same service. We knew of the inflight entertainment and came prepared I liked using my own IPad I could watch or listen to my own or theirs. We would fly again on Rouge we liked the route and really liked the price over mainline Air Canada.
1525,My wife and I flew from Melbourne to Munich return via Shanghai and Beijing in July/August 2012. Apart from the delays in mainland China on both legs Air China was actually very good for the low return air fares paid. I wouldn't fly with them again purely on the basis of the long transit delays at Shanghai and Beijing.
1526,After my much delayed China Eastern flight to Qingdao (see posting under China Eastern) I changed my approach and took an evening flight to Qingdao with Air China. As a Star Alliance Gold member I checked in hassle free at the Business Class check in and proceeded to the Air China lounge in Shanghai Hongqaio airport. Lounge well stocked with drinks and hot food. Boarding on time small delay taking off but landed on time. Return trip also took off on time but no meal service due to turbulence but who needs feeding during a 80 minute flight. We even had an announcement from the flight deck in both Mandarin and English. Arrived Shanghai Hongqaio on time. Overall a good flight at a reasonable price.
1527,YEG-YYZ Oct 2013 and YYZ-YEG Oct 2013. Both segments were on-time and overall great experiences. The IFE is top- notch staff service was great and overall a very professional service. But a little frustrating that people that upgrade with points get service before people that pay for the ticket. When I was flying to Brazil it was not this way.
1528,AC1900 Toronto to Athens on July 17 return on AC1901 on Aug 7. Our flight on AC Rouge to Athens was comfortable and we found the staff to be friendly and competent. As others have commented the seats are close together but my husband and I were comfortable (I'm 5?™ft 4??he is 5 ft 11??. The food and beverages were fine (meals included spicy pasta with a small salad or chicken breast with vegetables light snack included warmed wraps). We were regularly offered water during the 10 hour flight. With the Rouge app downloaded in advance the entertainment is fine. We had no trouble connecting to in-flight entertainment during our flight. Our son has an allergy to peanuts and having read the reviews on this site we were concerned for the cleanliness of the seats (potential cross contamination causing an allergic reaction) and the competence of the staff. Anyone with serious allergies will understand the level of worry that comes without access to medical assistance for a long period. On both our outgoing and return flights the flight attendants were very attentive and in both cases asked passengers sitting close to us to refrain from eating nuts which we greatly appreciated. We didn't use the blankets and pillow provided (brought our own) and brought allergy free food for my son so we didn't require any special or additional attention from AC.
1529,Shanghai Pudong-Chengdu on first class with A320 flight delayed 15 minutes but still arrived on time cabin crew friendly and polite good inflight service seat comfortable and did manage to sleep for more than 1.5hrs food awful and quality is far below the CX/JL/NH/SQ economy class food!
1530,We flew from Paris to Montreal in the newly reconfigured business class and were amazed. We loved the new seats so comfortable modern and top of the line. Service and food were a delight they've come a long way.
1531,I recently travelled from Calgary by Air Canada. to Salt Lake City through Houston Texas. The flight attendants could not have been more helpful and pleasant. My connection at Houston was tight. Unknown to me they arranged for me to move to the front of the plane so I could be one the first to get off. I was in a wheelchair. The airport worker in Houston dropped the ball and did not take me to my next gate as arranged. As a result I missed my connection and had to wait until the next day to get to Salt Lake City. Air Canada had I felt gone out of their way for me.
1532,HKG?“PEK last month on an A330-300. I am beginning to think that all the Chinese airlines don't keep a very good schedule because this flight was late leaving as have all other Chinese operated airline flights we have been on for our trip. Upon boarding we both noticed that the FA?™s were very nice and extremely helpful to us. Aircraft was either new or had been refurbished because everything was spotless. After takeoff the FA?™s began there services. The drinks available were limited. The most popular American whiskey in the world was not available so we had to accept lesser things. The food was good and all the services were done well. The FA?™s English was sometimes not too good but both sides were able to make the other understood.
1533,CTU?“HKG. Last month my wife and I traveled from Chengdu to Hong Kong. Their price was a little more expensive than others but their schedule was much better than anyone else. Check in at CTU was very efficient as was security there. Once we reached the assigned gate we were told that there was a gate change but it was just across the terminal - no problem. Then the flight was called and we found that we had to go downstairs and onto a bus to be transported to the plane. After riding all around Chengdu airport (which is large) we finally reached our plane. Of course it was parked at a remote place and we had to climb stairs to the cabin. Upon entering the aircraft we found it to be a newer 737-800 with plenty of space for everything. The FA?™s were very polite and their English was good. The services were efficient and the meals and beverages were good and tasty.
1534,Beijing (PEK) - San Francisco (SFO). Aircraft was a 15 year old 747. Cabin amenities were showing their age. Seats were the new kind and were quite comfy and could recline well. Lack of entertainment was troubling but I had brought my own entertainment. Food was average and was edible but could be better. Overall a not bad flight.
1535,Flew from YYC-EWR-YGK-YYZ-YYC. Flight left on time. It was 60% full mostly people on business but for me it was vacation. Got some apples and some noodle soup. The soup was salty but fine and the apples were surprisingly good. The inflight entertainment system was good and tons of choices. Flight from YGK-YYZ was a 1-1 configuration which was different and no drinks served but only a 50 minute flight and no flight attendant or cockpit door. Flight from YYZ-YYC was an A320 and same entertainment system but the flight attendants gave all the kids on the plane ice cream and cookies left over from the Executive Class passengers.
1536,I have been an Air Canada Aeroplan member for over 30 years and I do a lot of overseas traveling from my home base in Phoenix Arizona. Fortunately Air Canada has connected Phoenix with Toronto since the mid 1990's making overseas connections quite easy. In winter there is additional service to Calgary which enables flight connections to London and Frankfurt. Recently Phoenix service was converted to the new Air Canada Rouge budget category. All I kept reading were negative reviews about how cramped the business class was and how poor the food and service were. I traveled to Toronto on July 1 to connect to Frankfurt and returned from Toronto (Copenhagen) on August 30. Frankly I found nothing wrong with Air Canada Rouge. Yes the seats are smaller coach seats with the middle seat blocked out. But there was almost as much legroom as on a regular Air Canada domestic flight. As for lunch en route to Toronto and Breakfast returning to Phoenix the food quality was comparable to a regular domestic Air Canada flight. And the young flight attendants though not clearly as experienced were very attentive. I would prefer a return of regular Air Canada service but I did find Rouge an acceptable choice and with Calgary now being a year around connection and the addition of Vancouver I am very pleased. These are short flights and the added comfort of domestic first class would be nice but I for one can live without it.
1537,CGK-PEK-SHA v.v. (CA 978 CA 1549 CA 1832 CA 977). All flights were on-time with short transit time in Xiamen airport for immigration clearance except the PEK-CGK sector which was delayed up to 3 hours with no explanation (I guess that was due to snow and weather). Meals on board so-so except from PEK to Xiamen which was totally tasteless. Crew service not bad some looked happy and dedicated to their job others just take it for granted. If you aren't too bothered with service quality Air China can be an option.
1538,CA105/CA106 Dalian (ZYTL) - Hong Kong (VHHH). Classified as an international flight but the service is not good. Food and beverages are the same as a Chinese domestic flight. The only entertainment is some small TVs.
1539,Flights in December and January from London to Sydney via Beijing and back. We armed ourselves with our own food and laptops with extra batteries for movies etc. but we have found this to be one of the better flights we have ever been on. The attendants were polite and pleasant and all spoke English. The food was lovely and more than enough to fill you up with drinks at regular intervals. And if that wasn't enough you just press the button and ask for more. Toilets were as clean as you can expect from 300 people all using the same few loos. But after almost every one went in an attendant followed to clean up and replace loo roll etc. Space between seats was more than ample with at least 10 inches between your knees and the seat in front and even when the person in front put their seat back the seat wasn't right in your face. The entertainment was really good with over 40 films in English and games and music and even TV shows. Overall we can not fault this air line and we would most definitely recommend to others especially with it being over Â£3000 cheaper than other airlines!
1540,AC from Winnipeg to Shanghai in Executive First. First segment was in E190 from Winnipeg to Vancouver Ok seat and the food and service was good. Second segment from Vancouver to Shanghai in a 767-300 with pod seating. The seats were great! Very comfy and infinitely adjustable. Food was good to very good entertainment system was great and all the cabin attendants went above and beyond to make sure you enjoyed your trip. Very personable outgoing and helpful. Air Canada you have ruined me for all lesser forms of travel!
1541,Return flight TPE-MXP via PVG (Economy Class). Good points: new aircraft's comfortable seats good variety of films and entertainment (big personal screen) nice food on-time arrival. Bad points: as said in many reviews staff quite unfriendly and often with bad English blankets not particularly clean and customer service is awful. No answer even after several e-mails. the call-centre is often busy and seems not to follow our instructions. Apart from that after being connected with an operator who spoke our language (after 4 days of trying) the problem was solved in a very efficient and professional way.
1542,Took 4 kids aged 3 to 11 to Sydney from London via Beijing. Check in was great both going and coming with staff giving us configuration of seats we wanted on all legs. Service on planes was good (unless you like to drink in which case Air China wouldn't be my choice!). Movies great for us and kids and food good (although beware the fermented black egg for breakfast which my 3 yo still talks about with horror). All flights took off on time and Beijing airport was fine if a bit limited in choices. Would highly recommend as their price was Â£2k cheaper than next alternative.
1543,Hong Kong - Gatwick return. Planes fine food ok price excellent punctuality mediocre. I was generally happy with this trip. Seats are comfortable and there are lots of movies to watch after you get the hang of the controls which are not so user friendly. FA's were great and the food was better this time round. However expect the 0155 from Beijing to Gatwick to be delayed as I have looked at its departure time for the past couple of months and it leaves late often very late each time. The plane is there but it waits for all connections to arrive which causes this long delay. Anyway given the good price I would fly with them again.
1544,I had the pleasant experience of traveling to Toronto from San Francisco on mainline AC and then from Toronto to Athens on AC Rouge and let me tell you I would choose Rouge over mainline AC every single time. The flight attendants were fantastic we were served drinks almost every hour and we were given two meals which were just as good as the meals on any other airline. The in-flight entertainment app had the exact same movies/shows as the mainline flight and it worked perfectly fine. Did I mention that the flight attendants were extremely nice? The plane (Boeing 767) was clean and updated but no charge ports anywhere in economy. We flew back to the states on Lufthansa and I was much more comfortable on our Rouge flight. For a discount airline (yes discount. Our tickets were so cheap! I'm not sure where these other people are booking their flights) Rouge is great and I'll definitely be flying with them again.
1545,CA 851 PEK-LGW 15/01/2013 A330-200 with new flatbed business cabin. Cabin was only 30% full. Nice and clean reconfigured aircraft excellent friendly service. Thick comfy comforters with cotton sheets and matching cotton pillow. Delicious food (I chose the Chinese dish) all served with Cotton tablecloths and real china. New AVOD system with excellent film selection. Hard to believe how bad CA used to be.
1546,Beijing-Shanghai (Hongqiao) on a new A330-300 Airbus. The configuration is used as business class on international and as first class on domestic legs. Flight left a little late - we arrived some minutes early. Seat quality meets high expectations. Did not use IFE (except the airshow) on this flight of 95 minutes. For lunch they offer a choice of 4 main courses plus a 'daily special selection'. All food is served on one large tray separate serving of appetizers etc. would probably be too time consuming. Quantity and quality fully acceptable so is the presentation and the cabin crews general service standard. In beverages Air China highlights a choice of 7 different teas 4 coffees. Glasses were refilled almost immediately. Overall Air Chinas domestic first class is a good product and an excellent value particularly if you can book a discounted fare being only marginally more expensive than full economy.
1547,YVR-YYZ and YUL-YVR I had a great couple of flights and AC continue to improve their service. Breakfast in the Lounge was great in Vancouver as was lunch in the lounge in Montreal. The FA were a friendly crew and very attentive. In particular a woman serving us on our flight back to YVR was great. I appreciated the selection on the IFE and they made the 5 hour flight go by quickly. I fly AC regularly and the staff seem much happier these days. They even switched aircraft from a 320 to a 321 as they has so many passengers heading to Vancouver.
1548,YVR to SYD Jan 24 2013 Flight was delayed from 23.45 to 02.45 so forked out $50 for Maple leaf lounge which was utterly disappointing. The flight attendants were the best I've come across on a round the world trip. There was a good selection of inflight movies and airshow map was also good. Food was horrible and worse than some low cost carriers. The seat was comfortable and have good legroom. Would fly again.
1549,"Flew Vancouver to Toronto after doing a whirlwind trip which included flights on United Hawaiian and New Zealand Airlines as well and found Air Canada to be better than United but nowhere near as good as Hawaiian or New Zealand. Flight attendant was not helpful she wasn't rude but she wasn't any where near friendly. She would just stare at you until you said something then stare at the next flyer not even acknowledge she had heard correctly then started handing out drinks. A simple ""What would you like miss/sir?"" is all that is required but that was too much for her. Customer service is important to me and when it lacks it severely diminishes my views on the product quality of a company."
1550,Flew YVR-HKG return Executive First in September/October. Both flights were really comfortable with flat seats for sleeping. Services were also good on the plane and at check-ins but the food on the plane was really bad. The airport lounges served better food than on the plane! So feed yourself in the lounges before boarding!
1551,I found the seats and spacing comfortable in coach. The design is minimalist. I understand that taking the wiring and screens out of the seats reduces the cost weight and maintenance. My wife had an issue with the lack of ventilating port above the head. She was hot the entire flight. I was comfortable. I don't like the message Air Canada sends when they encourage a monopoly in their own aircraft by only supporting Apple devices. It doesn't take that much effort to create the applications for Android and BlackBerry. My frustration spans from the surprise I got taking a 5 hour flight with no entertainment. Had I known I would have loaded a few movies on my Android tablet. This was last May and they said then that the Android app was coming. 5 months later it is still not out.
1552,After reading all the reviews I was very concerned about flying rouge - but I must say that we had a great flight from Rome to Montreal on August 31st. The crew were very friendly and helpful. The planes were old but very clean. There were more than enough Ipads for purchase at $10 for inflght entertainment. For me the hospitality of the crew is very important and it was nice to be treated well.
1553,CA 1231 8 Jan Beijing - Xi'An First Class. From check-in at Beijing to arrival in Xi'An an excellent service for a 1 hr 50 mins flight. Staff assisted with self service check in and baggage check-in fast track security procedures and access to the Air China First Class Lounge - huge facility with ample seating eating and entertainment areas. Seating on 737-800 2-2 with total of 12 seats. Hot towel and welcome juice or water on boarding. Very comfortable seat for a single aisle aircraft lie flat seats with ample recline and footrest. Choice of either a Western or Chinese breakfast - excellent coffee and bread basket service. Cereal fresh fruit hot meal of sausages tomato's and omelette. Another hot towel after meal. Attentive but unobtrusive service. Definitely a benchmark service for other airlines I use considering such a short flight.
1554,FRA-PEK-HKT and HKT-PEK-FRA Dec-Jan 2013. All other flights were delayed except the return flight PEK- FRA. Planes were clean staff kind the meals were the most tasty I have had on a plane. The movies on the FRA-PEK and PEK-FRA were new and good quality. Headphones were free which is unusual. All in all very satisfied. One thing I would recommend is: Increase the volume on the announcements.
1555,AC1830 on August 13 AC1831 on August 20. I was quite nervous about flying with Rouge given all the negative things I have heard from friends and family. My flight to my destination was uneventful - on time boarding was easy staff were friendly and I lucked out in that nobody was in the middle seat so I was able to stretch my legs given the compressed seating this was a major plus. The flight home was overbooked which although did not impact me is frustrating to have to deal with. The entertainment options are extremely limited - very few movies and episodes of TV shows. Staff were friendly and helpful no complaints there. Given my flight was short - just over five hours - it was a good experience. I wouldn't be comfortable flying with them on longer flights because of the lack of space. All in all they got me where I needed to go and that's all that matters.
1556,LGW-MEL via Beijing and Shanghai. Visa for Australia sorted out by Air China staff at check in after problems arose. Flights on time and all went well. Uncomfortable wait in Beijing for 9 hrs with little comfort before next flight. Can't understand why we were moved through immigration and around airport terminals to find out that the next flight was from the next airline bay! Planes were good conditioned airbus 330s food was good with choice every time plenty of fluids passed out by staff. Seat comfort onboard to Australia uncomfortable but better on return. Flight late leaving UK on time in to Australia but late landing due to bad weather.
1557,Hong Kong to Beijing. Wanted to fly Hong Kong to Toronto direct but booked flights with points and this routing was the only one available. Aircraft was an old and tired Boeing 777. A bit dirty around the seat area. We flew business and my foot rest was broken and could not be adjusted by the power button. When the seat in front was in the full recline position it encroached onto my space quite a bit. Flight was set for 2.20pm and it left on time and arrived in Beijing 15 minutes early good for me as I had a rather tight connection. The snack was a salad and fried rice. Food was just barely adequate which I didn't finish. Flight attendants spoke some English enough to get by. Would not choose this airline unless I have no choice.
1558,YYT-LHR 11 Oct 2013 and LHR-YYT 21 Oct 2013. Both segments were on-time and overall great experiences. My only complaint with AC is the lack of legroom in economy (I'm 6'2) but I've come to expect this. The IFE is top-notch staff service was great and overall a very professional service. It was fun to cross the Atlantic in an A319.
1559,Toronto to Varadero. If you are tall 5 ft 10 and over and a little fluffy you will not fit in the seats. I am short 5 ft 4 and not fluffy and I was cramped the seat in front of me felt like it was only 12 inches away from my face. I can not even think of booking Air Canada rouge for my family to fly anywhere as my hubby and son are over 6 feet tall. If you want food entertainment Wifi or a beer all cost and payable with Credit card. My return flight was an hour and half late with no explanation I had a customs form that needed to be filled out and since we left at 11.45 at night it would of been nice to get that form at the start of the flight not at the end of flight when I was woken up and not had my brain intact. The darn seats are cramped for me to purchase again on Air Canada Rouge it would have to be a flight of last resort. Never again.
1560,"I had AC Rouge for the return flight of my itinerary (BCN to YUL) and was dreading the 8 hour return trip based on the reviews I read here. I was pleasantly surprised perhaps due to my own lowered expectations and was compelled to write this review as I don't think this airline is getting a fair shake. The plane itself was clean and in good condition and the crew was friendly courteous and helpful. The flight offered meal service which was no better/worse than any other airline I've flown. Regarding the leg room I found no difference between AC Rouge and coach class on other airlines. By comparison I've flown transatlantic on Air Transat Air France and United and frequently use AC main line within North America. If there is a difference it's negligible. Overall I'd say the leg room was ""industry standard"". For instance during this same vacation I took a short haul flight with Vueling which I would say had ""no leg room"". Regarding inflight entertainment I consider this a non-issue. Yes there is no inflight entertainment other than the movies shown on the main cabin screens. However in this day and age of smartphones and tablets I was more than satisfied to watch movies of my choice on my phone. The only thing that would've been nice would be to have had USB chargers for devices (my daughters tablet ran out of battery 3/4 way through the flight). Ultimately my first priority is reaching my destination safely and for this reason alone I tend to gravitate towards Air Canada. Factor in the competitive pricing and I'm likely to fly with Rouge again at some point."
1561,HKG-PEK-NRT 12/12/12. First flight A321 cabin crew excellent although the English speaking FA had a very heavy accent which made it a little difficult to understand her. Service very attentive they actually opened the slippers and blanket pouches for you. Meal service came and they opened the tray tables for you. Breakfast however was watery eggs tasteless chicken sausage and spinach. In the past I have always found catering from HKG to be excellent but this was far from what is usual. Transit in Beijing was good arrived and departed from hard stands business class passengers had their own minibus to take them to and from the terminal. However transit in PEK meant going through an immigration check and there was only one open desk which the immigration officer took 10 mins or more on the passengers ahead of me on line. PEK to NRT on 738 with only 8 seats. Catering was sub par the steak was overcooked and the appetizers were brown tofu and dried fish. Again though the cabin crew were excellent.
1562,Business class Beijing-Sydney only recently upgraded to 777-300 service. Priority boarding for an on-time departure and early arrival. Friendly and welcoming service (with reasonable English skills) and very comfy lie-flat seating including a warm cotton duvet and good sized pillow. 2-2-2 seating 'angled' including a large screen with customizable moving map functionality that was as much fun as the entertainment selection. Food good but not a large selection and a limited selection of drinks but no big deal. Would definitely recommend.
1563,YVR-LAX mid-day on an Embraer 190. Everything about this flight was smooth and efficient. The plane itself is worthy of comment: smooth powerful yet quiet. The newish light-construction seats were very night and afforded me a lot more foot room. Air Canada's inflight entertainment is the best I have encountered. The service staff were young and correct. The only part of this AC experience that was poor as it has been on other trips is the check-in procedure. It was chaotic with most passengers not certain which queue to join (Check-in Bag Drop Ticketing Self-Check-in) even after they checked themselves in. AC needs to fix this. The fix is easy: have one person out front directing passengers.
1564,Flew Halifax to Goose Bay on 11 October flight was slightly delayed but time made up. Flight cabin staff good and service good. Return to Halifax via St. John's on 13 October both flights very good and cabin staff on both flights very personable and pleasant - a nice change. Tight connection in St. John's but no problems.
1565,YUL-YYZ on Air Canada Express YYZ-LAS on Air Canada Rouge. All the flights went smooth and on time from take off to landing. I knew what to expect when I purchased the ticket on Air Canada Rouge. There's no entertainment unless you have an Apple device (such as Ipad) and have download their application and be aware there's no charging ports on board. The flight crew was fine nothing special you have to purchase for meals. Overall it's pretty much the same service on a normal Air Canada flight but with less legroom even in the emergency exists the legroom is not a lot. Overall you get what you paid for on Air Canada Rouge which is fine but don't expect a super service and lots of legroom unless you fly in Premium class.
1566,Flew in July Sydney to Milan via Beijing round trip. Great price for the trip service on board was excellent on all sectors much to my surprise after reading reviews beforehand. Food although average it was plentiful and there were many drink runs throughout. Staff were also very accommodating and professional despite the language barrier but that was expected as it is a Chinese Airline. I will definitely fly Air China more in the future and they should be commended for their onboard service.
1567,FRA-PEK-MNL vv Economy Class November 2012. One of the best priced tickets to take me were I wanted to go. We flew B777-300 FRA-PEK vv and B737-800 from PEK-MNL vv. Never felt uncomfortable onboard. Aircraft's clean and spacious on all legs. Entertainment and food on B777-300 excellent. The only that was irritating was the quality of English the crew and ground staff spoke.
1568,YYZ-LHR-YYZ. Both flights arrived on time. Cabin crew friendly. Good in flight entertainment system. Food OK. Check in staff really good. Price better than Air Transat. In short Air Canada staff seem to have ditched their bad union attitude and combined with other flights to YEG and FLL is winning me back.
1569,Our family traveled from Vancouver to Los Angeles with Air Canada Rouge last week. We found the staff to be the nicest flight staff by far from all airlines we have travelled with before. We have flown multiple times with US Airways Air Canada and West Jet we found that Rouge was the friendliest by far. An example what the staff did for us if that they saw that we traveled with an infant the flight was completely full however the flight attendants get 3 reserved seats at the very back of the plane for them to rest they gave up this entire row so my daughter could sleep laying down on 2 seats and myself beside her. I usually don't write comments online but I see people always writing poor comments online I want people to read this and see that the staff do everything to make the flight the best for the passengers the seats are more tight however their service makes it worthwhile for me to fly with them again.
1570,The price difference between Singapore Airlines and Air China is not huge for SIN PEK. Check-in at Beijing was average. Did not receive clear direction to lounge. Hot food was finished by 830pm so had to go airport cafe for dinner. The male toilet smelled even though it looked clean. Had to take a bus to board the plane. No instruction as to which bus. Business class boarded after economy! Very long seat although the seat can be wider. Very comfortable lie flat bed as I slept 5 hours out of the 6 hour flight. The food was plentiful but not very good quality and drinks selection limited. The flight attendants were actually quite good and attentive but they lacked product knowledge as four staff unable to work out how to lift the TV screen and the economy passengers were let to rush into exit on disembarkation! As a 4-Star airline Air China is not on par with Thai Airways or Swiss International.
1571,SYD-PEK-LON-PEK-PVG-SYD in early October. The aircraft's deployed on all the legs of the journey were relatively new. Flight attendants pleasant and the inflight food was good. I had my ipad with me so did not check out the IFE. Toilets were regularly cleaned. Flight from PVG to SYD delayed 2 hours. The airline was $400 cheaper that its nearest rival on my preferred route. Will fly Air China again for the right price.
1572,I flew Air Canada a couple of times recently to Vancouver. It was a very enjoyable experience. The staff are very efficient at their work. In serving the meals they are very quick to serve as they have 4 people serving two for the meals and two later for the drinks. After the meal is done we didn't have to wait for long before they came to pick up the trays. I would take Air Canada for long haul flights. Air Canada's service is excellent!
1573,I booked my flight from Rome to Los Angeles with Air Canada which I have flown with before and enjoyed. It was not until I received my booking confirmation that I realized that the first leg of the trip (Rome to Montreal) was with Rouge and the second leg (Montreal to LA) was with regular AC. After having already committed I checked the reviews for Rouge and became startled. All of the negative comments had me dreading the trip. It is a long flight and to be cramped would suck. Much to my surprise and pleasure the seats were fine! Of course I have noticed that most of the negative reviews were for Airbus planes and we flew on a 767 but the seats were identical to the regular AC flight we took on our second leg. There was plenty of leg room. In fact there was more leg room on the Rouge flight than on the Lufthansa flight we took getting there. The seats were plenty wide. The staff were a little young but nice and cheerful. The food was great and plenty of it. I read so many bad things about the lack of inflight entertainment but then they played two recently released movies on the cabin televisions more than I got on my last American Airlines flight going the same route. Overall it was a great flight and experience. In fact it was much better than the second leg we flew on regular AC in that the staff sucked on the AC flight and they charged for snacks and food. The only thing better was the in flight entertainment was in the headrests which is always great. Bottom line I would definitely fly Rouge again and would recommend to friends.
1574,PEK-SZX. The outbound was a B747-400 business class was on the upper cabin. Staff service was excellent with good food. The inbound was an old B777-200 seat pitch was not satisfactory. But service and food were good.
1575,For the price from Australia to Europe return Air China is excellent value. But traveling through Beijing and a sneaky hidden stop over in Shanghai to your destination puts a sour taste in the mouth. For a start even though you are transiting through China to you're destination you must clear customs in both Shanghai and Beijing this process is 10/10 in the stress factor especially if you are a first time traveler via these cities. As this was our first European holiday my wife and I found out the hard way that cheap airfares are cheap for a reason. As for Air China as a carrier I can not complain the service was good food typical for an aircraft seats average for comfort in economy class entertainment good. If it wasn't for the headaches and stress in transiting through China I would most certainly use Air China again.
1576,SHA-PEK return First class (business but they sell the tickets domestically as first). The outbound was an A330-300 had comfortable flatbed. Inbound leg a Boeing 777-200 less space compared with A330 and the seat could not recline much. Flight was on time and was offered nice dim sum. The flight attendants were quite responsive.
1577,YYZ-YYT. Wonderful service! The cabin crew were extremely helpful when my Air Canada gift card wasn't working. They gave me my meal for free. The flight was great and the cabin crew together spoke 6 different languages. Thanks for another great trip Air Canada!
1578,"PEK-FRA on a very old B744. Actually I chose Air China just because other airlines are full. 744 had no personal TV for economy class so if you cannot sleep on a long haul flight please consider very carefully before booking. The seat is quite good it should be a 33~34"" pitch seat and I slept quite well during the flight. Two meals on the flight the first one was about 2 hours after take-off the second one was around 2.5 hours before landing. However if other airlines are available with not much disadvantage on price I will not choose Air China."
1579,SHA-PEK return. Inbound trip was with an A333 aircraft and the outbound was with B772 both wide-body jet but the latter has no fully flat bed. But considering the flight lasts less than 2 hours it's OK. The flight arrived on time and the services in the lounge and onboard were standard. Many domestic airlines offer Shanghai - Beijing route but I think Air China gives the best offering as far as both hardware and software are concerned.
1580,"Economy London Gatwick to Osaka via Beijing in mid-August and back via Beijing but to London Heathrow in early September. Cheaper than the others by Â£200 + a seat. Timings of flights excellent and quick with only 2 hour turnaround in Beijing. Planes Airbus A330-200 ok with 2-4-2 pattern. Seats no worse than many other airlines in economy - maybe an inch more than some. Food quality ok. Wine only served at end of main meal! Staff fine. Loos ok. Entertainment a bit limited and one seat back terminal ropey and you need the double mono adapter. Flights all pretty much on time. Beijing transfer is a bit tricky first time - go to the ""transfer passenger"" queue on the far right of all other queues looks slow but works ok then down escalator and back through security. We fly long haul every year sometimes several times and for the money and on this experience we thought Air China were fine."
1581,We flew Air Canada from Saskatoon to Honolulu via Vancouver. Flight on Air Canada Express from Saskatoon was delayed 1 hour due to supposed thunder storms in the area. Most of the passengers thought it was a faulty red light as there did not appear to be any weather in the area. Flight was very good and we arrived in Vancouver a little late. On both flights the service was excellent. Check in at Saskatoon was very quick and efficient. Flight to Honolulu was one of the best we have ever had. We enjoyed our preferred seating and the Air Canada Lounge in Vancouver.
1582,AC793 Rome-MTL Sep 15th. For the last 12-24 months our many experiences with Air Canada have been nothing but disappointing and far from a world class transporter standard. Both my husband and I are frequent flyers ( I personally take an average of 20 flights a year with Air Canada in North America or Overseas). I don't think it is normal that I have to clean the cabin (remove the cookie crumbs food) off my seat which is filthy stained clean the walls covered with spills and put my blanket on the seat to avoid having to change my clothing when I am heading off to a meeting. Those are things I had to do on my flight from Rome (and the same from Geneva London Paris) The last flight from Rome. The audio system was not working my tablet was broken and the overhead light of our entire row inoperative. We had paid for Business tickets and were standby so I paid an extra for preferred seat so I could have room for my injured knee the leg room was fine but I can tell you that the experience wherever you sit Economy or Business it is always the same: prepare a few napkins and sanitizer so I can have a decent place to sit before the flight. Staff had a condescending attitude!
1583,Flew Manchester UK to Toronto 6/8/2014 - returned 22/8/2014. Chose them because they had a good name did not realise it was not Air Canada and secondly price. Really good price for this time of year. The cabin crew were young I like their trendy uniform. I think the return journey crew were better than the outbound only because going they were asked questions about travel connections and should the passenger pick up their luggage or would it be transferred they did not know the answer. Also I think the return journey at night is easier for the crew because people sleep. I found the crew very attentive and very friendly they did not forgot requests from passengers. The downside of the flight - no duty free I did not realise this on my outward journey. The inflight entertainment I had read you could purchase a tablet for $10 which I did on my outward journey - the tablet kept freezing whilst I watched a film. I think it took me 3 hrs to watch the film. Other passengers also had problems. I did not purchase the tablet on the return journey but the same thing happened but they made an announcement that they rebuffed the machine and I think that did work but they didn't do this on the outward journey. The food was ok although I am not a fan of airline food and would of preferred a salad or a sandwich. These days it is hard for crew with food requirements there were a lot of different diets and it was not made easy when the passengers moved seats but they handled it very well. I would definitely travel with this airline again. My seats were fine I had leg room. Yes it is no frills but not everyone can afford luxury travel and also don't always rely on bad reviews. I was surprised how good my flights were.
1584,After 2 long flights SYD-Shanghai and Beijing to Rome in Business Class my wife and I were satisfied. The seat laid out completely flat and we were as comfortable as any airline we have travelled on. The meals were good in size and quantity but not exceptional. FA's were charming and responsive and their English was much better than my Chinese! The selection of movies and TV shows was more than adequate for us and the headsets comfortable. The toilets spotless and we were on time. Altogether a satisfactory experience.
1585,HKG - PEK - JFK and back. Check-in at Hong Kong International Airport was great. Flight from Hong Kong left on time and was quite comfortable. Landing in Beijing was on time. The main concern that I had was the customs / metal detector line where you pass through to the International Departures area. It was apparent from my observations that Air China has sold a lot of International to International flights going through Beijing Airport to the point where China Customs has too many international transfer people to check which leads to a delay. I wouldn't fault China Customs as they had every one of the four international transfer desks open. After customs an even bigger delay occurred at the metal detector area for International transfers which only had one of the two counters open. Because of the aforementioned delays I made it to my JFK flight just as it began boarding. My wife who flew two weeks after I did missed her connection to JFK because Hong Kong was in the midst of a typhoon. It took Air China a while to process her for the next day's flight and put her in a hotel. When my wife arrived at the hotel she was surprised to be informed that Air China was going to put her in a room with a roommate and subsequently paid an extra USD$24 to get her own room. Flying back from JFK was pleasant and we arrived on time in Beijing. There is no plug-in point for a laptop or iPad so my battery died halfway through the flight. The aircraft does not have personal screens in the Economy Section. After spending the night at the hotel located in the Departures Area of Beijing National Airport we had another pleasant flight back to Hong Kong. Overall a good experience. Would fly again if the airfare is competitive.
1586,Flew on Embraer 190 from SFO to YVR and have to say that the FA was absolutely the best I have experienced. Service was top notch. Had no problems with the inflight entertainment system either. If you are going to be flying executive first on EM190 try and book a seat on the left side of the cabin since you will have the half of the aircraft to yourself.
1587,FCO-YYZ Sep 25th. Instantaneous check-in quick security very good food 20 minute luggage arrival and an incredibly good crew. We have flown over 200 flights in the last 10 years on 14 airlines and this was the best crew ever. The premium seats were a bargain.
1588,YYZ-KIN-YYZ. Flew Air Canada's discount division Rouge to Kingston. Flight was packed on the outbound and boarding was chaotic due to passengers returning with copious purchases and multiple suitcases and carry-ons. Flight attendants are all new hires and so lack most of the basic skills expected of them. I purchased an extra leg room seat in one of the first four rows. Be aware that KIN check in agents will fill these seats with mothers and babies if you think you're getting a bit of respite. For purchase food selection was missing the healthy items inbound and outbound. Return flight was delayed 45 minutes when customer traveling with parent and 7 relatives including 3 newborns had not made proper arrangements for oxygen and crew struggled to deploy the onboard oxygen using FA manuals to sort out the issues. Lost connection meant 3 hour wait and midnight arrival in YOW. Rouge is not Westjet. Comments from customer below about her YUL to Athens flight neglected to mention that it too was a Rouge flight.
1589,Dublin - Toronto return. After all the bad reviews I've read about Rouge I was quite apprehensive when the holiday started. We were pleasantly surprised that our trip turned out to be one of the best yet. The seats we were given were the middle seats no 15 and my son and I discovered that there was a USB charger. And because I prepared for our trip we were armed with our ipads complete with the apps. We also noticed that our seats had bigger leg room unfortunately the ones behind us had less. Why this is I don't know. Did we pay a bit more so that we were afforded this comfort? We were also assigned no 13 seats on our return flight so we were anticipating a comfortable ride but we were fortunately upgraded to premium Rouge so it was even so much better! Can't explain this either but I'm not complaining! Food was not the best but reasonable the premium rouge was not that much better but was ok. Drinks were constantly offered in our outbound journey no alcohol though. In premium alcohol was free but it was the cheap kind. Nothing different from what other airlines offer. Air hostesses and stewards friendly and helpful the toilets were relatively clean so nothing to complain about really! Check in both ways were easy boarding was ok. The plane was late 1 hr coming back but we had a 6 hr wait for our connection so no worries there! I'll fly Rouge anytime but maybe pay the high(ish) fare?
1590,Star Alliance Gold Million Miler. I recently flew from Los Angeles to Montreal on Air Canada connecting to my Rome flight on Rouge. I must tell you I was terrified to fly Rouge after reading all the reviews. I was seated in Row 27 directly behind the Exit Row with 2 seats next to the window. I will start by saying that the experience on Rouge was good and comparable to other airlines in Coach Cabin (not preferred Seating or Economy plus). The recline was average and leg room fine I am 5'7' and was able to stretch my leg under the seat. The flight was full and the crew did a nice job with meal and drink service. I would definitely flew them again not my first choice but will fly them again if necessary. They did recognize my Star Alliance status and early boarding.
1591,Business class London Gatwick to Beijing to Ulaanbaatar Mongolia. The new-ish business class lounge at Gatwick (North Terminal) is excellent for a short stay but perhaps not the best if you have a 3 or four hour lay-over. Aircraft was A330-200 seat 13L. Cabin was a little tired but was still in reasonable condition. The seat cushions were a little firm but the space and width were reasonable. I was worried that the full recline/flat bed was not actually going to be flat but it was and was very comfortable for a sleep. Supplied also with pyjamas and quilt for a snooze. Staff very attentive and there was no need to request drinks or top- ups as these were forthcoming throughout the flight. The Chinese meal was good but a little tasteless. A bit more variety and freshness may have improved it a bit. The AVOD completely froze for my seat and was never rectified throughout. However glancing at the programmes and films on offer I did not miss much as it was very dated. Punctuality excellent. Beijing T3 is not the easiest to change flights within and there is no channels for business class to speed up the process. As there were several flights arriving there was a very long queue of at least 200 waiting for the immigration check (although it was just a check to then be allowed in to the area for security - where there was another queue). Flight to UB was fine - with only 8 business class seats and two staff for the section we were very well looked after.
1592,Flew PEK-FNJ on a B737-200. Seating was pretty cramped. Even though it was a short flight drinks and a snack-box was served. 2nd run through was made for drink top-ups. No IFE. FA's were cordial. All-in-all a decent enough experience.
1593,YYZ-NRT-YVR using B777 / A330 in Executive First. Trip started off nice enough but ended in a cancellation and a forced delay of 1 day. I flew off peak hours so I benefited from a quick check-in with a personable agent. The YYZ-NRT boarding was the usual rush of pax. It would be nice if AC moved the priority lane to one side and it was better labelled so people don't accuse priority boarders of pushing in the line. Not a full flight so FAs had an opportunity to take their time and provide decent service. Food and beverages better than usual and overall I have noticed AC has shown some improvement in its food quality in the past year. Unfortunately the wine selection is still hit and miss. The seat showed its age and was well used. The IFE selection was boring and I resent the forced commercials. It was a good flight and I was able to catch a few hours of sleep. The problem was with the return flight. It was cancelled due to equipment issues. It happens but it seems to be an increasing scenario at AC. The AC response to the issue was disorganized and slow. Personnel tried their best. The end result was hours wasted at the airport until AC sent Pax off to a hotel. Communication was poor. The concierge in NRT was professional although it took some time to get an answer. The lady in YVR who assisted was also professional and kind. Unfortunately the replacement flight the next day was also beset by equipment issues as the air conditioning system wasn't working well and the cabin was stuffy and hot for the flight to YVR. However FAs on this flight were the best I have had on AC. I seem to be encountering an increasing number of equipment issues and delays with AC. I have only recently started using the airline again on my long hauls and I am not particularly impressed by this aspect of its operations.
1594,My family and I flew Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to Athens Aug 5th and back Aug 21st. I was satisfied with the flight and service. Rouge is a discount airline. That means slightly smaller seats less leg room and paying extra for anything beyond the basics (like liquor). Rouge delivered value for what I paid. The staff are young pleasant and did a good job. The inflight entertainment worked well. The fact that you need to bring your own device was communicated to us twice by the airline prior to departure and there are plugs to charged your devices on the flight. The food was as good as any economy class food that I've had.
1595,Flew from Incheon to Singapore return via Beijing. We were given a free upgrade to first class on the first leg of the journey which I can't complain about but the apart from that the airline is rather disappointing. Both of the flights on the way to Singapore were delayed by about 3 hours. The economy food was very poor; the beer and wine undrinkable; and the service was minimalistic. The crew seemed to have a very low level of English. They only offered drinks other than water once during the five hour flight from Beijing to Singapore and even water was not offered enough. There was no entertainment on the 5 hour flights to and from Singapore. Air China is cheap but it can really only be compared with other low-cost airlines.
1596,Madrid-Beijing A330 and Beijing-Frankfurt B747 in August. Both flights left on time and arrived earlier than scheduled. Check-in and boarding was fast and efficient at both airports. Daylight flight from Madrid to Beijing. Small leg space in the A330 and cabin seemed old. Inflight entertainment was basic (small TV in each seat) consisting of 4/5 movies (2 Chinese + 2/3 English). Cabin crew was efficient but service was basic. Food was simple (2 lunch options but when it got to our row only one dish was available as they ran out of chicken). They served 2 meals. Red eye flight from Beijing to Frankfurt. Greater than usual leg space in the B747. Cabin seemed old but was clean. Inflight entertainment was very basic (1 large screen for each economy class section). Cabin crew was efficient and their English level was good. Food was simple but tasty (2 meals served). Good value for money.
1597,LAX-YYZ upgraded to executive class. Number 1 staff in the industry. AC still holds standards high for FA appearance. This crew was most professional and looks the best in North America. Keep it going AC and you will get awards for North-American airline on top of your international awards. IFE didn't function in my seat staff however did everything possible to keep me comfy.
1598,NRT-YYZ on Sep 16. There was a supposedly a typhoon in Tokyo so flight was delayed 2 hours. I think the food is getting worse since my last flight! One of the offerings was a mini sandwich with simply cucumber and mayonnaise. The apples for breakfast did not look fresh. They were brown already so it was not appetizing! Air Canada's IFE is good lots of good movies to choose from! Cabin crew is where Air Canada really need to improve on their international flights! Although at least 70% of the crew were very pleasant there are some of the older ladies who just seemed like they were above it all. One hostess was emotionless when distributing food she just put it straight on our table and left.
1599,AC Jazz and Express from YTZ-YQB via YUL was a breeze in spite of heavy fog and two cancellations the ground staff at Billy Bishop Airport was very helpful and respectful to passengers. AC Jazz from YQB to YYZ was smooth and the flight attendants were great. It was a smooth and pleasant flight back to Toronto.
1600,I flew from Toronto (YYZ) to Venice (VCE) on the 767-300ER. Rouge is simple but still provided a pleasant flight. Leg room not bad at all. Flight attendants were all female and young. Hot meal served but alcohol costs money. No video screens but who cares when you have a good-looking crew to look at.
1601,Very mediocre experience and an airline I'll be avoiding in the future. I was flying direct London to Beijing but the quality was worse than some domestic Chinese flights I've taken. I had to change seats a grand total of 4 times. Each time because my inflight entertainment system wasn't working and it wasn't until my fourth seat that the screen was working. During this time the stewards and stewardesses were co-operative in helping me find a seat but not kind or apologetic in any way. As for the food the quality of the Chinese meal was somewhat better than the Western meal but neither especially good. My main complaint about the Western meal was the lack of vegetables and meat. The service was perfunctory and the stewardesses stern and at times rude. I just think they have no concept of what customer service is. They warmed to me slightly as I speak Mandarin and was travelling by myself. All in all Air China will get you from A to B and the stewardesses will bring you your food and drinks but whether or not you have a relaxing enjoyable flight is another matter. Wouldn't recommend them and would prefer to pay extra or fly to China indirect next time to avoid them.
1602,Kunming-Shanghai Hongqiao on B738 Beijing-Shanghai Hongqiao on A332 both on time for departure and arrival. Aircraft's are new and clean comfortable seat and spacious legroom blanket was given which was appreciated for domestic flights. Food and drinks acceptable. Overall enjoyable experience with Air China for domestic travel.
1603,Latest flight YVR-YYZ. Flight was overbooked (as usual) therefore it took awhile before I got my seat. No food despite the fact it is a 4.5 hour flight. Airplane was old seats were not leather. No complaints about the crew. TV screen in the seat in front so that was good. Ticket price - $335 OW if purchased RT - no discount. Barely any legroom.
1604,"I knowingly booked on AC Rouge YVR-SFO because that's the only flight which worked with my schedule. Flight was delayed one hour but that's due to SFO runway construction/inbound restrictions. We were kept updated so no complaints there. In all fairness the in-flight service was no better or worse than any mainline AC short-haul service (that is serviceable without wow factor.) Where they really fall down is the lack of legroom. 29"" pitch felt rather claustrophobic and I'm not even tall. Be warned if you're anything over 5'5"". I did appreciate one of the pilots standing by the door thanking passengers upon disembarking. All in all for an 1 hr 50 flight it really was quite okay and I'd do the same flight with AC Rouge in the future. Any longer I don't think I'll ever go for based on seat discomfort alone. P.S. we were only offered a small cup of juice/pop/water but for such a short flight I really don't give a toss."
1605,YYZ-MCO. This is basically a budget airline so with that in mind it wasn't bad. My main criticism was the terrible legroom - I would suggest they fix the seats in the upright position as the European budget carriers do because when someone reclines it really is very uncomfortable.
1606,Hong Kong to Beijing flight was a little late leaving but made the time up. Plane was an airbus looked tired from the outside but fine inside. Some of the PA announcements were lost in translation but the crew were friendly and helpful food was OK alcohol needed to be purchased entertainment just local Chinese television. I would use them again in this part of the world.
1607,London-Beijing-Taipei. Flight was about Â£200 cheaper than any of the other airlines were offering. I flew Air France to Shanghai last year and actually Air China compared quite favourably - there wasn't the same degree of choice with the inflight entertainment but the food was just as good and seats were probably more comfortable. You aren't provided with a takeaway 'pack' of things on this flight but there is a pillow and blanket on your seat and there are headphones for entertainment. The toilets were fine (yes they did get a bit gross towards the end but that happens on an 11 hour flight) and the staff were accommodating. My veggie meal wasn't on their list on the first leg of the outward bound journey but when I showed them my confirmation email they found me one without any fuss. Service at the check-in desks was also perfectly fine. The long haul planes had a personal television and were pretty full. The shorter flights (Beijing-Taipei) had communal screens with Chinese TV on them but weren't very full - on the way back I got a whole row of seats to myself!
1608,Flight from YYC to IAH in Executive Class was just OK. Food was horrible but the flight service director did his job well. Flight from CUN to YYC in Executive Class was one of the best flights I've been on. The food on this segment was much better but what made is so great was the cheerfulness and helpfulness of the flight service director. Drinks were always topped up and staff made sure everyone was comfortable and asked if there was anything else they needed even though it was a full flight. A pleasant surprise from Air Canada.
1609,Had a very good experience flying from London Heathrow to Toronto via Chicago on 23/8/13. Everything from booking the flight customer service before flight and during flight checking in boarding aircraft comfort on board good connecting service and the same on direct return flight everything was great. Competitive price as well.
1610,"Return JFK-PEK. Economy. Full flights on time. Food was not brilliant but certainly edible. Cabin crew attentive and cheerful. Plenty of beverages and cold water in between meals. Wine and beer available at no extra charge. Seats comfortable even for my 6'3"" husband. 744 seating felt roomier than 747. Movie screen a little hard to see for short people. In truth most travelers had tablets or laptops playing their own movies or TV shows. Not much variety in sound system entertainment but again most people were listening to their own MP3 players or iPods. Bathrooms neat and clean. Whole experience comparable to United return to Beijing several years ago."
1611,MUC-PEK-HKG-PEK-MUC over June and July 2012. Check-in at MUC handled very professionally by Lufthansa. Assigned a bulkhead seat from MUC-PEK. Legroom is therefore excellent. Cabin crew spoke very poor English and showed little enthusiasm. The food is nothing extraordinary - portions were small and bland. IFE is AVOD with a reasonable section. PEK-HKG operated by a wet-leased Air Macau A320 - no IFE same mechanical service and poor food options. Service on return leg was mediocre. The excellent IFE hardware with touch screens cannot make up for the lack of film and TV options. Food worse than outbound and the white wine almost undrinkable. Overall a cheap way to get from A to B but don't expect much in the service department.
1612,ADB-IST-YYZ-YUL return in economy on 14 August. First flight on Turkish from Izmir code share. Even though a code share flight they couldn't give me my AC boarding passes and told me my luggage would go through to Montreal but I had to check in at AC in Istanbul. Too many people scheduled to be an A320 switched to a A340 at last minute leading to delays leaving Izmir. Arrived in Istanbul we were taken to a remote stand and finally bussed to the domestic terminal. Dashed to the international terminal reps for AC were waiting all smiles and no problems got my two remaining boarding passes. Massive line at immigration control to leave. I went to the front and asked some people if they would let me go ahead as my flight had already started to board. Just made it to my flight to Toronto. Once on board a perfect as a flight in economy could be. Excellent flight attendants professional and friendly. Drinks then a wonderful meal of lamb. Plenty of water runs snack part way through self service drinks and snacks in galley. Another meal 1.5 hrs before landing chicken again excellent. B767 had been refurbished excellent seats comfortable and entertainment system first rate with plenty of choices. Bags didn't make it to YYZ Turkish Airlines fault but AC was very good about getting them to me in Ottawa to my hotel 2 days later. Transfer to YUL smooth good short flight. Return flights again on AC from YUL-YYZ-IST on 23 Aug very good great service by caring crew as outbound. Equipment change again in IST to ADB on THY code share seat changed. Flight short and ok. Overall Air Canada has a great product as I have flown this route over the last 10 years using Turkish Airlines Air France KLM and Lufthansa. The price I paid was cheaper then the rest the flight attendants are what made the difference so nice and accommodating as well as good food for economy. I will keep using AC now that they are flight to IST from Canada.
1613,YVR-YOW-YVR. Breakfast flight to Ottawa on an Airbus 320. I had breakfast in the AC lounge and it was good the wireless needs to be upgraded as it was very slow and the YVR wireless was much faster. Our FA on the flight was very attentive and the breakfast service was excellent. Delayed 45 minutes landing in Ottawa due to a thunderstorm. On my return journey I enjoyed my stay in the lounge with good food and a glass of quality wine but again the wireless was slow and I gave up using it. The return flight was an Airbus 319. There was only one FA with us in the front cabin and she did the best she could being short handed with a full cabin. She was friendly and otherwise I enjoyed my trip. The meal was excellent and she offered a special liqueur service which was appreciated by many in the front cabin. My other suggestion is that on the IFE you get more documentaries old comedy TV shows and classic films. These must be reasonably inexpensive. Because I travel so much with them I sometimes run out of choices. However for both I paid an executive class fare and I got good value for what I paid.
1614,Flight and crew on flight to/from Toronto to Dublin was very good. Confused though since provided wine free on flight to Dublin but charged on the return leg. Seat was broken (would not lock in upright position). Biggest complaint / issue is that Airline allows carry on baggage regardless of size which jammed up overhead storage. One case had to be removed to close bin and was stored by crew in the back. This should be enforced for comfort of all.
1615,YXE-YYZ-DUB-CPH CPH-YYZ-YXE in economy. Paid an excellent price for this route. Flight to Toronto uneventful good service flights on time. Air Canada is my first choice for transatlantic flying but after 2 flights in my itinerary I will definitely reconsider especially the one to Dublin. It's not that the flight was uncomfortable the entire experience was just average. Flight attendants seemed uninterested and the plane was probably the oldest in the fleet. The arm rest of my seat had something that looked like industrial-strength foil holding parts together. I think this flight is over-looked since it is a seasonal route. This route is also being transferred to Rouge next year so maybe it'll improve. CPH-YYZ absolutely no problem newer aircraft friendly flight crew. Boarding at CPH was somewhat interesting - over 200 people left to sit in the hallway and departure lounge only opened shortly before boarding. YYZ-YXE late leaving YYZ due to an issue with the cargo door. No problem - safety first. Next time: Lufthansa!
1616,I flew YYZ-WAW with a stop in FRA. The YYZ-FRA portion was operated by an AC 777-300 aircraft. This was on July 23 2013. I was happy with the service I received. I did on-line check-in and printed my boarding pass prior to arriving at the airport. To print my baggage tags I went to the check-in kiosk but the kiosk unfortunately did not want to print out all my tags meaning I could not go to the quick express bag-drop queue. This wasn't really a problem though because as a Star Alliance Gold customer I can use the quick Executive Class check-in queue to drop off my baggage. Check-in agent Heather was very nice and friendly! She actually gave me individual attention to the fact that my baggage should be labelled as fragile. I then went past security and with a friend I went to the Maple Leaf / Star Alliance Gold lounge. Lounge had a calming and not too busy atmosphere very pleasant and recommended! The flight itself was great! Cabin crew were attentive (although not the very friendliest AC cabin crew I have encountered but still very good) and the in-flight entertainment options were actually I think the best part of the flight. My pre-ordered vegetarian meal came quickly and in general it was a good flight!
1617,Business/Economy class CDG-PEK-PVG-CDG. CDG-PEK on 777-300ER business class a prized flatbed which is great for a 10 hours flight. My welcome drink was snatched away before I could finish it. Food was plentiful but taste awful. IFE froze and was rebooted 3 times. Crew was robotic. PEK-PVG on A340 in economy. Uncomfortable seat no personal IFE. Crew good for economy class standard. They did 2 rounds of drinks and each PAX was given a tasteless muffin with a fried egg inside. PVG-CDG on 340 Business class old style business class seat and I found myself sliding down the seat the whole night. It was supposed to be angled flat but I would call it flat with bumps. The crew asked me if I would like a welcome drink and handed me a food and drink menu. I ordered red wine and was told that red wine bottle would be opened only after takeoff. Crew service was a little impersonal but did perform their work professionally. Ground service efficient - quick check-in meet and greetings hostess efficient to/from airport-hotel limousine transfers offered. If you find yourself flying Air China business make sure it is on their 777-300ER.
1618,LHR-PEK return in economy. Did the same journey last year this time it was slightly less enjoyable due to the seats I was in on the A330. On both legs 46J and 46L had a dodgy IFE whereas it appeared the rest of the plane was having no problems. Both legs had old interior/IFE seat material was uncomfortable legroom was ok for a small person like myself taller people may have problems. Food wasn't top notch but they still give you 2 full meals. Flight attendants do plenty of drink runs and were friendly. Outbound flight landed 30 mins early inbound landed on time. Will probably fly again as prices and schedules suit me.
1619,SYD-PEK. The seats entertainment and service were all very average. The food was edible but not enjoyable. However it was easily the cheapest flight on offer as far as value for money goes it was all about what you would expect.
1620,Melbourne to Shanghai then onto London return. Booked Air China due to them being $1500 less than any other flights to the UK. The food entertainment and service weren't top class but for the price they were good. We had to transfer between flights at Shanghai but staff helped us with every aspect. Due to reading the comments on here we were prepared with our own snacks and some entertainment which I would advise. Would definitely fly them again.
1621,Flew on Rouge from Toronto to Montego Bay and back. Great flight attendants and staff. I am a 6ft average male and the seats are slightly more cramped than I'm used to on Air Canada but on my last vacation on Westjets and previously Sunwing are no better or seats were about the same. Flight was on time both ways and I enjoyed the wifi streaming of movies and music on my iPad. Food for sale on board was fresh and lots of choice. Overall I felt very safe and that's the most important thing.
1622,Hong Kong-Paris via Beijing. Price of this trip was excellent. The first 3 flights were on comfortable planes while the final leg from Beijing to HKG was on an old leased Air Macau plane which was rather cramped. Food isn't great but flights were on time and the air hostesses excellent. Movie selection is spartan but I took an ipod so didn't mind. The one curious policy is that Air China keep the fasten seat belt signs on throughout the flights. Would certainly fly again if price remains at least $HK 1500 lower than its competitors.
1623,SFO-PEK in economy. Rebooked on CA after UA delay. In terms of seating not enough legroom but was made better because flight was relatively empty and my wife and I had an extra seat between us. Food was low average about the same standards as UA economy transpacific flights. Their wine selection was small and there were no spirits offered. Soft drink selection very minimal as well. Plane was uncomfortably warm but FAs did turn down the temperature after I requested. Entertainment was on the big screen and mostly Chinese programming. Their domestic flights w/in china are very comfortable with excellent service but their international flights are very bare-boned.
1624,ATH-MUC-PEK-MUC-ATH on time A332. The older a/c had bad IFE with only 6 movies and no feet support. Seats comfortable pillow and blanket supplied but no amenities pouch. The flight attendants made the difference - fluent in English and eager to help. There were 2 selections of food Western and Asian.
1625,I took AC Rouge for the first time yesterday from Dublin to Toronto with my wife and two children. Having read all of the negative comments on this and other sites I was prepared for the worst. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. First class it is not but neither are the fares. Inflight staff were great service was outstanding food was so-so but certainly edible. I have certainly had many better flights but I have had many worse flights as well. They are good value for money and I will fly them again. As for the in flight entertainment we are pretty tech savvy and I like old and obscure films so it was great but it may not suit everyone.
1626,"HKG-BJS on A321. Old looking plane but was clean and modern on the inside similar to domestic travel in Australia. Delayed on the ground in HKG for 2 hours due to ""cargo loading"" but made up time in the air. Crew were friendly but didn't speak English."
1627,Vancouver to Beijing return in economy. My vegetarian meal was quite good and the service good. Pillows and blankets provided as were earphones. The downside being the movies were not on demand and as such I did not watch them. Both flights on time. My only complaint would be the lack of on demand video and I would suggest the bathroom floors be mopped (this seems to be an issue on all long haul flights I have been on).
1628,Vancouver to Hong Kong Via Beijing. Seating was comfortable food good and the stewardess polite. Our flight leaving Vancouver was delayed 3 hours so could not make our connecting flight to HKG. Arrangements made for free accommodation in Beijing. When we got to Beijing the transfer station misdirected us. Afterwards I found out there was an Air China official looking after other passengers who were also delayed. We had to wait another 2-3 hours for other delayed passengers to pick up their luggage. It seems that Air China need to improve procedures to deal with delayed passengers in Beijing.
1629,Beijing to Shanghai. Only one check-in desk for standby passengers. Flight time was 2 hours. Hot meals served and no options. The A/C was B777 without IFE system. Crew were helpful. Flight was on time. Shanghai to Beijing B747 without IFE. One hot bun served as breakfast. Flight delayed 45 minutes due to air traffic control.
1630,"Took the inaugural flight from Montreal to Athens on a Rouge 767. I was expecting the worst given the extremely bad reviews given here but surprisingly it turned out to be a rather pleasant flight that was pretty much on par with any of the many long-haul AC flights I have taken in the past. Seating and legroom were equivalent to regular AC flights (I am 5 '11"") and the food was even a bit better quality (although portions were slightly smaller). Wifi-based entertainment system seems to be Apple-centric and did not work properly with my Android tablet although movies were shown on the overhead screens. Departed from the domestic terminal in YUL which was a bit odd. Based on the other reviews I see I would guess that the experience on the transatlantic flights on the 767 is markedly better than NA flights on the A319."
1631,"London to Sydney return via Beijing. A cheap flight and lived up to cheap expectations. Very friendly check-in at Heathrow and Sydney. Chinese staff do not speak much English. Meal selection was ""Chinese"" or ""Western"" with menus offered on only Heathrow-Beijing and Beijing-London sections. No snacks in between meals and no amenity bag. Drinks were revolting - no ice and tea is warm and stewed black tea. Coffee has milk powder to add. Announcements in English impossible to understand Captains' English was good on all flights. Overall it lived up to expectations with good entertainment and the food was okay. Due to poor English and lack of assistance from staff I would not recommend or fly again with this airline."
1632,We flew Rouge from Venice to Toronto on May 25th. The flight had mechanical problems which certainly can't be forecast. Hence we were about 5.5 hours late. The crew was delightful they did what they're supposed to do about the delay. The praise stops there. The seats were unbearably uncomfortable and we were in the Economy Plus section. Our leg room was fine it was the seat itself that was the problem. The poor folks behind us were packed in like sardines. This is the first 767-300 I've ever seen with 53 rows of seats. My wife and I both got swollen legs even though we got up and walked frequently. I don't think we'll choose Rouge again.
1633,When people book Air Canada flights and pay full price they should be told that they will be flying Rouge so that they have the choice to decline. The seats were very uncomfortable there was no TV and the plane really looked decrepid. The flight attendants seemed to just be an extension of the the whole sad situation. I have flown Air Canada since the 50's and was always proud of our Canadian airline. I find it a shame that we do no longer compete with other fine airlines of the world. From now on unless it is an extreme emergency I will never fly Air Canada again.
1634,"I was on an Air Canada Rouge flight from Venice to Toronto May 2014. The plane had no TV's and customers are expected to download an air Canada app in advance to their own smart phones i pads etc. They rent ipads for those without their own. The stewardess spent much of of the trip trying to trouble shoot problems with access to the system. Most people gave up and spent 10 hours with nothing to watch. That makes for a very long flight and makes the assumption that everyone is travelling with such a mobile device and wants to watch tv on their phone screen. This is not good customer service for such long flights. Also unless you had accessed the app before your flight it would not run movies or TV shows. Despite over an hour delay taking off in Venice to Toronto no Air Canada rep bother to advise travellers to download it in advance from the Venice airport internet service. Also there are no ""new releases"" in the movie options. The movies are ""classics"" and as old as the ruins in Rome. The flight was late back into Toronto and we were given incorrect info from the crew as to the gate for our flight connection in Toronto and we had to complete our journey standby."
1635,I paid for an Air Canada fare from Halifax to Barbados. Toronto-Barbados portion was on Rouge. What a horribly plane. Luckily even with our flight almost full there was no one in the center seat. I am 6ft 1in I had to have my left leg over in the middle seat and my right leg into the aisle to get any measure of comfort and needless to say that was uncomfortable for 5hrs 45 mins. It actually made more sense for me to stand up during the flight. And the lack of individual monitors? Renting iPAds to watch movies? That's a curse in itself. The staff tried to be very helpful but how can they help you get more room when there is none.
1636,"I am only 5'8"" and my knees touched the seat in front. Anyone 5'10"" or over will not be able to fit in these seats without angling their legs. Staff young and friendly but inexperienced and their cavalier attitudes did not sit well after being cramped for a few hours. I purchased AC flights but was ""Rouged"" with no compensation. Air Canada was really improving the last few years and has taken a huge turn for the worse."
1637,"I booked a ticket from Calgary to Anchorage with a stopover in Vancouver and like many other commentators on here got my flight switched from Air Canada to Rouge to Anchorage (YVR-ANC). Fortunately I was sitting in the ""bulkhead row"" of economy otherwise my knees would have been going into the seat in front me. On both the flight there and back (3 hours) the flight attendants came through once to serve drinks and offer food. I found their cheery attitude even more annoying given that the service they gave was subpar. When I checked in they had an offer to ""upgrade"" to premium rouge on this flight for $300 (which I did not opt to do). You get more leg room and 2 free checked bags but that's about it since the seats are as narrow as economy. Getting free cheap booze and an okay meal is not worth that kind of money."
1638,As someone who is over 6 feet and 220 pounds the only word I can use to describe Air Canada Rouge seating is inhumane. I can live with wireless movies no meals and pay for baggage but I do need a seat I can sit in without skinning my knees. I can honestly say Rouge seating is the worst I have had to endure.
1639,"Great vacation except we were put on Air Canada Rouge flights by Air Canada (Toronto-cancun and back)- even though our original booking was on Air Canada. We were not given a choice or told of the change or what the change would mean (and it did not equate to any kind of discount). I have never been so cramped on a plane - I'm only 5'5"" and my knees touched the back of the next chair when it was reclined - I couldn't lift my purse from under the seat in front (and bags bigger then a purse will not fit under the seat). My husband is 5'10 and couldn't fit his legs in front of him so had to encroach on my space. The person to my left was over 6' and also encroached on my space - claustrophobic. The first thing the flight attendant said to me as I reached my seat was ""do you like the legroom"" and laughed. One of the bathrooms was out of order for the flight. There are no movies unless you purchase a tablet for $10. We didn't try any of the purchased food so can't comment about it. Added to all this - originally we booked a 2 hour layover back from Mexico in Toronto to have time make it through customs and having to go through security again before connecting flights (sadly happens at TO airport)- our ""itinerary"" change to a rouge flight lowered this to not much more than an hour. Flight crew very friendly and young and inexperienced. This has put a very bad taste in our mouth re: Air Canada who we have flown dozens of times with in the past. We mentioned it on our air Canada trip home and it seems that others feel the same."
1640,I've been Rouged! Low cost really? I paid for an AC flight and got Rouged. I didn't receive any refund as it was the the same price as an AC flight. Business class is a joke. Don't waste your money as the only difference is you get 2 checked bags and a meal. Seats are 3x3 with no one in the middle. Why put the 3rd seat in? Entertainment is worse than before. I have 2 more flights that have been Rouged and then never again.
1641,"I just flew Rouge for the first and likely the last time YUL- CAN. The first thing you notice are the seats. I am 6'0"" tall and found the seats to be very cramped uncomfortable and claustrophobic. If the person in front of you chooses to recline your eye-to-seatback distance becomes very small. This situation may be barely tolerable for flights under 2 hrs but for the 4.5 hrs to CAN it was tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment. The next thing you notice is that there is no traditional entertainment system. It is WiFi only and currently appears limited to iPad and some Windows devices. I have an Android tablet and therefore was not able to access their movie selection. What is surprising here is that an entertainment system that is designed around a bring-your-own-device concept provides no AC or USB access to power/charge your device. You also notice the ""fun"" attitude of the crew seems forced and disingenuous."
1642,"I travelled on AC/Rouge inaugural flight 02 May Dublin/Toronto in economy class. Much to my surprise this was on a new B767 My first class seat got transferred to Air Canada Rouge version of first class from Los Angeles to Vancouver BC which is a joke. This was done without my permission and without refunding any difference. They have 3 economy seats in the first class cabin on either side of the aisle and just do not sell the middle seat. The seats are narrow and uncomfortable. I feel like they are cheating first class passengers by selling economy seats in ""first class"". They provided a meal but that hardly covers the $500 plus cost difference from an economy seat."
1643,I travelled on AC/Rouge inaugural flight 02 May Dublin/Toronto in economy class. Much to my surprise this was on a new B767 with wingtips and a good crew and the food was good too except for those awful wraps on the second meal service. Seating was normal and didn't feel cramped. The crew were fun and always around to help. The problems with Rouge seems to be on the A319 domestic/transborder flights as I have nothing to complain about on the B767 International flights.
1644,"These seem to be very old aircraft repainted though refurbished with the slim line seats which are perfect for slim line passengers - which I am not even though only 5'3"" my knees are touching the seat in front. In the washrooms the doors still had an old metal ashtray. Crew is apparently paid to smile and be friendly. But after a half hour sitting on the runway they disappear and reappear when it's time to sell the $10 chicken wraps. I don t mind getting a low-cost carrier but if I don't get the low cost what is the use?"
1645,My wife got Rouged today paid for an AC seat got moved to Rouge without permission or compensation old planes poor leg room no power no food she can eat no options. She has to fly it to get home then we're WestJet and Delta out of Buffalo from now on. I'll be getting Rouged on Monday when I join her in Vegas WestJet from now on.
1646,My husband and I planned a nice trip to Cuba with Air Canada Vacations - Toronto to Varadero and back in March. Everything was great - except for the flights on AC Rouge. We are both tall and were hideously cramped in the tiny Rouge seats. The food was expensive and terrible if I'd known how bad it was I would have taken my own. Both flights were crammed and on the way back we were not seated together and were seated in the middle of a huge group of high-school students. Fortunately the kids were pretty well-behaved. I am now going to Las Vegas and my flights have been Rouged even though we thought we were going with the real Air Canada. I am a frequent flyer and will stick with AC because I like the lounge and use the points - but they are going to hear from me about Rouge. As others have said it's a bait-and-switch. The late NationAir was better than Rouge - and they were awful!
1647,"Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to Barbados on May 12th. The worst flight of my life! I am only 5'2"" and I have to say it was tight for me. The seats recline about 4 inches in total. When the person in front of my seat reclined the back of the seat was in my face! I felt sorry for the fellow in the window seat who was over 6' tall. I really don't know how he managed for the 5hr plus flight. His legs were stretched out the entire time so that he could fit into the seat. 2 guys behind me were hacking and coughing for the entire flight (not the fault of Rouge - but they should have worn masks or not be allowed on the plane). The staff was great and were cheerful throughout the entire flight. The overhead luggage bins are smaller than those on other planes. Then I discovered one of the reasons the bin space was further limited was that the crew had at least 3 of their bags in the bins so the paying customers had even less space for their items. I hope that reviews like this will be taken into consideration and that Rouge is not used on flights to Barbados. Also the seats were hard and uncomfortable. For 2 days since the flight my back and neck have been in a terrible state. I will not fly Air Canada again between Barbados and Toronto until more comfortable planes are in use."
1648,"They are now the only AC option from Calgary to Vegas which I fly 6 to 8 times a year. Awful experience with Rouge on my last and hopefully only flight with them (Westjet here I come). I am only 5' 7"" and my knees were just about touching the back of the seat in front of me. I did bring my fully charged ipad to view the entertainment. Unlike regular AC flight which offer the latest movies the selection consisted of old movies most of which I had already seen. The image was often grainy reflecting the poor streaming quality of the WIFI. Staff extremely young and inexperienced and no i do not need their false cheeriness!"
1649,My wife and I were on AC 590 from Phoenix to Toronto May 5 when we were told at check in that there were aircraft problems. Much later it came out that the plane was inoperable but instead of another AC plane they had to find a Rouge plane-which they did in San Diego so it went to Toronto then Phoenix so a 10 hour delay for us. The ground crew said they have fielded nothing but complaints since Rouge started. This was just the latest. I am a million mile for life AC client and my wife is super elite for the last 3 years. The Rouge experience is bad - no leg room limited overhead baggage room (more people same space) no entertainment system and every flight we have been on leaves late. It is the overhead baggage that creates the problems. At one point Rouge did not allow the same aeroplan point saving until clients complained and it was changed. Whoever came up with this concept did not consider their current clients. The price of tickets is the same and now Westjet will fly from Toronto to Phoenix beginning in the fall and they will take AC customers for sure. Rouge started with the short hauls and leg room can be tolerated for 2 hours but now they are on long hauls. Dressing the crew in designer clothing will not overcome these issues and in fact this situation is not fare to these staff and ground personal that are handling these complaints.
1650,"Last week I flew Air Canada Rouge for the first time not realizing the difference from Air Canada when I made the booking. The leg room is absolutely ridiculous. I took a picture while seated. My hand reached from my seat to the one in front of me and I don't have big hands. Service was lackadaisical. I asked for coffee but was told it couldn't be served as the seat belt sign was on which is understandable. On ""real"" Air Canada flights this has happened to me and the flight attendant has brought coffee once the light goes off but not on Rouge. Rouge is not recommended unless the price is really great."
1651,LAS-YYC. I never brought my iPad and it would not have mattered due to the fact that the system didn't function. I was travelling on my own on this trip but had I had my children it would have been even worse. We travel quite frequently but only have 1 iPad so I guess we will have to rent them now for the rest of the family. I also see we can't use them for the first 20 mins or the last 20 mins either. Why bother to watch a movie on a 2-3 hr flight as you would never get to see it all. No more place to charge devices either. Air Canada had a pretty good thing going and now it has taken a turn for the worse again. Whom ever thought up Rouge was obviously not the sharpest knife in the drawer. These types of major changes should have been piloted properly and reviews taken seriously. Very disappointed!
1652,Short hop from Nice to Calvi. Hardly any people onboard. Crew were not particularly friendly or welcoming but we were served a cookie and soft drinks. Landed smoothy although slightly delayed due to a missed approach. However tickets were cheap and luggage included. All in all a decent experience.
1653,A good trip. I did Paris-Orly-Calvi and Calvi-Marseille. These trips were fairly good staff at the airport and cabin crew where very good. Biscuits and a drink served onboard (totally normal for the time of the flight which is not longer than one hour and a half). However the seat was really small.
1654,Awful customer service. The flight attendants care more about talking to each other than taking care of customers. Don't expect much water service -- expect to be dehydrated. There is a war at the gate over luggage due to the cramped seating - expect a lot of airline staff to be yelling at you. Seating is cramped awful uncomfortable. Avoid this airline.
1655,Reserved and paid for regular Air Canada round trip Toronto to Puerto Vallarta last year for travel this April. Wound up on Rouge with a person with a dog in a carrier under the seat next to me. This left no space for the passenger's legs so he took part of my space which was tight enough already. When I politely asked for another seat I was told there were none. I walked the length of the plane and there were seats at the back. No entertainment tablets for $10 that did not work mushy sandwich and knees in my back. Thanks but no thanks - no more Air Canada for me. Rouge me once but not twice.
1656,My flight was changed to Rouge. I didn't have enough leg room seats were horrible and when I put my tray down it was so tight it touched my stomach. I have been a supporter of Air Canada but I have had enough. Flying another airline now. Will never touch an air Canada flight again. If you want to feel what a sardine feels like in a can fly Air Canada Rouge.
1657,"Paris Orly. Full fare ticket in Economy class on both sectors as no other airlines fly this route due to the ""public service"" law requirement. It is 100% affiliate with Air France and same basic service on their flights : a drink with some savoury biscuits. Nice-Ajaccio small regional aircraft very old and extremely noisy. Cabin crew average. Served one glass of water and nothing else. Ajaccio-Paris Orly a glass of apple juice with some savoury biscuits in a typical A320. Staff at the airport extremely helpful but crew quite average hardly noticing you. For this price the service is below standards and would consider the ferry boat !"
1658,"Rouge is a great disappointment. Air Canada has labelled it as a ""leisure"" airline which is code for poor service cramped seating space and price gouging. The number of ""Air Canada"" flight routes are rapidly dwindling with the carrier moving routes to Rouge service. Last week I flew Toronto return to Tampa. The seating pitch is cramped. The passenger next to me continually had their head in my lap while trying to access their under seat storage. When the passenger in front fully reclined their seat I briefly thought about offering them money to return their seat back so that I could have a few more inches of space. The entertainment system is not well thought out. Passengers on both my flights were not using headphones to watch their devices. Volume levels were on high to compete with the jet noise and their hearing aids. With the in-flight entertainment system headphones are required to access the entertainment sound. None of the flight attendants addressed the lack of headphone use issue but instead preferred to ignore it. The entertainment selection on the Rouge app is not appealing. Very sad is that the cost to fly Rouge in May was more than 40% higher than to fly Air Canada less than a year ago with the same advance booking time. I will not fly Rouge again."
1659,I recently used the last 2 credits of my Air Canada Sunpass (YUL-LAS) that I purchased in August 2013 fully Decided to take Air Canada Rouge to Orlando from Winnipeg. The only problem we needed to get to Toronto. No big deal since Air Canada flies out of that city. Well a typical Air Canada flight was then met with a fresh and fun flight on Rouge to Orlando. Inflight entertainment was easy to use and reliable. Young hardworking staff. Both pilots stood at the front and said goodbye to passengers something you don't always see. Was it cramped - not really as I'm 6'1 and was able to stretch my legs beneath the seat.
1660,I recently used the last 2 credits of my Air Canada Sunpass (YUL-LAS) that I purchased in August 2013 fully expecting the full J experience I had paid for. Took the first return flight in September and it was the mainline perfect. Then my route got Rouged. Had 4 credits left and I got to be the guinea pig on one of the very first Rouge flights to LAS. Late broken plane. Inexperienced crew. IPADs didn't work. Then they did. Saw the selection and was wishing it didn't work again. Service was poor to passable seats were broken. Lumpy metal boxes blocking the under seat space for feet or bags. I just used my final 2 credits a few days ago and expected some kinks to be worked out nope same crummy IFE.
1661,Worst flying experience in a very long time. Flew AC Rouge back from Vegas to Calgary. First irritant was paying Worst flying experience I have had. Las Vegas-Toronto. Unfriendly and no service nothing to eat no entertainment. Very hot on the plane.
1662,Flew Toronto to Las Vegas with Air Canada Rouge. Didn't realize when booking that this was the new discount airline. Had to pay $25 each each way to check a bag. When we got to the airport flight was delayed by an hour due to issues with the plane. Kept announcing more and more delays. Flight crew showed up then left. When our plane was finally ready to go no one could get a hold of the crew had to wait another 10 minutes for them to show up. Carry-on compartments were small attendants spent forever trying to rearrange them to fit everyone's bags. Maybe if checked bags were free people wouldn't be trying to cram so much into their carry-ons? Seats were cramped no TV screens at all. You can download an app for your iPad to watch movies which they tell you about on the plane (app has to be downloaded before boarding). Or you can rent one of Air Canada's iPads for $10. Food was awful not worth the $30 it cost. Usually like Air Canada but will never fly with Air Canada Rouge again.
1663,"Worst flying experience in a very long time. Flew AC Rouge back from Vegas to Calgary. First irritant was paying to have my bag checked. Apparently because I was flying on airmiles I couldn't check in online. Got to the check in area at airport and the desk clerks were insistent I use self check in which didn't work properly for us so eventually they let me (and my party of 5) check in at the counter. If I wanted to change seats they were going to charge me $25 per seat (by the way these are all things that another airline provides free of charge). No entertainment system other than their ""rent an ipad"" system I tried to connect my tablet as they indicated with free wi-fi but because I had not pre loaded some app it did not work. Glad I did not rent an iPad for $10 because they only passed them out nearly an hour into the flight and collected them an hour prior to landing (which left less than an hour for viewing). Leg room is a bit of a joke and the speaker system above my head nearly blew my eardrums out which was more than just a small irritant. Oh yes nearly forgot to mention that for no explained reason they changed the time of my flight to more than one hour earlier. I will do everything in my power to avoid flying this airline in the future. I think it might be time to trade in my Aeroplan miles for some other rewards."
1664,"Earlier this year I bought a flight pass (an 8 flt SunPass to be used from YYC-LAS) all the flight were AC. My first return booking with my flight pass my trip there is AC with all the regular amenities - and leg room. My trip back however was on Rouge and all further flights on the pass look to be Rouge as well. I am tall 6'2"" and I actually ""upgraded"" to Rouge Premier which is their version of Business Class. My knees still touched the seat in front of me and the seats were no wider. Still 3x3 in ""Business Class"" upfront so if you pay for an upgrade (I used points) be very careful as you can still get a middle seat. Still the same as the back no power no entertainment. but they do offer an iPad with the App pre-loaded which still makes me shake my head. No real place to put it with the exception that it came with a cover and you could sort of hang it from the seat back in front of you where in other airlines the entertainment was supposed to go. Two problems with this. 1) the earphone cable has to stretch over the tray and if you're using that for a drink or food the risk of knocking something off of that with the earphone cable rises sharply and of more concern 2) if the plane hits some unexpected turbulence all of a sudden you've got iPads flying everywhere - at least far more than you would on an AC flt. All this aside I still felt like I've paid for an 8 pass with an AC and got a 'bait and switch' to Rouge with no options. Some of us have to travel (it's not for vacation) and when we do and have paid for and expected a certain level of service (which I felt was fair and competitive with AC) and suddenly you are still paying the same price but the level of service comfort and even safety has dropped dramatically I can't feel but that I got bait and switched."
1665,Purchased Business Class Toronto to Las Vegas horrible surprise. Very uncomfortable. We had to hold iPads to watch the entertainment. Staff advised to hang on headrest in front of us. iPad fell and spilled drinks several times. Paid for business class for extra comfort very surprised of smaller seat than usual Air Canada business class.
1666,Flew from Jamaica on a Boeing 767 good headroom pleasant crew but horrible placing of the 'press for service button' on the armrest meant constant and irritable sounds of sometimes very loud multiple alarms going off. Even the crew were upset and they had to put up with it going and coming! If you can fly a different airplane I will definitely avoid the 767s.
1667,After booking my flight to Disneyland in August 2013 we had a fabulous vacation. Tired and hungry we (the group of 9 of us) boarded our flight in LA to Vancouver with a dead cell phone fully anticipating being able to charge it on the plane. To my surprise the flight had no way of charging my phone nor did we have video to occupy our 3 hour long flight with our knees in the back of the seats of other unlucky passengers in front of us. My 9 year old son also had his knees touching the seat in front of him and a seat in the face as the other uncomfortable passenger tilted their seat back in hopes of finding some extra space. The flight crew were insistent on asking us how we were enjoying the flight numerous times. It got annoying. Fortunately we had bought snacks to prepare us for the dinner we would miss during the flight and thankful we did because we weren't even offered so much as a bag of peanuts. As we were flying internationally we needed to fill out declaration cards. Someone didn't stock them on the flight so we had to fight our way through the small table outside of customs to fill out our declaration cards. This could have occupied some of the boring time we spent on the flight looking at the obvious hole in the seats where the video consoles had been removed. The good news was it gave us a great place to put our hands on so we could attempt to nap on our forearms. Oh and to hold onto when we landed. Fortunately we had wifi for our ipad! This was a saving grace - we tried to connect no luck. This was when they came over the system to proudly tell us we could use the wifi for free and hopefully we had previously downloaded their app to view inflight movies. Much to our surprise the wifi would only work within their app. But no worries we could pay 10.00 to use a complimentary ipad that had said downloaded app on it. I had never heard of Rouge before but I do now. I suggest you do not fly them. If I wanted to fly in a cattle car I would have booked through a cheaper carrier. Shame on you Air Canada! Shame on you!
1668,April 24 AC 7971. It is hard to imagine what management thinks about when they make decisions totally focused on the bottom line rather than customer service. So with service now inferior flight comfort at an all time low then why use AC? I was loyal but no longer. After a series of awful trips horrible service and basically no compensation then I will now be an airline shopper. I get they want to make money and I support that but Service and Comfort are what count. Rouge is just awful it is like a charter flight with higher prices. Plus with no entertainment unless you have an Apple device they don't tell you that so I wasted a few hours trying to download their entertainment onto my PC laptop. Worked out better as I spent the time reading. They launch this ridiculously confusing distinction program which I still have no idea what it is for! PS if you are going to Europe try Swiss or Lufthansa both offer great service and comfort.
1669,I have not boarded my Rouge flight yet that will be this Thursday. I am not looking forward to it after reading the above comments. I looked at prices from the Bahamas to Toronto in March and wondered why after mid April prices increased. I finally booked the flight I'm leaving on. I could have left April 17th for 240 Canadian but it was too cold in Ontario to go back. Now we are paying 271.05 each to return on a less than comfortable flight. I will see how it is but just losing the entertainment part is annoying. Does AC think we all have I-pads and i- phones? I will be flying Westjet from now on. Air Canada not one dime of taxpayer money do you get for wrecking your own business.
1670,Air Canada 1873 April 22nd. Lousiest airline I have ever been on. Extremely small spaces between rows. Flight attendants cannot even speak French properly they all seem like they just got out of high school very non- professional staff. Will never fly Air Canada again.
1671,"Brand new ""Rouge"" - I am a frequent flyer with Air Canada but was ""forced"" onto their new ""Rouge"" service on a recent pleasure trip to Cuba. Flew ""Rouge"" Montreal-Holguin on May 1 return on May 8. Connected each way to YVR on regular AC. Massively unhappy with Rouge. Pretty new exterior paint odd uniforms (what were you thinking?) but the bottom line is AC is forcing people to use Rouge and it is just a ""bait and switch"". Crew were pleasant and flights on time - but this trip was charter by another name! Seat pitch very poor seats thin and anything happening in seat pocket behind ands up communicated to your lower back. The ""entertainment"" system (bring your own tablet or rent one for $10.00 from them. I had pre-loaded their required software and it worked perfectly on way down but on way back - failed and failed (same for man next to me). Crew suggested I needed newer software (hey it was new and worked 7 days previously). Next time if they force (and they do) Rouge on me - I am switching to a different charter airline (for that is what Rouge is - it is a bait and switch) for lower service levels - lack of comfort (oh and no business class cabin not even premium economy). I am retired and felt beat-up on this trip. Not happy. Better of with a ""real charter"" - next time I will avoid anything ""Rouge""."
1672,"A new expression for airline travel! ""We have been ""rouged"". My husband is a very frequent flyer (Elite status) and always tries to use Air Canada. We flew AC May 1 YVR-MON-Holguin (return on 8th). The Vancouver-MON were fine (usual economy with Air Canada). Rouge is horrible Seats are jammed in like Sunwing or similar seats too thin and you spent hours being nudged and bumped by any movement behind you food not good (as usual) but worst is the ""entertainment"" system. You bring your own and we did - our iPad all pre-loaded as they asked worked one way but not on return. Crew were polite but suggested our operating system needed updating (in a week). Never again. There is no price advantage there was no premium economy sets are very cheap and above all Air Canada is trapping it's loyal customers into this trick."
1673,"Booked two economy tickets on Air Canada in April 2013 to fly to Grenada from YYZ and paid over $1000 per ticket for a flight in March 2014. Paid extra for bulkhead seats. Air Canada switched flights to Rouge without even notifying us and gave away the seat selection we had paid extra for. Not only that but they changed from flying on Saturdays to Mondays. The seat pitch on Rouge flights is 29"". This is one of the lowest in the airline industry. To add insult to injury they awarded us a fraction of the Aeroplan points because the flight was operated by Rouge and not Air Canada. Wish there was a star rating for 0."
1674,"Never again. After so many years of loyalty but now feel completely ""rouged"". There is no deal there are no option on routes - its Rouge or nothing. Business class is a joke! 9 hours waiting for a plane to arrive because they could not substitute with regular AC fleet. So why not inconvenience passengers who paid the same price as AC fares and then refuse to post comments on their website. Goodbye Rouge Hello Westjet!"
1675,"What a ripoff! Had business class seats but ended up flying Rouge from Orlando to Toronto in their so-called ""premium"" seats. What a joke not even close to business and only marginally better than the horror story that was economy class. Crowded rushed and rude attendants. I learned a lesson here - to stay away from Rouge."
1676,"My sister and I decided to go to Barbados for Easter. Booked business class. We were very shocked when we got on the plane and saw what Rouge defines as business class. Paid the same price as a regular Air Canada business ticket but definitely did not feel that we were flying business. Staff were young and trying their best but could not pacify the unhappy passengers in ""business class"". I decided to make the best of it but its difficult to enjoy your flight when everyone around you is so angry. The iPad we were given was a joke! Movies were not even close to be current releases. Every time I paused the movie I was forced back to the beginning. Very frustrating. I think the worst part was the passengers from economy coming up to ""business class"" to use the lavatory. I had an aisle seat with people from the back of the plane forming a line beside me. If I wanted people to hover around me I would have booked economy. When I asked the attendant if they should be up here she said no but did nothing about it. The attendants had no control over the situation. We were in the last row of ""business"" on the way home and had the first row economy person constantly pushing on my seat. Again this is something you expect in economy class. It was a long flight which I usually don't mind when I am sitting in business. But this is not business! I am very hesitant to book Air Canada ever again as I am afraid that it will be another Rouge flight."
1677,May 5 return from Phoenix. What's the value proposition for the customer. I still can't get an answer. We just spent 10 hours in the Phoenix spirit because of a Rouge malfunction with the plane coming from Toronto. Because it's Rouge and not Air Canada they had to wait for a Rouge plane coming from San Diego. We got this great service. Poor legroom and no inflight entertainment and at the same normal Air Canada fare. I'm a long time super elite. Westjet will be flying Toronto - Phoenix. Why wouldn't I fly that way in the future. I am so so disappointed.
1678,26 Aug AC1924. 2 Sep AC1925. Flew to Costa Rica could not wait to get off that plane. Staff were too young inexperienced and rude. Forget service it was as if you were bothering them if you asked for anything. No in- flight entertainment unless you provided your own unfortunately if your computer iPad etc ran out of power there are no outlets for charging your equipment. Was planning a trip to Ireland with AC and once we found out it was with Rouge the 5 of us are now going to fly Westjet. On future trips will still fly AC but will not fly Rouge again nor will I book clients on Rouge flights. Sorry Rouge gave you a fair shot and you failed so badly I can not give you another chance unless you drastically lower your prices to match what you offer.
1679,"Flew from Phoenix to Toronto this week on Rouge. Boarding was delayed as the staff spent at least a half hour trying to get passengers to check their carry ons due to the fact that the Rouge planes have a much smaller overhead bin. That's not the only thing that is smaller and uncomfortable. The seats are tight (this says a lot coming from someone who is 5' 3"") the entertainment choices are dated/if they work staff are young and inexperienced service was disorganized and slow. We will do anything we can not to take a Rouge flight ever again. I understand that they might want to offer a lower priced alternative to travellers but there are no deals on their flights compared to their previous Air Canada flights. We're stuck with this as the only option until Westjet begins their service YYZ to PHX - with luck this fall. Can't imagine who thought this would be a good idea - whoever it was should be made to sit in a middle seat for a 5 hour flight and rethink all that Rouge has to offer."
1680,"On May 1st my wife son and I were on the inaugural Rouge flight from Toronto to Dublin with regular flights from Edmonton to Toronto. We booked last summer and knew the flight would be on Rouge and the price seemed to be OK. Interestingly our daughter and her boyfriend later booked on regular Air Canada through London and paid over $100 each less than us. There goes the low cost airline unless low cost means low cost for the airline which translates into rip off for the customer. The plane we travelled on was a Boeing 767. The plane we originally boarded had a broken windshield wiper and therefore had to be abandoned in favor of a second plane. This delayed our departure by over two hours. We were seated in economy class. Looking at the six abreast ""premium class"" seats my wife and I were glad we hadn't paid for an upgrade. The economy class seats are very slim and rows are close together. This might be ok for short flights of up to three hours but nothing to look forward to for a transatlantic flight. Further the seats hardly recline at all. Lacking blankets and pillows good luck for some sleep and welcome to aches and pains arriving in Dublin. Entertainment is via WiFi through iPads or lap top computers with flash player. No option for Android devices. Anyway I could not get it to work on my computer. $5 saved. The cabin crew was young and inexperienced in silly uniforms. Food quality was airline minus minus. A free soft drink was provided but alcoholic beverages had to be paid for (free on my daughter's cheaper regular Air Canada flight). All together Air Canada Rouge is a rip off approaching Ryan Air quality. At least Ryanair is open about its cattle truck approach. After having failed with two attempts at budget airlines what is Air Canada thinking? I expect Rouge to die and unceremonious death - the sooner the better."
1681,"AC1760 Toronto to Holguin Cuba March 16 2014. Return flight AC1761 March 23. Booked an Air Canada Vacations package to Cuba. I would generally use ACV because service tended to be a bit better than other vacation companies. I guess those days are gone. The flight was terribly uncomfortable. Seat padding is thin inadequate leg room (I'm 6'3"") no entertainment unless you own or rent an ipad and all this for the price of a regular flight. I'll be looking for other options from now on."
1682,Only problem I had with the plane was the seats. The entertainment was poor but it didn't bother me. Flight staff were good. I would pay more to fly on a non rouge flight but they don't offer any to Florida. For our next flight I have paid the extra $40 for premium seats still in economy though so I hope the extra $ is worth it.
1683,Round trip Toronto to San Jose Costa Rica in Feb. 2014. We paid an additional substantial fee for the upgrade which provided slightly more leg room and the middle seat blocked off with pillows providing more room to aisle and window seat passengers. Pillows! We sent Air Canada a complaint email regarding many problems we experienced in booking our tickets finding out at the last minute that we were bumped down to economy etc. and have not yet heard back from them. Next time we travel to Costa Rica it's with WestJet.
1684,"Flights both to Venice and from Venice were fine, on time and relatively uncomplicated. However, it angered us that our carry-on bags, that were by Lufthansa standards (dimensions and weight), had to be checked on the return flight to Munich, yet fit perfectly on our flight from Munich to Venice two weeks earlier. If you have carry-on guidelines and people follow them, they should never be told that they must have to check them! A ""carry-on"" bag should be just that, one that you can bring on the plane."
1685,I traveled AC Rouge on flight 1851 March 17 and returned on flight 1852 March 20. We found that we were on a newer version of the 767-300 with the wing tips turned up. The first class cabin had been reduced in size so that it was hard to get our carry on past the passengers already sitting without bumping them. When we got to our seats in a row near the back of the plane it was impossible to get our two regulation AC carry on bags in the same overhead. Seating was very cramped and my knees were tight against the seat in front of me. I had a window seat and it was very cold sitting there. My husband is 72 years old and has some circulation issues and could not move at all even though there was no baggage under the seat in front of him. We will not be able to travel AC Rouge anymore and will look for another carrier! We found the cabin crew was young and seemed stressed and not well trained. This gave me a very uneasy feeling if there happened to be an emergency.
1686,AC Rouge 1836 May 6 2014 Phoenix to Ottawa. This used to be an enjoyable flight until it was converted to Rouge. When we booked we did not know that this would be a Rouge flight for which we were charged for seat selection even though we selected within the 24 hour window of the flight. I am 6 feet and the seating/leg room was really cramped and not pleasant. Thankfully the person in front of me did not recline their seat. One of the washrooms was out of order which created long lines and difficult passage through the aisle and no doubt inconvenience and annoyance for those seated in last several rows. The crew made only one pass with the beverage cart. While I bring my own iPad for entertainment others were left wondering where the inflight TVs went. The crew were very young-and likely inexperienced-their dress was unprofessional and I have doubts that they would have performed to the same level in an emergency as a more experienced crew. Good luck getting everyone out of the plane in an emergency especially through the over the wing exits with less space to manoeuvre in. While we arrived safely I am left wondering why Air Canada worked so hard to make air travel less enjoyable. I will not be flying Rouge again regardless of price. I will seek out alternatives even if it means driving to Syracuse to fly an American airline.
1687,"I flew Rouge from Toronto to Tampa for the first time a couple of weeks ago and upgraded to business using my e- upgrade credits - what a joke! seats are crammed no entertainment and staff are very new to the industry. As a super elite member with Air Canada I was more than upset that I had used six e-upgrade credits for such a terrible ""business class"" - these planes are awful and its clear it's all about quantity and no regard for the comfort of the traveler."
1688,"One of the best airlines I have flown with. We flew from Riga to Frankfurt with Lufthansa, and then from Frankfurt to Verona with Air Dolomiti. The flight wasn't long, about 1hr 10 minutes. The flight attendants were friendly. I would recommend."
1689,"The flight was late but the service on board was prompt and affable. The food is particularly nice for a European regional carrier. The biggest problem was that, as in other cases before, the miles were not registered. Every time it takes a series of e-mails to get them registered to Miles and More or other rewards programs."
1690,"I was flying from TRN-MUC last August, the overall flight experience was good. I booked the flight through Lufthansa where Air Dolomiti is their carrier operating from Turin. The cabin crew were polite and helpful. The flight was on time, but the ground crew delayed it a few minutes with moving passengers from the aircraft to the terminal. I flew thrice in the same month on the same route where my overall satisfaction was good."
1691,"Regularly commute between LA and YVR. Was shocked by the sudden change to Rouge - and that's the only AC option now. The tightest legroom of any plane I have been on - have to be under 5'5"". All language is around ""leisure"" so it appears they have abandoned interest in serving the frequent or business traveler. Web site does not even have new routes on them. Premium service is a joke with economy seats that just leave the middle seat empty - but still charge you business class prices ($700+ one way). Paid the same price as I always have for less service and less room."
1692,Have flown Air Canada Rouge three times - once to Vegas once to Cancun and once to Orlando. Both my Vegas and Cancun trips were booked on Air Canada and then moved to Rouge. In each case the flights were equally as expensive as Air Canada has historically been on those routes (I travel a ton for both work and pleasure. These are things I watch all the time). But the aircraft is terrible the lack of entertainment is a problem with kids (my little ones can't hold iPads on their laps!!) and the flight times were changed in the case of the Cancun flight from 10am to 6:30am. On one flight I upgraded to business class using 10 upgrade credits only to find that business class is the same seat as coach without someone in the middle seat!
1693,Worst flight ever! Flew with 3 small children (2 6 & 8). Horrible service. Non-existant entertainment (most of the movies were circa 1993 or older). Air Canada saw fit to rearrange our pre-paid assigned seats. None of us were sitting together. My 2 year old was supposed to sit alone 2 rows behind me. And our girls were also alone. Asked for help at 1800 # and checkin desk and was told there was nothing they could do. Same story at the gate and was told I would have to ask passengers for help. Added in a random stopover that wasn't on the original booking. Made us get off the plane on that stopover and get back on the same plane (& same crew) 20 min later in new seats that we once again had to rearrange! Seats are horrendously uncomfortable. What a total disaster. I have flown many times with my kids - never had a problem before. We only flew AC this time as we were able to book our tickets on points.
1694,LH1964 18 Aug operated by Air Dolomiti. Great service. We were offered very tasteful tramezzino. FA offered 2 or 3 drinks and tramezzino rounds.
1695,Flight LH9444 from Munich to Bergamo Orio al Serio. Seating 8C (economy class). The short trip was really good and inexpensive. On board the seating was comfortable and the legroom was perfect. Also service on board was good but one hostess was impolite (the only negative note).
1696,PSA-MUC in June 2014 in economy class. Flight left with +/- 25mins delay due to a medical emergency on board. Spacious cabin in this nice Embraer 195 aircraft. Refreshing towel for hands and face was offered before take-off and after take-off the meal service begun including a sandwich and drinks. Wine is offered in a real glass which is a bonus! Second time for me on this airline and truly to be recommended!
1697,Last January my wife and I had a flight to Cancun booked with Air Canada at least 6 months in advance. I contacted transportation in Mexico and was advised that the flight number that I had given them for pick up did not exist. I called Air Canada and after about 35 minutes my call was answered. I was just told that I had a new flight number ( no mention of change of services). You can imagine our surprise as we entered our seat and found out we were on a new product called rouge - it felt like we were on a real charter. After 3 hours in the air it was also obvious that this new product is a training center for new employees. We are now trying to book a flight to Cancun for next xmas and new year. Much to our surprise Rouge is our only option - the prices are substantially higher than all our years travelling to Cancun. Trying to get answers on anything such as schedule changes sales or just about anything is next to impossible.
1698,BGI-YYZ AC1831. I'd be ok if I was paying discount prices for what I got but sadly Air Canada has found another way to take advantage of the lack of competition on these routes from Canada. As options are limited and BGI is home I guess I'm stuck. I'm just waiting for them to find a way to only award half the Aeroplan miles.
1699,I have traveled six segments with AC this spring and been pushed into the Rouge. Each time it has been a disaster and the service has decreased each time. The crews are very young and seems there is not any leadership at all. The last flight I experienced the newer model 767-300 which is built different than the older 767-300 and the overhead storage will not accept two legal size carry on bags and this created extreme stress with passengers and crew! On one flight my wife asked for a glass of water to take medication and was told to wait until the refreshment cart came around which was 1/2 an hour later. Another flight I asked for two more beers when we were 1 hour out of Toronto and the young staff just laughed and never returned. I have flown AC since 1958 and watched them go into bankruptcy protection on several occasions and they are track for the next time. Once a company forgets who the customer is and who is paying for the service they are on their way down.
1700,MUC-FLR in February 2014 in economy flight was full. Plane was clean-although economy was pretty cramped flight staff was pleasant and professional. Air Dolomiti even gave us a snack and a drink on this short flight. Arrived on time. Would recommend (they are part of the Lufthansa network we thought we were booking a LH flight when we booked). Enjoyable experience.
1701,Flew on a charter from Gatwick to Verona on an Inghams holiday. The flights both ways were on time and 30 minutes shorter than quoted. The staff were welcoming professional and immaculate. The plane was an Embraer 195 and was spotless. Snacks only provided so no comments really well it was a charter. I would not hesitate to fly again with them.
1702,I had a pleasantly smooth flight. Service was excellent plane spotless plenty of sparkling wine to keep me company during my flight from Turin to Munich - I wish they flew out of London as well as I would go out of my way to use this company.
1703,I booked an Air Canada seat to Los Angeles from Vancouver and was switched to Rouge without confirmation and no reduction in price (which was more expensive than flying to Toronto). The seats are painfully cramped and I only got a Diet Coke on descent as the crew was disorganized; there was no time to even pay for food because they didn't have time.
1704,Was suppose to fly and paid for Business Class seat on Air Canada Toronto to Orlando in March. I fly Business Class to have a very large seat and a lot more leg room. It gives me a lot more room to work. This particular trip I flew AC using Aeroplan Airmiles. Get on the plane boarded to find out I am on an Air Canada Rouge Flight- in a class called Premium Class same size seat as an Economy Class seat. They block the middle seat with pillows belted in. The flight attendant assured me that even though the seat was a normal size seat that their service would be the same as Business Class. When I returned to Toronto I posted on Air Canada Rouge's Face Book page my disappointment. The replies for AC Rouge FB staff made all kinds of excuses. The end result after 10 messages back and forth they tell you send a letter to AC's Customer Relations. Customer after customer make the same negative comments. AC Rouge remove negative comment for the FB page and then block you from posting any more. Air Canada 'Rouge tells the customers to message Air Canada. Air Canada tell customers to contact Aeroplan. Aeroplan tells to it not their problem. Its on made vicious circle tying to get your problem solved. All I was asking for was the difference in Airmiles between AC Business Class Seat and a Regular Ecomony Class seat refunded to my Aeroplan Account.
1705,"I understand the business model for Air Canada's decision to launch a ""low cost"" leisure (vacation) airline to popular vacation destinations in USA South and Europe. Their 'regular' Air Canada flights are staffed by more experienced (and expensive) crews with higher salaries and benefits such as employee pension plans and expensive to operate and maintain in-flight entertainment systems. Air Canada was having trouble competing on many of these routes served by other vacation airlines such as Air Transat Sun Wing and some charters. In my opinion the airline had another reason - their fleet of Airbus A319 and Boeing 767 aircraft were growing old and tired and needed new duties while Air Canada began a program of planning for their eventual replacement at the main airline with the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner and other aircraft types. Hence Rouge was born. I have been a loal Air Canada customer for over 30 years -- even travelled with them to Mexico which was excellent - but this Rouge experiment leaves a bad taste in my mouth and aches in my legs and back. The refurbished Rouge cabins on these planes have more rows of seats which means less leg room. Cramped and uncomfortable on a long flight to your vacation is not my ideal way of arriving. While the flight crew at Rouge are very attentative and friendly I feel pity for them that they have to deal with passenger complaints that are mostly no fault of their own. I recently flew Air Transat to Jamaica in a nice comfortable wide-body A330 with lots of leg room and a big seat-back free entertainment system all with refurbished cabins with soothing colours and advanced lighting to limit effects of jet lag. Lots of overhead storage space too. Fourth time I flew with them and never been disappointed. Rouge needs to change soon or they will just go to the place in the sky where many other airlines have gone before them to die. Rouge was supposed to be a ""new airline"" according to Air Canada."
1706,Venice to Munich en route to Toronto 26 October 2012. Arrived at Marco Polo at 5.30 am for 8.45 am flight. Smooth check-in with two young staff members assisting passengers. Our slightly overweight suitcases accepted without comment and no surcharge. Informed our flight was delayed 2 hours (which would have caused us to miss our Air Canada connection in Munich) but we were being put on the 7 am flight which was boarding shortly. Sent past the long line for security check as Priority passengers and loaded on the transporter minutes later. The ATR7 my first non-jet flight took off on time with a full load. Almost immediately we were served a tasty cake with cappuccino by a smiling attendant. Began descent into Munich 20 minutes ahead of the scheduled flight time. A comfortable plane excellent service friendly staff efficient processing.
1707,Flew from Pisa to Munich on an ATR 72. Never flew on that model before and was amazed. Nice aircraft. Service was ok and the flight arrived on time. Seating was ok. Little narrow but then again its only a regional airline. The whole operation had an Italian charm. All in all a nice small charismatic airline.
1708,Rome - Munich: The flight started 15 minutes late and we had a tight connection to Hamburg. Onboard we were greeted with friendly cabin crew handing out newspapers but unfortunately no English ones. The leg room was acceptable for 2 hour flight and seats were soft enough. We were given cheese sandwiches and drinks. In the end we did make it to our connection without being in hurry. All in all a good product from Lufthansa and will definitely recommend them.
1709,Flew Business FRA-BGY-FRA on the same day. Total cost of 180??return. Service was excellent food was fresh and tasty (cheese ham and fruits on the outbound salmon on the inbound flight). Cabin crew was always smiling. Definitely recommended.
1710,"Along with 14 other passengers (18 in total) we booked our trip and paid for a flight on Air Canada. We were subsequently switched without our knowledge consent or a reduction in airfare in to the ""Rouge"" airline. We were ""Rouged"". Discount airline while paying regular price. Very deceitful. After learning of the switch I inquired to see if there would be any noticeable changes between the two carriers and was told ""no just the flight number and departure times"". That was incorrect. Rouge has pathetic inflight entertainment that you pay for and the food is inadequate for a family travelling with young children. The one item that may appeal to children (pizza) was not available."
1711,Booked return flight from Toronto to San Diego recently for a conference and was looking forward to comfortable business class seating. Their version of business class is that they only fill the aisle and window seats leaving the centre seat open - really? How does that make up for horrendously uncomfortable narrow seats and no legroom? Entertainment was a joke - movies on I-pads were very old (Gigi) and certainly not very thought provoking. I gave up and read for the duration of the trip. FA's uniforms are terrible. Come on Air Canada what are you trying to do here. The passenger beside me paid $2600 for his flight from Montreal and this is considered low fare?
1712,AC switched my flights Toronto-Tampa return to Rouge without disclosure. Cramped seats no entertainment included. I will avoid Rouge whenever I can in future worst I have flown in years.
1713,BLQ-FRA in a nice and clean Embraer 195. Loved the interior colours. Good service onboard and very friendly. Tasty snack on this 100 minutes flight.
1714,Pisa-Munich on ATR72. Great experience. Cabin spotless and flight attendants were professional and friendly. Inflight service started with refreshing towel for hands and face. Then offered Italian wine (choices from menu and wine served in a glass) plus a sandwich. Wish they flew in the US.
1715,Frequently flown Frankfurt to Milan (Linate/Malpensa) or Munich to Milan (Malpensa). Airline is good and generally on schedule. But to my utter disappointment the snack on the return leg frequently is only non-vegetarian. Planes are usually small so one can expect a bumpy flight.
1716,MUC-PSA return on ATR72. Plane was small but comfortable. FA's were friendly. Was given a sandwich which surprisingly was actually edible. I've heard good things about this airline and now I know why.
1717,I recently flew from Tampa to Toronto on Rouge. I was booked and paid for a regular AC flight but was changed to Rouge without any notice. We were packed on the plane like sardines no entertainment poor service. Our friends were with us. He is quite tall and he had to spread his legs around the seat in front of him because there was no leg room. Add to this the fact you pay for seat selection baggage lousy food cheap wine. And don't dear be one pound over your 50 pound limit per suitcase - or you will be on the floor at the counter area exposing your underwear to several others rearranding your baggage.
1718,"It was not less expensive than regular Air Canada. We flew regular Air Canada Toronto to Palm Beach International and flew home from Orlando to Toronto on Rouge. The Rouge leg was more expensive but we had no choice to fly it as they only do Rouge to/from Orlando now it seems. Worst part we brought Ipads for our children and ourselves but only 2/4 of us could log on to the in-flight ""entertainment"" because we were told by flight attendant there is a limit to how many people can log on during the flight. And the ""entertainment"" is all very old shows. Will never fly them again and will only fly Air Canada if I have no other choices."
1719,"Tampa to Toronto. Just got ""rouged"" last night. One of the worst flying experiences. No leg room. (I am 5'6"" which shouldn't be too squished.) The seats were so uncomfortable. I had the person behind me's knees in my lower back the whole time. No tv. Can rent an ipad for $10."
1720,Flew Air Dolomiti from Munich to Milan. It was a pleasant flight. After being delayed in Toronto for over 3 hrs we originally missed our connection but Lufthansa within 15 mins of landing in Munich got us on the next flight out. It was a very nice flight - the seats were comfortable the cabin-crew staff very friendly and very surprisingly the food (sandwich) was delicious.
1721,TRS-MUC-TRS on AT7. Crew professional no more Settimocielo food box just an apple biscuit and hot/cold drinks. Return 1h 30mins delayed due to technical problems. Crew professional but fed up and tired due to evening delay. Salty nibbles and cold drinks offered. Generally not like it used to be.
1722,Munich - Rome as a part of our trip from London on a codeshare with Lufthansa The flight left on time and landed early. The cabin crew were really good and and friendly served a nice snack with drinks. Presentation of the plane and crew were spotless . Can recommend this airline.
1723,BLQ-MUC with ERJ195 very comfortable with huge leg room but cabin extremely dirty. Crew professional and friendly. Food consisted of just a small packed snack + beverages.
1724,Rouge is a thinly disguised process of jamming more people into the same space. I am a Super Elite 100k Aeroplan member. I had my first Rouge flight Phoenix to Toronto and the seats are uncomfortable leg room is awful there was one beverage service. I initially booked on AC with my usual aisle. I was moved to window with no notification.
1725,Booked Air Canada regular flight and got switched to Rouge. Seats cramped service very poor no in flight entertainment no snacks (you even have to pay for pretzels). Will not fly Rouge again. Can't trust Air Canada not to Rouge me again so will fly another carrier.
1726,I booked a flight from Toronto to Puerto Vallarta last June 2013 on an Air Canada flight for March/April 2014. I pre booked aisle and middle seats. I was switched to Rouge with no choice. I am 5'10' my legs were pressed against the seat back. Our seats were changed to window and middle. There was no entertainment. You could watch movies if you had the Air Canada app but we did not know that in advance. They also changed the return flight to March 31 so we missed one day's vacation no big deal if the service had been there. They also charged me $150 for a bike one way. I sent two emails to air canada but no reply.
1727,"Well organized boarding by seat rows and friendly ground staff. Cabin crew was professional and friendly but never saw them smiling during the entire flight. Because of the short flight time there was no on board food and drink service, which was fine. PA announcements were very fast and monotonous so you needed full attention to understand. The plane did not have any kind of IFE. In general I was satisfied with the service offered."
1728,FRA-VRN-MUC Embraer ERJ195 and ATR72. Clean and pleasant cabin with professional crew. Good snacks and beverages offered. Check-in screens were not working in Verona so we had to wait for a quite long time.
1729,"VRN to FRA return with ATR 72 and Embraer 195. The cabin crew was professional and kind legroom was excellent. Newspaper available onboard free. The catering was excellent considering the flight time (1:00 h): into the ""Settimocielo"" box there were a salty snack a sweet and a small cup of water. Hot and cold beverages (including wines) offered by the cabin crew."
1730,Flight from Genoa to Munich was very pleasant. Excellent snacks and an overall atmosphere of relaxation throughout the flight. Lots of legroom. Nice plane a little on the noisy side.
1731,Munich to Venice return with a very nice Embraer 195. Both flights on time snack was tasty and crew was professional. To be quite honest I was not expecting Air Dolomiti to be such a good regional airline.
1732,"Pricing does not reflect the service level that reflects a no-frills airline. Seats are uncomfortable cabin crew are inattentive and the inflight entertainment is problematic to say the least. I have a Windows tablet and you cannot download the app to stream movies. Add to that the fact that Air Canada no longer gives me a choice to destinations that I travel to on business because they view them as ""vacation"" destinations. This means that I need to find a new airline."
1733,YUL-MCO on the Rouge A319. Seats cramped beyond anything I've experienced before. I'd sooner fly a US carrier with stopovers than fly a Rouge configuration again due to the limited seat pitch (I'm 6ft tall). On the other hand I didn't mind the BYOD in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system but the seats need power / usb ports for this to be really useful. I found the entire flight crew to be genuinely friendly and welcoming.
1734,I was recently bumped from Air Canada flights flying Toronto to San Diego and return and put on Rouge. It was like being on a plane manned by high school kids whose attitude flippant manner and vocabulary did not instill any level of security or professionalism to which I have been accustomed from Air Canada.
1735,"FCO to MAD. The flight was unmemorable from the service point of view, but was probably the most horrible boarding/security that I have ever experienced after 20+ flights. Boarding was a mess, there is no priority boarding for business class passengers, foods are served in plastic and there's only one beverage service. Food was eatable but not top-notch. Seemed like a snack service instead of a meal as it's too light. Seat was standard Eurobiz, but enhanced like a domestic US 1st class. But the ticket is EUR 250, only 15??more than economy, and in this case it was cheaper than full-fare economy. Wouldn't hesitate to choose them again for MAD-BCN on A330.  Choose a window out from FCO, as it's so beautiful."
1736,"I broke my foot on my vacation and the entire flight staff were amazing. The cabin staff were very accommodating and helpful. They gave me the extra room I needed to elevate my foot, helped me walk to the bathroom every time I needed to use it and frequently checked on me to make sure I was okay - the pilot even checked on me to see how I was doing. I appreciate the kindness of the staff and would fly with Air Europa again."
1737,"San Juan to Madrid was on time. No space for my legs in the plane. I had to put my legs next to the legs of my girlfriend because I was not able to stay seated in a normal position.  The food was not good but okay. No cabin entertainment (IFE) but I donÂ´t mind it as the flight was only 7 hours. This was the main advantage of this flight but I think next time I will prefer a more decent company like KLM or Air France even if I have to make stops. The most terrible experience was our check-in from MAD to MUC. We stayed one night in MAD and had a flight from to MUC at 7:20 am. We already had our boarding passes and we only had to check the baggage in. We were at the airport at 6am. There was a big line as all the passengers for all Air Europa flights have to stay in the same line which later splits to many check-in counters. I asked the employee in front of the line if there is a special urgent counter for our departure and she laconically sent me to the big queue. So we waited and arrived to the counter at 6:30. The employee at the counter told us that check-in of this flight is alread closed! She got a bit stressed and tried to call some colleague without success. Finally, she told us: ""Take your baggage and run to catch your flight!""   It meant we had to throw away our liquids, two bottels of rum from Puerto Rico and my pocket knife because there was already no way how to get it to the plane! Air Europa should improve their check-in procedure and not leave all the passengers waiting in one line - they have so many counters at the airport which can do check-in for different flights with different departure times. I will never use Air Europa for this lack of respect to the customer."
1738,TRS-MUC-TRS on AT7. Crew pleasant kind helpful kept passengers informed. Pilot talked to passengers all the time. Meal small but inventive surprising. Stewardesses smile. It seems that EN keeps its good standard!
1739,MUC-FLR ATR72-500. I have heard rumours of how noisy this aircraft is but to my great surprise it was just a little louder than a jet and I was even seated just beside the engine. Quite acceptable noise level ins the cabin. Flight stewardesses did a terrific work while we were flying over the Alps.
1740,MUC-Pisa and FLR-MUC : what a disappointment! Half a glass of liquid to drink miniature packet of snacks awful and the only food served in either direction. The aircon wasn't plugged in whilst on the ground and even in the air was hardly noticeable. One of the worst flights I've had. Boarding and disembarkation a shambles. 15 minute wait in aircraft with no air for bus to terminal.
1741,MUC BLQ return in business. Exceeded expectations. My heart sank at MUC when I realised it was a turboprop flight and I was expecting a LCC experience. Instead I had a nice breakfast of cold meats and bread rolls on the way out. On the return leg they served a nice dessert but I am not a dessert person. Flights were slightly delayed both times but not significantly so. Check in at BLQ was very efficient and the Marconi lounge has its own security lane which makes the whole process more pleasant.
1742,"I bought direct return flights a year ahead of time (YUL-CUN). I paid full fare. Without warning Air Canada re- routed me through YYZ and downgraded me to Air Canada Rouge. On the return flight I was also downgraded to Air Canada Rouge without any compensation whatsoever. On top of it the state-of-the-art wireless entertainment system didn't work and on the return flight we found out that the ""state-of-the-art"" wireless entertainment system doesn't even support the latest Windows 8.1 operating system. You should also know that the seats are extremely uncomfortable narrow and with little leg-room. The service was basic including incomprehensible French announcement (flight out of Toronto). On the return flight (direct to YUL) the flight attendants in economy didn't speak French but one. This simple fact increases risk in case of an emergency. Clearly Air Canada is reducing service and security (low cost) while maintaining full fare. It is a lost-lost for all travellers. Avoid Air Canada Rouge!"
1743,I also thought I was booking an Air Canada flight on-line and ended up on Air Canada Rouge. I did Toronto-San Jose-Toronto. Within 3 minutes of hitting the seat I told my partner we will never fly Air Canada Rouge again and unless there is a way to know whether our flight is an Air Canada flight or an Air Canada Rouge flight at the time of booking we are not booking with Air Canada again for fear of ending up on Air Canada Rouge. The aircraft is clean the crew were good the food was good but the seats are terribly uncomfortable and absolutely crammed in. We are iPad folks but the available entertainment is limited and dated. Never again.
1744,All flights to/from YYZ. All flights direct. Avoid Rouge whenever possible. Have flown on 6 Rouge flights. Similar experience to other travellers: very cramped seating normal pricing poor/inexperienced service misleading advertising regarding Premium Rouge service. Save yourself the frustration and book elsewhere.
1745,"The main flight is from MAD-LIM-MAD. First thing I noted was that in business class there are no personal monitors, you get an I-PAD with about 10 movies - was so uncomfortable to hold it. When seated I noticed that it is a recliner seat, which many airlines have and its ok. However, always the seat has for the legs a ""bar"" to put your feet so you dont slip down when you sleep, however they dont have it. The worst seat in business class I have had. The seats have electrical power points, however, its very hard to put your plug in and secondly it is that they don't work properly. Could not use charge my phone or or laptop to watch my movies. On the flight LIM-MAD I asked the cabin crew that I would like my lunch service to be served later (flight was at 10am so I had already had breakfast and didn't want to have lunch). The cabin crew were shocked and tried to convince me that I should eat now and not later. In total service is not their strong point. For me, the only reason I would fly them again is due to the fare gap that they have with airlines such as Iberia and KLM who fly as well to LIM."
1746,"MAD-ORY-MAD, Check in fast and easy, no lines both airports. Boarding by groups, all flights on time. 737, comfortable seats, nice FA, only food for sale. No bags checked, so no info on this. Convenient flights to Paris Orly, closer to city center. Will fly them again for sure."
1747,"I flew with AE from Frankfurt to Palma in Mallorca via Madrid vv. And when it is possible, I do not want to fly this airline anymore: I believe AE is not a low cost Airline but they treat the passengers as if they are flying for a cheap price. They did not offer even water for free. The seat cushion is like on Ryanair. From Madrid to Palma there was a delay for 1 hour so that I had to take a taxi to the hotel which is expensive."
1748,MUC-VCE rtn business class. An excellent overall experience. Very good ground facilities in Munich. Impeccable onboard service performed by onle one very efficient and friendly stewardess. Very tasty and imaginative food concept.
1749,BLQ-MUC return economy class. Nice ground service in MUC newspaper and sweets. Boarding fast and punctual. Flight on time excellent service with quality snacks soft drinks and wine. Excellent legroom clean airplane nice staff. Best regional airline tried recommended!
1750,Recently I experienced my first flight with Air Dolomiti and first time on an Embraer from Frankfurt to Verona. The boarding was punctual. Embraer is a nice plane and I enjoyed the fact that the seats are 2 by 2 only. The service onboard very professional. It was a flawless flight.
1751,Economy class from Munich to Florence on ATR 72. Aircraft clean though quite loud when seated next to the engine. After reading reviews on this site I did expect a better service. The flight attendants were smiling and friendly however they did not serve me and my girlfriend with beverages I had to request this specifically and the cookies that were the only food served on this late afternoon flight and disapointing.
1752,Traveled in business class from VCE-MUC and I'm not sure there was any difference in the seats or service in the front but the food was simple and fantastic. Loved that I could have a cappuccino onboard. The crew was friendly and helpful and the all around experience very positive.
1753,On March 2/14 a friend and I were booked on an Air Canada Flight. I had no idea that it was Rouge until I completed the on-line check in. Our flight was to take off at 6.30 am from Toronto Canada. We all boarded the plane and approximately 5 min before take off we were asked to leave the plane as there was no pilot scheduled for our flight. We had to wait for 2 hrs for them to find another pilot and for him to arrive.
1754,Las Vegas to Toronto flights on time - aircraft 767-300ER well maintained crew okay check-in staff efficient and checked my bags to final destination with other Star Alliance partner. Only one beverage service on this 4hrs+ flight. Cabin temperature very cold. Would fly them again if fare and schedule convenient for me.
1755,"April 21 2014. Flight AC1890. I recently booked a flight to Tampa Florida. When booking the flight nothing told me I was booking on Air Canada Rouge. If I had know I would not have booked this flight. I have never been on a plane where I have felt so crowded. I am only 5'4"" tall and my knees hit the seat in front of me. The seats are so close I could not bend over far enough to put anything under the seat. This is certainly discount flying at it's worst I will make sure the next time I fly I don't get on Air Canada Rouge or I will fly another carrier. Also expecting to have entertainment on the flight either music or TV they have nothing. You can bring an IPAD that you have download an APP on or rent one for $10 during your flight nothing when booking the flight said anything about this."
1756,I flew from Buenos Aires to London via Madrid in April. In brief: absolutely terrible experience. The airline managed to produce a 30 hours+ delay (flight to Madrid was cancelled) during which its staff at the airport acted completely incompetently. Barely anybody spoke English there was a 2 hours line to the check-in desk to get an information which bus was taking us to the hotel after the return to airport 24 hours later check-in counter opened only half an hour after arrival (their staff informed us that the responsible colleague has not arrived yet) and afterwards only one counter was opened for 200+ passengers. Worse though was the fact that after the flight was cancelled I clearly explained to the only English-speaking lady at the desk that I need to be in London on Monday morning in any case as I had an important meeting. She assured me that this will be taken care of and that the company will call me to the hotel to give me the details of a replacement flight. I never heard from her again and the company just couldn?™t care less. Generally this whole nightmare ended only after we persuaded the only reasonable person in the whole staff to book us on a flight with TAM instead. Otherwise we would miss yet another connection flight to London and instead of 30 hours delay it would have been closer to 40.
1757,"Flew Gatwick - Madrid - Havana and return. Flights out to Havana were fine. Staff were friendly and helpful lots of information given out. The chicken meal on the Madrid - Havana flight was one of the best I have had. The breakfast from Havana - Madrid was not very nice a dried up roll and a thick slice of tasteless meat. The return flight Havana - Madrid was a total different experience. We had a very fed up male member of the cabin crew. All the other cabin crew were great. Firstly he was very scruffy worn out shoes a cardigan which covered up his name badge a shirt which did not fit into his trousers properly. We were sat 3 rows from the rear of the plane by the time he got to us he was obviously fed up as he didn't offer us the bread rolls or drinks. He also did not offer any drinks to the people on the two rows behind us or the one next to us. Whilst the other crew members were still collecting the finished meals and drinks he turned off the lights. The crew members on the other side of the plane were only half way through collecting. During ""lights out"" my friend went to the toilet and wanted to stand for a few minutes to stretch her legs he rudely told her to go and sit down and ushered her back to her seat. This is a 9 hour flight and you need to have a stretch when you are stuck in a seat for that long. Overall I was very happy with Air Europa and would fly with them again. It is a shame that this one member of the crew let the side down."
1758,FRA-TRN in economy. Air Dolomiti is one of the best regional airlines around. excellent legroom and service.
1759,FRA-TRN in economy. Air Dolomiti is one of the best regional airlines around. excellent legroom and service.
1760,MUC-FCO: Booked a flight on Air Condor from Munich to Rome for 20 persons. Air Condor cancelled our flight but automatically rebooked us on Air Dolomiti. The flight was on time good snacks and nice flight attendants. I especially liked the way they boarded and deplaned from both the front AND rear of the aircraft.
1761,MXP-MUC on a BAe 146 Y class. Good legroom excellent catering even on such a short flight. Flight attendants not smiling but doing their job. Overall a good experience followed by a smooth and easy transit in Munich.
1762,I recently travelled to Mexico wasn't aware we were flying Air Rouge not that that was a big deal but you're almost sitting on top one another. No leg room but the worst was no TV to watch a movie - you could rent one but no thanks paid enough for the flight. It was a 5.5 hour flight so you think you would at least be able to watch a movie for free - not impressed!
1763,"AC1837 on May 5. Has anyone actually had a good Rouge experience. Mine certainly wasn't. I paid the full AC fare for a Rouge flight from YYZ to PHX (the only direct flight option) and sat on the plane at the gate for 3 hours while they tried to decide how to resolve their ""technical issues"". 3 hrs spent in a cramped seat working on a too-close tray table without a power source for my laptop. The end result was de-planning and then fending for ourselves to make alternative travel arrangements. Rouge did not cancel the flight - it took off 9 hrs after its originally scheduled departure. Basically Rouge is like a discount charter vacation service at full service prices with few planes available so if something goes wrong with yours prepare to camp out there's no back- up. What were they thinking?"
1764,AC421 Mar 2 Samana to Montreal. Very disappointed in my flight travelling back from Samana. I was in premium seating and my friend I was travelling with upgraded. However they were unable to confirm our seats together. We ended up sitting by two different passengers who did not what to trade seats. The flight attendant kept speaking only French to me. I do understand French but my language of choice is English. This happened several times. I won't discuss luggage problems as this will not be published.
1765,Traveled from Miami to Paris with a connection in Madrid and what a surprise Air Europa turned out to be. Flights left on time service was wonderful food was better then expected and the inflight entertainment was fantastic. We flew on Polish Airways new 787 and everything about that plane was wonderful. Will not hesitate to recommend and fly Air Europa again in the future.
1766,Business class. Terrible BRU check in by Skyteam counter. Old SN Brussels Airlines lounge (downstairs in Schengen Terminal). My first time in this new security and fast track. Embraer 195 pleasant good crew. Return check in and good IB lounge. Good food and drinks. Will recommend and will fly them again.
1767,Munich to Venice. Originally booked on Condor who cancelled the flight and automatically rebooked me with Air Dolomiti. The flight attendants were professional and very nice. The plane was clean departed and arrived on time and the food/snack service better than any meal/snack I've ever had on a flight in the US.
1768,MUC-TRN. Air Dolomiti has own check in gate area in MUC with Italian flair (espresso etc). Bussing from gate to aircraft in MUC was quick. Hand baggage can be delivered to A/C hold if not checked in. ATR-42 (or 72?). Leather seats quite a lot of legroom. Small snack served on evening service choice of drinks. FA's english was good. On time arrival in TRN. If they flew regional jets flight time could be reduced against Turboprops. Inflight magazine was well presented. All in all a pleasant flight for a late evening.
1769,AC1830 on May 4 2014. I am a regular customer of Air Canada on the Barbados-Toronto route. Like many of the other business travel regulars we were generally satisfied with the service on the route. The flight attendants knew what they were doing the pitch on the seats in economy and business was fine (even on the 319) and the in-flight entertainment system was a plus on the flight that can be over 5 hours. This new Rouge service is a huge step down in quality with no reduction in fares. The economy seats are too narrow and close together for anyone over 5 ft tall. The iPad based entertainment has a degraded selection of material. And any upgrade to their premium service is a joke. Yes two more inches in pitch but the seats are the same narrow width in economy. Even the overhead storage is reduced in the front of the plane. The flight attendants are obviously new and not yet up to speed. An absolute waste of money to pay for the upgrade and a waste of Upgrade points. The only safe bet is to get in the preferred seating row. Most of us are now looking to the alternative Westjet. I would not advise anyone to book the Rouge service if they have a choice.
1770,Venice to Toronto on August 23 2013. Air Canada stuck us on this flight on the return trip from Venice to Toronto. My husband is 6 ft 5 and my 3 sons are 6 ft 2 so needless to say they were all miserable. No entertainment Rude service. Really old plane. There was so little padding in the seats that any time you used the seat pocket you poked the person in front of you. Will never travel with Air Canada again.
1771,"AC1830 Toronto to Bridgetown 24 April 2014. AC1831 Bridgetown to Toronto 4 May 2014. Like many others posting I booked flights for myself and my husband months in advance of our April 2014 trip to Barbados. When I booked I paid for an Air Canada flight - not an Air Canada Rouge flight. As I understand it Air Canada Rouge didn't even fly into Barbados at the time I booked. We were subsequently bumped to Air Canada Rouge with no consultation and no refund. I had upgrade credits to get us to Premium Rouge so the trip down wasn't too bad (except for the lack of entertainment) but the trip back in economy was terrible. My husband was forced to sit sideways (to the extent possible) in order to avoid jamming his knees into the seat ahead. Clearly AC didn't get anyone over 6 feet to test the comfort of these seats before they decided to alter the planes. So we got a ""discount"" service with no discount!"
1772,We travelled Alicante-Madrid-Buenos Aires and return on Air Europa and being honest after booking we were dismayed at the poor online reviews. So it was a massive surprise to find that the cabin crew were friendly and extremely helpful the flights were spot on time the connections perfect and our luggage always arrived with us. The only downside was the food which was rather insipid compared to other airlines. Let me put it this way better than Air France or Iberia.
1773,I flew from Madrid to Porto on a lovely Embraer 145. The aircraft was small and cosy a little bit old but perfectly functional. It only has three seats per row two in the right side and one in the left. I was lucky and got one on the individual lane. The flight was pleasant on time and extremely quick (45 minutes) despite the weather was not too good. The comeback was on a Embraer 190 also on time and quick. It was a night flight and they kept the lights off so the journey was pleasant and relaxing. No services offered onboard it is nonsense on such a short trip.
1774,EZE-MAD and MAD-MXP. First flight from Buenos Aires to Madrid was in an old A330. Seat was regular and entertainment poor. Catering was the worst ever: in a 12hr flight they served one meal (2 star to be generous) and after 10hr only a little sandwich. Second flight Madrid to Milan was in a brand new A320 nothing to say. The good experience in a short range flight terrible in a long haul. Never again for a transocean flight.
1775,"Flew Rouge YYZ-CUN in Feb 14. Knew when we booked it was Rouge and had concerns but Husband is AC Elite and we ""always"" fly AC so we gave it a shot. Big mistake huge mistake. I am only 5'3"" and 125 lbs and even I found the seats awful. I had to stuff my jacket between my lower back and seat for support had back ache for 3 days afterwards. Paid for a vodka and sprite got the mini vodka and a little splash of sprite in a cup. For 6 bucks you would think you would get the whole can. Return flight sat on tarmac for 3 hrs getting a wheel fixed. Same as other posters first told 30 mins then 1 hr then 3 hrs. Seems mechanical problems a common issues. Hubby will still fly regular AC for business heaven help them if they bump him to a Rouge flight. We will fly some other airline for pleasure."
1776,Departed Toronto on Feb 12 flight Ac1812 returned AC1813 on Feb 28. Flew return Toronto to Cancun. In Toronto flight was overbooked by 10 people very crammed seats no leg or wiggle room. Wife has problem with back and suffered the whole flight to Cancun. Flight back to Toronto the person in front of wife leaned seat back due to closeness of her knees to the back of seat she was crushed. The remedy was to move the person that forced the seat into here and his 10 year old child to first class where they where given food and drinks while the wife had to suffer. Very poor service poor seats no wiggle room and no leg room.
1777,Outbound flight on May 1st AC 1820 return flight on May 5th AC 1821. I was recently Rouged on a flight to Cancun Mexico. I used 20 upgrade credits and when I selected my seats it clearly showed a standard executive class configuration of 2 wide seats per side. Imagine my surprise when I found the configuration to actually be the new slimline seats with a 3 seat configuration and a pillow placed on the centre seat. I feel that this is a blatant attempt to mislead and had I known that this would be the case would not have used the credits.
1778,"Got exactly what we paid for with AF. 45 mins late leaving ATL due to airport shutdown because of Thunderstorm. Seats OK, not great although better than Delta on the same route. Food OK, but took 2 hours from dep to start service-I always think AF should follow Delta's example here and start service on the late flights as soon as they can. IFE not the best. Service generally good, except for one minor complaint-you have to ask for water. Made up some time in air and arrived CDG 10 mins late. Luckily our connection to IST was in in the next terminal and we could fast track security, so our already short connection was comfortably made. CDG-IST about an hour late, but no reason given. I think the European business class is woeful in terms of seats. Basically economy seat with no middle passenger and no IFE for 3.5 hour flight. Apart from that everything was pretty much as expected"
1779,I flew from London Gatwick to Havana Cuba via Madrid. The flight London - Madrid was on time check-in went smoothly. In Madrid I had 1.5 hour for transfer which went quickly. We boarded the plane on time however then we were told we would have a one hour delay which was a bit annoying. I reserved my seat 13C in advance - it had extra leg room as it was in the Emergency row and I was very happy with it. The only minus is that the seats felt a bit hard and on a long flight it was a bit uncomfortable. On the way back I was not able to reserve the same seat so I sat in regular 18F - aisle seat. I felt the leg room was quite small (I am 172cm tall). The return flight was on time and we arrived in Madrid in 8.5 hours. The on board entertainment could be improved - there were only 2 movies on during 9.5 hour flight. Please bring your own headphones as you need to buy them otherwise! I was pleased with the food and I have to say that staff were very nice and helpful on both fights serving plenty of water. It is a low cost airline so you cannot expect same service as from more expensive ones but overall I was pleased with them and the fact that I saved nearly Â£200 makes you forget the little imperfections.
1780,LGW-MAD-GRU - Having done this journey direct from the UK I was dubious about the change in Madrid and sceptical about the Â£2k less difference in the BA price. Check was a bit gruff at Gatwick with the handling agents doing their best to ignore customers while discussing their weekend plans and gossiping about a poor member of staff who had just gone of shift . However the Lounges at Gatwick and Madrid were not as good as the Heathrow Terraces but much better than the rude and over booked facilities of the JFK Terraces. I felt the weak link here was the lounge in Sao Paulo on the way back which reminded me of a provincial airport with basic service and low quality decor. Air Europa may wish to consider changing this. The first thing that strikes you about this airline is the service and the pristine staff who respond to you every need as if their life depended on it  nothing was too much trouble. Dinner service was on a par with old BA first class with leather menus and five courses although the food was on a par with lesser Club World. The seat - was not a lie flat bed but very similar to Club World London City although the Air Europa Corporate colours are a bit garish for my taste. There were plenty of films to watch and an I pad if you ran out the regular on demand service. There was a the obligatory amenity kit comforter blanket and pillows at bed time. I cannot understand why the cabin was half empty! If I were considering another trip to South America I would seriously consider using Air Europa again - especially given the saving.
1781,Overall the airline is decent. I departed from Miami Int'l Airport to Oviedo Asturias with a stop in Madrid. What stood out to me was the lack of PTV entertainment. Food was okay. Don't expect too much from this airline.
1782,YUL-LAS return booked on Air Canada months ago converted to Rouge and refused to discount or refund flight to book elsewhere. Experience confirmed fears: heinous obvious decrease in legroom stripped of all entertainment including power outlets to stay plugged into streaming system IF it's working and IF you have an Apple device. Young and eager crew does not know what they're doing and their poor pay promises to keep turnover high and little improvement. AC management loves that they're still able to charge full Air Canada prices for discounted Rouge but that won't last. Certainly not for me. Actively booked away from AC - even mainline - on next 3 upcoming business/leisure flights.
1783,"I just flew from Vancouver to LAX on a Rouge flight. I booked with Air Canada because of my aeroplan points collection and my general good experience with the airline. I'm 6'5"" so legroom on even a 3 hour flight is important to my level of comfort. All airlines are relatively tight but this Rouge flight was a new level of discomfort. I could barely squeeze my knees into the available area with one knee spilling into my neighbour's area. Even sitting bolt upright I wasn't able to get my knees into the available area. Thank goodness I was seated next to a tiny woman. To give you an idea of the lateral space she fell asleep and her head fell right onto my shoulder. When the person ahead of me put their seat back the seatback was right in my face to the point that I was barely able to read. It was ridiculous and I'll never fly Rouge again or AC for that matter as I might be bumped to Rouge without notice. On the upside the flight staff were very nice but that only goes so far when I'm crammed into a seat like a sardine."
1784,"I flew from CDG to RUH. Flight was delayed one hour, service was excellent. Seats were old but comfortable, food was great and IFE was decent."
1785,"Smooth check-in at Madrid airport. Boarding was fast, no problem, although full flight. Nice crew, excellent catering, no plastic tableware. Average seat comfort. CDG to PVG the same experience - IFE outdated, poor screen and movie selection. Arrival the priority baggage last to arrive on the wrong belt. Overall, good experience"
1786,UX9118 MAD-TFN (23/9) and UX9049 TFN-MAD (03/10). Both flights were on Boeing 737-800 and on time. Online check in was efficient. Check in staff was friendly and changed my seat without additional costs. Crew was not friendly. They even didn't say hello when the people entered the plane (they were chatting). This didn't give a feeling of welcome (which I get when I fly KLM). English announcements were so worse that I didn't understand them at all. Surprisingly I got a free bottle of water when I asked for some water. Crew was very good in hiding themselves. I've only see them once to sell drinks and food.
1787,"Flew LGW-LPA return via Madrid. Got all of their types E195 LGW-MAD A332 MAD-LPA and return B738 MAD-LGW. The service was OK all flights on time. English announcements were very hard to understand except on LPA-MAD leg the crew on MAD-LGW leg were surprisingly poor in their English skills could not understand a request from the person sitting next to me for a tea with milk. This does not cause a particular issue though it is a Spanish Airline. The 738/E195 were far more comfortable than the A332's - I'm 6'2"" and rather thought those A332's were only specified for Europe flying - reading reviews apparently not. I'd avoid them long haul if there's a chance of getting one. But to be very positive their fares were spectacular. They were a clear Â£100 cheaper with luggage than any of Ryanair EasyJet or Norwegian and Â£150 cheaper than Iberia. Check in was easy everywhere. Connections were good. Flights were very well timed 10.00 departures both ways. Madrid makes for a longer journey than direct but that does not really bother me as long as I can arrive a decent hour which I did. I would definitely use them again for flying in Europe."
1788,My Wife and I flew from Barbados to Toronto on AC Rouge and I saw red. We had booked on Air Canada regular service and were switched to Rouge without our consent. The seats are very uncomfortable limited leg room and crammed. No audio no USB or electrical plug. I don't have and IPhone or IPad to download the AC Rouge Apps to see movie or listen to tunes. Flying 6 hours sitting on those seats killed my back and I was bored. For extra cash I will be flying WestJet. AC Rouge would be fine for short flights EG: Ottawa Toronto.
1789,Flew from YYZ to SJO longest 5.5 hrs ever. I have flown to SJO 7 times and that was the worst flight. The crew were very nice but that didn't make up for the cramped leg room and very uncomfortable seats. Luckily we all had iPads and could use the onboard entertainment system. The return flight was even worse we sat at the gate for an hour after boarding with no information then were told we had to leave the gate for a new flight coming in and we would be departing in 4-5 minutes which turned into 45 minutes. We waited 2 long hours for the wind to change direction so we could take off. Apparently the plane Rouge sends to San Jose Costa Rica is not big enough or powerful enough to take off full if the wind is blowing towards the mountains if they had tried we would have crashed into the mountains. This was told to me after the fact by someone extremely familiar with the planes used by Rouge. We have never experienced such a delay in all the years we have traveled to SJO back to Air Transat for us. So a 5 hr flight is now a 7 hr flight in uncomfortable cramped seats my six year old was very tired and upset after all that. This was our first experience with Rouge and our last.
1790,My husband and I recently took an Air Canada vacations flight to Costa Rica. We had never flown on Air Canada Rouge and had no idea how small and tight the seats were. Luckily because my husband has knee issues we paid extra for one of the extra leg room seats. But the entire return trip I had the person's knees sitting behind me pressing in the small of my back. Why would they do that to people who have to be on a plane for 5+ hours? It was my understanding that Air Canada offers free meals on flights over 2 hours - but nothing was offered. Given the length of the flight I expected more comfort and service.
1791,I flew from Barbados to Toronto on AC Rouge and I saw red. I didn't notice when I booked the flight that this was AC Rouge. The seats are very uncomfortable limited leg room and crammed. No audio no USB or electrical plug. I don't have and IPhone or IPad to download the AC Rouge Apps to see movie or listen to tunes therefore I read Enroute. This was the worst flight ever! Flying 6 hours sitting on those seats killed my back and I was bored. For extra cash I will be flying West Jet. AC Rouge would be fine for short flights EG: Ottawa ??Toronto. AC lost my business!
1792,"Purchased premium economy seats with my husband six months in advance of trip. Flight out was end of June 2015 SFO to Paris. We chose two seats together at time of booking in January. Upon check-in, we were told we were on standby, even though it was 3 hours before boarding. When we got to gate, we were told to wait until boarding for our seat assignment. We were seated separately. Flight crew allowed us to switch seats. Return trip: Checking in at Barcelona, we were told that we had seats on flight to Paris, but were on standby for Paris-San Francisco segment. Upon arrival at CDG, we spoke with Air France staff. We were behind a line of other passengers in same situation. Staff rude and dismissive, and said, ""Make a complaint on our website."" Again, we were given seats apart and had to bargain with passengers on board to be seated together. Many singletons were seated in the group of 2 seats (window-aisle) on left and right. However, we were seated in the middle of the plane, three rows apart. We booked our tickets through a travel agent, who booked us on Delta, operated by Air France. Turns out, when you book on Delta, Air France bumps you to the bottom in terms of seating priority. So much for Sky Team."
1793,"Flight was cancelled so never even boarded. Great customer service from AF at Orly so we took the train instead and afterwards made our claim for refund. Not only did they refund the ticket and reimburse us for the train tickets and hotel, but they gave us Â£250 flight vouchers as a gesture of goodwill. All of this in less than a week. Great airline on the other flights we did use them (SXB-LYS on a CRJ1000 and LYS-TLS on an A320). I would recommend them!"
1794,"Business class, what a joke! Economy seats just leaving the middle seat vacant does not make it business class. The only good thing I can find to say is that it was on time and safe. Food was better left alone."
1795,Myself and my boyfriend flew a few days ago from Gatwick to Madrid - Salvador - Santiago to start our year backpacking. Our journey was awful before we even boarded the plane. We were told we would be refused entry to the country and handed back our passports in such a rude manner by the woman at the check-in desk. This was all because she couldn't read the itinerary properly. She then said we could still be refused entry in Santiago. This filled us with dread and worry throughout our entire flight which was 30 hours in all. We had no problem at all entering the country! Here are a few more reasons why our flight was such a hideous experience: All 3 flights were delayed and nothing was communicated about this and no hint of an apology was offered at any point. The entertainment system was so bad. My earphone socket didn't work. When mentioning this to a member of staff it was greeted by a shrug of the shoulders and no care about it. My boyfriend's entertainment system kept on freezing then rebooting. The food was vile. No communication was given at any point on how long it was till landing on both long haul flights. I would never fly with this airline again. A nightmare from start to finish.
1796,I flew from Paris to Madrid and then Madrid to New York. From Paris to Madrid we flew on a Boeing 737-800 the standard workhorse of medium distance flights. Nothing was served on this flight and there was no entertainment. No problem. Both flights (outward and return) were on time and uneventful. Staff spoke French and Spanish. The Madrid airport is quite large and a lot of walking between terminals was required. No problem though. Both the Outward flight and Return flight were on time if not early to arrive. Very good. Both were Airbus A320-200 with the 2x4x2 seating configuration. Outward to JFK we each had our own individual entertainment systems. Bring your own headsets if you don't want to buy them for ??. Wine with dinner is free. Wow. Even on American Airlines you have to pull out your wallet on transatlantic flights. The return trip from JFK to Madrid did not have individual entertainment systems but rather 5 screens that showed one program. Not a film but rather a documentary about the history of the Ferrari automobile. From JFK there is no online check in possible whatsoever. I would advise getting to Terminal 4 of JFK early and standing in line. The Air Europa desk at Terminal 4 opens at 7 pm (for the 10 pm flight) but at about 6.45 pm they allowed us to start checking in. The Air Europa check in is located in aisle 6 of the check in area near El Al. I paid about ??00 for my return ticket during the height of the summer travel season when all other airlines were demanding over ??000. I saved some money and the trip was fine. Interestingly arriving in Madrid there was no immigration whatsoever. We just stepped off the flight and literally walked out the door. There was no border control whatsoever not even the sight of a single border control agent or police dog.
1797,Flew YYC to LAS a couple days after these flights were Rouged. Flight attendants were horrible either the PA system was poor or their speaking ability or both. The announcements in French would make my elementary French teacher cringe but it wasn't like the English was that much better either it felt unrehearsed and like they were reading off post it notes and need to pause every few words to find their place. The lack of IFE was archaic for a new airline and was the clincher for me to not fly this airline again.
1798,"Recently flew ""Rouge"" and got ""rouged"". No leg room for anyone over 6 ft tall very narrow seats very limited overhead compartments for small hand luggage. In fact before boarding people were asked to volunteer to have their hand luggage checked. I bought a full service regular seat and got downgraded without being consulted. Will avoid or find alternatives to anything ""rouge"" related."
1799,I was traveling from Ottawa to Las Vegas via Calgary and was told at check in my connecting flight from Calgary to LV was on AC Rouge. When I complained I was told that there is nothing that could be done other than refund my ticket and cancel the trip?œif I was not happy?? As I had meetings planed this was not an option and one which I personally think they use to most BC travellers who are not happy. When I got to Calgary I spoke to the AC representative at customer service and she advised me to write to AC and complain. She told me that this is a budget carrier so don't set your expectations high. As a traveler who clocked up more than 150k miles last year with AC they have certainly made me consider my carrier of choice. The seats were awful the food the same bland offering as usual cabin dated but the staff were attentive and seemed to go out of their way to serve maybe I drew a good hand on this flight. I will reiterate what the agent at customer service stated to me ?œthis is a budget carrier?�so don't set your standards too high.
1800,"After 3 hours in the plane waiting for repairs the hostess announced that we needed to disembark, we wait another 3 hours at the gate without any clear info on what was happening. People started getting upset and complained and in exchange they got a 8 Euro coupon for a drink, many others did not realize this and did not get anything. Then they made an announcement saying that the flight was canceled and told us to go to the main departure check-in desk, in broken English that not very clear. They did not say which desk, whether or not we had to claim the luggage. At 8pm eventually we reach the departure gate, we were rerouted, got a poor motel and a 16 euro coupon for dinner, a total disaster. Got the luggage 36 hours later."
1801,"AF has started a new route from Vancouver to Paris CDG where we were supposed to take a connecting AF flight to Nice. Unfortunately, the AF connection was impossible to make despite four of us running all the way. No-one met us at the gate to get us to our flight. No-one knew where the connector flight left from although I had found that information by myself. We were told by a steward on the plane that you could walk to the next flight. You cannot - you have to take a train, clear border control then security again. We were told this would all take place in Nice - wrong again.  The next flight to Nice was joyfully cancelled - no reason given. The third flight was one hour late so in all we spent seven hours in a sweltering CDG trying to make a one hour journey to Nice,  after a nine-hour flight from Vancouver. Our daughter was exhausted after the flight and felt faint. We called the first aid medics in CDG who were great.  The only response we got from Air France was when I took to Twitter to express my frustration. The flights themselves were ok - nothing more - but when basic standards of transportation aren't met it makes any other rating irrelevant. "
1802,"BHX-ORD-CDG 27th June. No major concerns or upsets but certainly much room for improvement. The online check-in was very straightforward (I appreciated the e-mail confirming that check in had opened) and there were no issues there. The outward leg from BHX to CDG was fine, didn't expect to be served a snack but the croissant was practically inedible and thrown straight in the bin. The organisation at CDG was lacking. There was a delay of 45 minutes on the ground with no explanation from the staff, then the gate of departure was changed to a gate that was already boarding a separate flight to Dubai, with the new gate's screen not being updated to reflect this. This caused a large rush of people and a lot of anger and confusion, and although the staff did make an announcement confirming the Chicago-bound passengers were to board first, this didn't feel like enough as a lot of people remained confused and unsure of what was happening. We were then delayed for a further hour on the tarmac, although we were kept updated by the captain regarding this. Seats were okay, food was okay, a good selection of entertainment but the quality of the screens is poor and the sets only designed for the headsets handed out so sound quality was abysmal on normal headphones. There's a good selection of drinks (including complementary alcohol) and the flight staff were friendly and attentive. Not the best trans-atlantic flight I've ever had, but far from the worst. Return flight (BOS-CDG-BHX) was also Air France but was code shared with Delta and Flybe, so will be reviewing separately."
1803,I took this flight from Madrid to Cancun. I was surprised in the first flight when I was awarded an upgrade so the experience in Business Class was far more satisfactory than in the Economy Cabin. Economy Cabin space is pretty fair no individual entertainment and very fair quality and variety of food served. Thankfully the return flight was during the night and I was tired so I could sleep. I would suggest people to think twice prior to buying a long-haul flight in economy class.
1804,MAD-BRU-MXP-MAD - C Class. Pleasantly surprised with this airline. All 3 legs were good. Check-in plus on board services. Hopefully they will keep it up. A little harsh on the language skills but not that much of a problem. They tend to overbook. Quite a breeze to fly them. All in all ok.
1805,I flew Gatwick to Madrid and then to Lima - out on 23 July return 12 August. Outbound UX 75 was two hours late leaving Madrid so departed 02.00. For a 12 hour flight there were no individual screens for film viewing but service was OK seats very close and I'm only 5 and a half feet tall. Return UX 76 timing was good food just about OK seating better it seemed to me. Service though - the steward on our economy section was unfriendly curtly told me I would have to pay 1 euro for a second plastic cup of wine. Coffee for 'breakfast' was almost cold and he served about 2cm of it into the paper cup. Unpleasant. The toilets were not checked and ran completely out of paper supplies so I had to go and ask. The female attendants seemed to be more courteous than the male. Surely checking of toilets should be part of their flight routine. Baggage arrived correctly.
1806,I originally booked a regular Air Canada return flight between Vancouver (YVR) and Los Angeles (LAX). While the flight to LAX was all that I expect from Air Canada (including meal-for-purchase and in-seat movies) unbeknownst to me the return portion of the trip was changed to an Air Canada Rouge flight - meaning no meal-for-purchase no in-seat movies not even any orderly boarding of the aircraft plus the flight was an hour late to boot). I did not pay for an AC Rouge flight and certainly wasn't prepared for absolutely zero amenities on the flight. I have been a loyal Air Canada customer for decades but will never book or fly on Air Canada Rouge again. Clearly though booking what I thought was a regular AC flight didn't mean anything as the flight was changed with no notice to me or any other options. Shame on Air Canada for doing this to customers!
1807,Flew to Florida on flight AC1860 May 2/14 at 6.30am return on 7th. I'll take the friendly service of this non- union staff any day of the week over that of the staff from its parent company. Onboard entertainment using your own device is a brilliant way to keep costs down. I'll forego a few first world luxuries over being treated like a third class citizen. The cheery Rouge uniforms matches that of their customer service. I'm excited to have an option under Aeroplan outside of AC.
1808,YVR-LAX. Probably the most uncomfortable and worst seats on any airline. I am average build and height and I could barely fit in my seat. On-flight entertainment was not functioning. No real price savings. Thankfully there are other carriers that service LAX from YVR.
1809,"I booked my tickets for myself and my husband in August 2014 for a trip in June 2015. We always get to the AF check-in counter at Dulles International and discover that despite having booked our seats together, despite having the same last name, despite paying for the tickets with the same credit card, and despite paying full price we are not seated together. And I had called 3 times to confirm that had reserved seats together. Our record was separated and we were seated apart. By good fortune, the woman who had the seat that I was supposed to have was right behind me at the airport. She had booked her ticket 5 months after I did, through a travel agent. Further conversation revealed that she had AF Flying Blue status, although she's a US citizen. It appears from our chat, that AF allows its own customers to reserve seats in business class up to a few hours before departure and thus bump passengers like me and my husband, paying passengers, at will. This leaves the check-in staff at Dulles to flounder for explantions as to why we are separated. In addition, when the check-in staff reassigns us, the computer system is never updated timely enough for the gate agent to recognise the new seats. Confusion at the gate. Embarrassment."
1810,"Crew excellent ??administration incompetent. We flew business class Hong Kong to Paris CDG, and contrary to the reviews the crew were excellent, they were happy, congenial, efficient and attentive. The food was also excellent. However the main reason we chose Air France was because of their new seats in business class. To be certain we phoned the Air France office before booking the flights and after 14 minutes double checking the Air France administrator assured us the seats on that flight were the new ones ??wrong, they were NOT. The old seats were uncomfortable, noisy, and out of date. We wasted our money.  Air France don?™t even know what seats they have in their aircraft, think twice before you fly."
1811,"Recently flew Birmingham to Paris CDG. It is only a short flight which was good considering how uncomfortable the seats were. The seat was far too narrow. I'm not a particularly large guy, but this seat was way too narrow. We were served a sandwich and drink during the flight. The sandwich was revolting and served on bread. Ordinarily I like Air France but this service was poor."
1812,Business Class Rome-Buenos Aires with a stopover in Madrid. Business class is almost an unmitigated disaster. They have zero interest in serving Business class customers. Rome check in - They have a Sky Priority counter for Business but no agent at that counter. Rome-Madrid - On this first leg I was booked in economy because Business was full. I was told to check at the gate and if something comes up in Business they will of course switch me as I had a full fare Business ticket. I checked upon boarding and they did have a free seat but without any explanation said they told me could not switch me. Could not give me reason. One of the bathrooms was out of order so 1 bathroom for 200 passengers in Economy. Rome Boarding - Only 1 person to check through the 200+ passengers. Madrid-Buenos Aires in Business - Antiquated seats and IFE (probably from the 1990?™s). Seat recline but with feet hanging down so uncomfortable to sleep. Food quality and service was ok onboard. Only non negative comment I have. Overall they charge normal business class fares but offer very little in return. Will never fly them again and suggest Business travelers to avoid them at all costs. Arrival and departure at their base airport Madrid - Amazingly they use buses so I presume they don't pay the fee to use the bridges. Very uncomfortable.
1813,Super Elite traveller purchased a business class ticket from Montreal to Cancun back in October 2013 (for an April 2014 trip). In March 2014 this flight became a rouge route - and this is not what I purchased originally. Rouge seats service IFE are not the same. You could not entertain a conversation with the staff in French. Wifi did not work at all so no IFE.
1814,Air Canada has really missed the mark with Rouge. I understand this is supposed to be a leisure low cost alternative for Canadian going to southern destinations or Europe however I have found the fare is generally the same as full service Air Canada with all the benefits stripped away. The Entertainment system rarely works and the movie selection is very old/out dated. The legroom in rows 20 and back is very limited and if the person in front of you reclines you can barely open your tray. The food and beverage service is exactly the same Air Canada free drinks food for purchase.
1815,"April 28 YYZ-NAS. I booked Rouge Premium. We boarded fairly quickly and efficiently were offered juice and water while still at the gate newspapers as well pushed-back and took off on time. FAs were friendly perky and a bit informal and their service throughout the flight was courteous and efficient. Food and drinks were exactly the same as Air Canada mainline Business. The big downside of Rouge are the seats I'm 6ft 3 and weigh 220lbs. I had just enough legroom so my knees did not bang into the seat in front of me and I was able to cross my legs no problem. There is definitely less legroom between the Rouge Business seats and the Air Canada Business seats. The seats are pitiful on the recline only 3 inches and is pretty useless. The seats on Rouge are called ""New Slimline Seats"" and they definitely are slimline especially on the cushion aspect as well as much narrower since they have jammed 3 seats across into the same space that used to have 2 across. There is absolutely no lumbar support so lower backpain is the reward after a couple of hours. 2 other aspects about the seats the actual length front to back of the seat is less than normal so no support for the upper thighs which can be problematic for some. No inflight TV screen on the seatbacks just the foldaway meal table a-la 1970s aircraft seats along with a couple of pockets. My Rouge flight was only half-full so as I said service and food were up to Air Canada mainline standards in Business class but the Rouge business class seats comfort and space are a definite step down. I paid the same airfare for less legroom less comfortable smaller seat and less space as I paid 4 months ago for a standard business class seat and space on the same route with regular Air Canada. I will only fly Rouge on flights of less than 3 hours and only if I can get a seat in the Rouge ""business"" class and only if their are no other airline choices."
1816,"Everything was fine. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. I had a vegetarian meal and they served me first, which was nice. The food was okay, but not great. The seats were comfortable."
1817,"I spent almost $1K more than the economy fare to upgrade my mother and myself to premium economy. Big mistake. Seats were very uncomfortable. Seat arms could not be raised and lowered, so even though we had four seats in the row, we could not truly get comfortable. Food was awful. Service was much improved from a previous flight on Air France. Flew economy on the way home and actually found it more comfortable as we had a row of three seats to ourselves. Seat arms could be raised. That being said, the seats were narrow and very hard. Clearly an extra row as added to up the body count. Service was very good. Food was better, perhaps because it was prepared in Paris and not Vancouver."
1818,"Short 2-day visit to Paris to attend Le Bourget Air Show. I bought my ticket 1 month in advance with the new ""mini"" tariff which gives you no Sky Team miles and no possibility to check your baggage but is a good saving since the total cost of my trip was comparable to a low cost carrier at the end. It has been a while since my last time with AF and I am fully satisfied with this short hop: very professional and smiling crew, nice and clean plane and on-time departures/arrivals. Will surely fly again for European destinations while for long haul flights I still have other preferences."
1819,This June was the first time I travelled with Air Europa from Buenos Aires to London and back. On The outward journey I was allowed and paid for extra baggage but on return this was not allowed not even if it had been a few kilos! However a couple travelling with a little boy were allowed to take 6 large suitcases (paying of course for the extra 3) is this fair? How can this be? Why wasn't I told that I could take it but not bring it back? What is the reason for such a ridiculous rule? The flight from Madrid to Buenos Aires had at least 25 empty seats two of which were next to me. In spite of the kind and friendly cabin crew this ruined my holiday. The economy of flying with this airline is no longer an attraction to me and I will not be considering flying with you again or recommending others to do so.
1820,Caracas-Madrid-Amsterdam round trip. Four flights scheduled with this airline one of them with KLM in the Sky Team Alliance which was the only one that departed on time. Caracas-Madrid flight left 2 hours late this made me miss my connection to Amsterdam and with direct train to final destination. Returning from Amsterdam to Madrid flight left with 1 hour late. Connection from Madrid to Caracas 3 hours late There was no compensation or lunch. All passengers in transit to other cities in Venezuela missed their connections. The meals were scarce badly prepared and presented. No staff support to passengers related with the consequences of their tardiness.
1821,Madrid to JFK. I fly Madrid - New York at least 4 times a year and this was the worst flight experience I have had. I was surrounded by a group of about 20 middle school students. They were all standing sitting on each other's laps kneeling on their seats and yelling across the aisles. Obviously this was not the fault of Air Europa but I have never been on a flight where passengers were allowed to be out of their seats like that for the entire flight. I asked the flight attendant if she could say something to them and she responded that she couldn't really do anything. She murmured something about finding me another seat and never returned. I later found out the flight was not full and my seat could have easily been changed. My seat wasn't aligned properly so I had to place my feet on either side of the seat in front of me which was uncomfortable. The seats didn't have individual TVs which isn't such a big deal. Unfortunately the American-made inflight movie was only available dubbed in Spanish. I asked the flight attendant which channel was the English channel because I could not find it after scrolling through all of the options. She vaguely muttered that it should be available and said she would go ask and once again didn't return. This flight cost me about the same as most others I have taken on this route but the customer service was abysmal. Equally expensive flight for worse experience. I will be avoiding Air Europa in the future.
1822,Las Vegas to Calgary April 29th. If our experience on a Rouge flight is any indication this Air Canada endeavour is a huge bust. We fly Air Canada a lot and this was without question the most uncomfortable flight we have had. We arrived at the airport to discover our full fare booking (made 3 months prior) had been changed to a low cost??Rouge flight. The 319 plane was cramped with uncomfortable seats absolutely no leg room and no ventilation. Average height people found their knees jammed into the seat ahead of them and it was impossible to bend over to place or retrieve items from under the seat. Heaven help you if the person in front of you reclined their seat even the small degree they move. No entertainment (unless you wanted to rent a tablet) and no power to the seats if you wanted to use your own just topped the cake. Air Canada has gone too far trying to cram as many people as possible into a plane. We could not wait to get off this flight and will never fly Rouge again.
1823,Tampa to Toronto on Apr 27th. Terrible describes it in one word. Seats are terrible and morale with travellers is contagious I am super elite now for a number of years and feel married to Air Canada. I travel YYT to TPA at least 10 times a year and I really don't like WestJet. However WestJet is superior to this. Business class is a joke and prices are Air Canada regular not discounted like the service. I am sorry but they have lost my vote.
1824,Flight was from LAS to YYZ in April 2014. This was probably my worst experience with Air Canada. Cramped and uncomfortable seats little to no ventilation an aircraft that was probably 20 years past its prime and flight attendants that seemed like they just wandered in off the street and were given uniforms. I feel very fortunate that we didn't have to find out how the flight attendants would have responded to an emergency situation. As with others the flight was changed after booking but at the same fare. Just a terrible overall experience and I couldn't wait for it to be over. I have flown with Air Canada as much as possible for over 25 years - this was truly the worst and I will simply refuse to fly with Rouge again.
1825,"Rouge flight from Tampa to Toronto on 27 April 2014. I am a frequent flyer Elite 50K and most to and from that destination. First experience with Rouge! Best word to describe my experience ""horrible"". Without a doubt the most uncomfortable flight in a full-sized aircraft ever. 6' 11/2"" (there are taller) my tailbone pressed against back of seat and knees wedged against seat ahead. Could not move for almost 3 hrs. And I mean I could not move. As I recall even WestJet has more space. Will be seeking out other means to get to FL. The bottom line is important but this tactic will in the end loose them their most frequent customers. Do they care?"
1826,"A320 short haul London to Paris. Professional cabin attendant, attentive as well. Flight smooth. Free alcohol even for flights less than 1 hour. Excellent, overall satisfied."
1827,"Just days before my departure, Air France changed 3 of the 4 legs of my flight. The result was missed connections, forced stay in Charles de Gaulle airport for 10 hours, extra night in a hotel, and a day late arriving home. Instead of pushing everyone onto a later flight thus ensuring missed connections, why not push everyone to an earlier flight to secure the connections? The food and service dos not make up for the inconvenience. Never again Air France."
1828,"Flight from Dublin to CDG was on time and very comfortable. Nice snack with drinks served on this short flight. Air France lounge in CDG terminal 2E not good. Very small selection of food and limited selection of drinks. Lounge was very busy. Champagne served after boarding. Seats comfortable, only 14 seats in the business class cabin. Flight was almost 2 hours late due to one of the pilots being sick and waiting for a replacement one. Business class were the last to board the plane. Food selection not good, a lot of fish dishes. Earphones are permanently wired to your seat so they cannot be removed for cleaning. A lot of ear wax fell out of my earphones. Not nice! Seat was angled flat, not very comfortable while trying to sleep. Entertainment on the journey out was good but on my return, the aircraft was older so had smaller screens and less choice. Staff were friendly and attentive but everything else was a let down. Lounge in Havana was disgraceful. No food, only a few drinks in the fridge, lounge and toilets were filthy. I don't think I will fly this airline again."
1829,MUC-SSA via Madrid Barajas: As it was the best option both time - and price-wise we booked Air Europa for our trip to the World Cup. Due to the ratings my expectations were low I even feared to not arrive in Brazil on time! Back in Germany I see this airline in a different light: the seats on the regional flight (Embraer 190) had sufficient leg-room on the overseas flight (A330) it was so comfortable that I slept like a baby. All four flights were 100% on time and last but not least the crew was friendlier than on the other two Spanish carrier I chose before. What I annoyed me a bit was that headphones were not provided free of charge.
1830,I have flown Air Europa several times over the past few years to Santiago de Compestela La Coruna and Barcelona. The customer service is consistently below average. It is a typical low cost airlines with no free drinks or snacks. They are a member of Skyteam but they have never processed the miles with their partner on any of my flights without requiring numerous calls. Overall a below average experience.
1831,PUJ-MAD on May 20th 2014. The worst flight we have taken! A330 Aircraft tight without operative APU awful comfort bad food and crew very basic! Delayed without any assistance for 4 hours standing on the line at the check-in desks they made us pay a 30 dollar fee per person to go back to Europe.
1832,We booked with Air Canada in August 2013 for a return trip Toronto - Tampa. The return flight was changed to Rouge the day before we left. The seats are horribly close. 5 inches from knee to seat in front. Lack of food service. Took hours for the one attendant to get a drink of even water to us. I will never fly Air Canada again.
1833,I have flown Rouge twice in the last two months on business. The airplanes were old and under-staffed. It took over 2 hours to get a refreshment. The App-based entertainment was pathetic - perhaps it works for those with smart devices (which 75% of people do not have) but try sitting with a laptop on your food tray in a seat that is far too close to the seat in front of you and you will not be impressed.
1834,AC1851 Toronto to Las Vegas April 17th. Wifi kept on cutting out and finally never worked. The service was very slow no one passing in the alleys. The flight attendant call button on all seats was non functional until I complained about it and then it was turned on 2.5 hrs into the flight. Bathrooms are dated and not very clean ran out of paper towels halfway through the flight and never replaced. Price is similar to Air Canada flights yet Air Canada Rouge is like a third world airline. I had to ask 3 times for decaf coffee over a period of 2 hours. Very poor customer service. It is unacceptable that on a long flight both the entertainment system and service are terrible.
1835,"Return flight very long. No possibilty to check in online so no possibilty to prebook the seats online. At the airport in Pointe ? Pitre we flew to Fort de France with Air Antilles - from Pointe ? Pitre we did not have the chance to print the Air France boarding tickets from a ticket machine as it is only possible from the departure airport, meaning from Fort de France. So once landing in Fort de France we got our flight ticket from the ground staff but they forgot our bus ticket as we had to change from airport once arrived in Paris. We asked it to the staff at the boarding who nicely gave it to us. Onboard we seated in the middle row in the middle seats - unfortunately not so comfortable, not much places for the legs and going out was quite an adventure (bags on the way and headphone wires annoying). I was freezing on flight as I was seatting in draft, even the blanket did not help! Fortunately the staff on board was very nice and helpful.  No unpleasant surprise. "
1836,"The flight experience was good. The airplane was new, the food better than average and the flight attendants very friendly and helpful. But, unfortunately, I did the mistake of buying a combined air and rail ticket from Air France. From Strasbourg to Paris by TGV (operated by SNCF) and from Paris to my final destination by plane (and the same for the return). What a nightmare! AF did not inform me that I had to get a boarding pass for the train. And the boarding pass that they sent via email was not a valid boarding pass; I was supposed to get a new one from the airport, not only for the plane but also for the train. And the train staff were rude in asserting that I didn't have a either a boarding pass, or a train ticket. Showing them my perfectly valid rail and air ticket and the printed boarding pass AF sent, did not sway them. They made me pay a onboard TGV ticket at a price about 50% of my total ticket. Reaching SDG, I went straight to the AF ticket counter to protest. They were indifferent and declared that they could do nothing (I wonder what they are there for). They did not even have a complaint form. It was the worst airline experience of my life. Air France made everything very complicated, requiring many steps, which fortunately on the way back I knew and performed."
1837,"Kindly welcome. Departure on time, arrival before schedule. Appreciated captain announcements, clear and sincere. Flight staff quick and nice. Food and beverage limited but of good quality. Flight quiet, landing smooth! Good experience."
1838,BCN-LIM via MAD. If you pay budget prices expect a budget airline. Each of my four flights left pretty much on time (a one hour delay between Madrid and Lima on the outbound). The food on MAD-LIM was more than edible and plenty of drinks provided but I would advise bringing some of your own snacks on board. The airline doesn't provide entertainment options bar a shared screen showing a couple of movies in Spanish. Overall the experience was satisfactory and I have had less pleasant flights with bigger brand carriers.
1839,JFK-MAD and vice versa. I was hoping to get some sleep and if the seats weren't so tight that could have been possible. Oh well I guess I'm not fit to be sleeping on airplanes. It would have been nice to have an individual TV but not a big deal each seat had a radio with a few music channels and a movie was on the overhead screens. They gave you a nice little blanket and pillow which I would hope were clean. Dinner was a choice between chicken or pasta dish. In the morning they offered a turkey and cheese croissant sandwich and muffin hot and cold beverages. People complain about airline food  but I found it to be wonderful. The cabin crew took good care of you. I got up like 3 times to ask for more water and it was given to me with no issues. People classify Air Europa as a budget airline but I was very happy. They were accommodating at the airport checkin desk asking us if we had preference to what seat type we wanted.
1840,Just flew Air Europa to and from retro Havana. The experience was no way as bad as other reviews suggest. It was much like any other flight and better than some budget airlines. I didn't manage to watch any TV (personal seat back) as I couldn't figure it out but I could have asked I suppose - other people managed OK. The staff were friendly and offered drinks but I admit we avoided the food. On the way back I was even able to stretch out and sleep but we didn't have our own TV screens. (not a problem on a night flight). Catching your connection is stressful (We made it with minutes to spare) but that is Madrid airports fault as you have to queue and have your passport and hand luggage checked again (and they don't rush themselves). All in all not too bad but if you want to avoid any hassle and stress pay the extra and fly direct.
1841,They pack you in like cattle. Flight attendants allowed passengers in back rows to place their overhead luggage in the front overhead bins - where are these passengers in the front rows suppose to put their luggage? No entertainment - they rent you an ipad or whatever for $10 - money money money. And not even a cookie or titbit to go with the 'free' beverage. We will never fly Air Canada rouge again and perhaps not even Air Canada if it can be helped.
1842,"On a recent flight from San Diego to Toronto I was not informed that I would be on Air Canada Rouge - which I consider a ""discount"" carrier after my experience. My flight was booked months ago on Air Canada so I was surprised of not only the change to Rouge but a time change also. Good thing I checked in advance as the flight left earlier. The first eyebrow raising experience was when the pre-flight announcement indicated that our flying time was more than the gate-to-gate time. I only had about 2"" from my knees to the seat back in front of me which made it impossible to access anything stowed under the seat in front of me. I was cold and I could see others were reaching for their jackets too to cover their laps and legs. I was surprised also at the lack of in-flight entertainment. I also felt the flight attendant's uniforms didn't look smart or professional. I would not choose to fly again on Air Canada Rouge & I am relating my experience to whomever will listen. I feel Air Canada has made a mistake in introducing these so-called cost-saving measures. I feel many customers will be lost to competitors."
1843,"Flew from NAS-YYZ on flight 1833 and I can honestly say that this was the most uncomfortable flight and most disappointing in-flight experience that I have seen. Sat down in my seat and could had to sit at an angle for the whole flight because my knees would not fit in the seat pitch (and I am only 5'10!). There is no screen and no power source on these flights but they provided entertainment through iPads. Fortunately I had the most up-to- date Air Canada app so I could access the entertainment free of charge. Seat were beyond uncomfortable and the head flight attendant was rude beyond belief. I found it funny that she had to read the ""scripted"" relaxed announcements. I am an Altitude 50K Aeroplan member and have literally flown thousands of flights and I have never been so disappointed with the in-flight experience I had with Air Canada rouge. To anybody who wants anything near a comfortable flight: do NOT book a AC rouge flight. Book Westjet or a US-based airline."
1844,I flew from Montreal to Las Vegas in premium. Service was terrible and entertainment was even worse. If flight attendants make an announcement your Ipad freezes if the announcement is longer than 1 min you must restart the movie or show from the beginning. Very sad that Air Canada would attach their name to such poor service when people are so use to have great service on Air Canada.
1845,"I last took Air France in September 2003 from London to Moscow via Paris and it was an uneventful 5-hour journey to say the least. Fast forward to June 10, 2015, I flew Air France (AF 254) from Singapore to Jakarta and it was a smooth and comfortable experience. We boarded early, cabin crew was courteous and friendly, the inflight entertainment was superb with so many choices of programs and extremely easy-to-use touch screen. The food (cold noodle salad with bread and chocolate cake) could be better though. Would definitely consider Air France for my next journey. Love the stylish safety video!"
1846,"Husband and myself, both seasoned travellers now in our seventies. First time on Air France. From check-in at Heathrow through to Havana we found staff disinterested, dismissive and often just plain rude. When we fly for leisure we like to relax with a few drinks. My husband likes a beer or two and I like a nice gin and tonic or vodka and tonic. On a 10hr flight we were offered one drink with our meal. I was told there were no spirits on board and that beer was limited. After the initial drinks service (nearly an hour after take off) and the mediocre meal service (no choice of meal), we were not offered any other drinks. I found a member of the crew in one of the galleys much later and managed to het a beer for my husband and some water for myself. The return journey was as bad if not worse. And to add insult to injury our bags did not make the transit at CDG and we did not get them until the 15th because the company that Air France uses to deliver bags ""Does not work at weekends""!"
1847,"Being the first customers at check-in we were given the opportunity to upgrade to C for a nominal fee and Flying Blue miles which we happily did considering the very affordable surcharge. As on the inbound flight in Premium Economy, service and food were just superb. Our seats were in the middle section of a 2-3-2 row. As the aircraft was not fitted out with the most recent business class seats, the seats still were angled and would not get fully flat but were comfortable enough. One negative point: there was no screen to provide privacy in case you sit next to a stranger. After manageing to escape the labyrith of CDG we boarded the short flight to Berlin where the economy service was just basic. We were very impressed by AF's long-haul food and beverage service and staff attitude which have made AF one of our preferred airlines for future travels."
1848,"Terrible experience seats are very small and crammed in. Pretty much same as Sunwing layout but seats are more uncomfortable. No TV screens you have to bring your own iPad apparently to access movies (and sit it on your lap or table tray - did not try this out but hear it did not work well). On way back to Toronto from Orlando (flight 1863 Sunday April 20th) there was a 10 hour flight delay due to mechanical problems. So instead of arriving home at 1pm we got home at midnight. I can understand weather delays or other emergency delays but this was ridiculous. The part they were missing was originally ""a small thing that should be fixed in 30 mins"" then that turned into another hour then another 2 hours then another 7 hours. I'm sure they knew at the start it would be a 10 hr delay - and had we been told we could have left airport and spent day at Universal Studios with our friends instead of hanging around airport. My hunch is that given the planes are older the delays are not unusual. One good thing: The staff were friendly. Overall the flights are way too expensive given the service provided and uncomfortable seats."
1849,Rouge Flight from SJD-YYZ in Rouge plus no J offered. Terrible inflight service. The crew did one service up the aisle selling meals and then disappeared for the rest of the 5 hour flight. They closed the curtains to the front galley for the whole flight which made it awkward to use the front washroom. They were visibly annoyed when they had to respond to passengers call button. Entertainment system did not work for half the flight. I will fly another airline which has real first class seating instead of Rouge anywhere. I am an SE / MM and this leaves me with less ties to the mainline carrier.
1850,"Flew ""Rouge"" from Barbados April 18th absolutely worst flight we have had. We usually fly Air Canada but we will never fly Rouge again-you are cramped in like sardines no entertainment system - unless you bring your own laptop/tablet - word to Air Canada - this is not acceptable."
1851,We have returned from a holiday in Barbados. We flew comfortably to Barbados as usual on Air Canada. To our surprise we were flown home on Rouge. It is a very uncomfortable plane for this long flight. Cramped seats which are very uncomfortable. There is a ten dollar fee for the IPad entertainment system. The plane and service was chintzy at best. Service staff tried to be cool. We are dedicated Air Canada travellers and this was not up to the standard we have come to expect.
1852,"We were very satisfied with AF's premium economy (note: this review is for AF's old Premium Economy, not for the new one which is currently installed). After the no-frills flight from TXL to CDG and a stop-over stay in Paris, we boarded the B777 through the SkyPriority gate (which we also were able to use at check-in and security) and found the seats to be quite good: fixed shell (very rare in Premium Economy) and ample legroom, Sennheiser noise cancelling headphones, a decent IFE screensufficient storage space. As others mentioned before, there is no real decline and the seat cushions were worn out which led us to use the cushions handed out to make sitting a little bit more comfortable. Good quality amenity kits were handed out. Food and drinks: after champagne for aperitif, designated Premium Economy menu cards were handed out. We were served the main cabin economy lunch, but on a different tray. The food was among the best we have had in economy both quality and quantity wise. It was accompanied by wine which was presented restaurant style in a real glass. Digestifs were followed by a cornet filled with sweets. Before landing, a yummy pizza pocket was served. Fight attendants were always approachable, friendly and courteous. We would book AF's premium economy again whenever possible, especially because of the fixed shell seat and great food."
1853,"Flew on AF6 on June 11, return AF7 June 14. On the way to New York, flight delayed 2 hrs. The plane in fact left on time but before taking off, we went back to the gate for an engine problem. We stayed in the plane with very low explanations. Flight was smooth, FA nice. Food ok, not great at all, and the sandwich before landing disgusting. Good video choice. Upon arrival in JFK we had to wait 30 mn before disembarking. Return flight AF7. Easy check in, boarding was postponed 30 min apparently because the cabin was not ready yet. After thirty min we were told that it was a technical problem, and again an engine problem. We board with two hours delay and as we wee ready to go we were the 30th for take off, another hour delay so arrived 3 hrs after scheduled time. Food was very bad, breakfast impossible to eat and the cabin was very cold. Never again in coach on the A380."
1854,"My wife and I were on AF72 yesterday from Paris to LAX and we were in Business Class.  We noticed a large downgrade in service from a similar flight we had about 4 years ago. What surprised us the most was the very average service in flight, such as not picking up meal plates, refilling our beverages and the like.  It also
seemed like we were supposed to take our trays back, go pick up our beverage at the cart and fend for ourselves. The meals were not much better.  The salmon I was served was well done and I still don't know what the ""side"" was. My observation is that we were not the only ones who raised their eyebrows to a fairly disappointing Business Class experience. True be told, it reminded us of what traveling in coach was 12 years ago."
1855,Travelled from Gatwick to Havana via Madrid. No delays. Checked in online both ways and managed to get 2 seats together an aisle and a window both ways. Take your own inflight entertainment as it is almost non existent a small screen hardly visible with Spanish movies. The food is almost in edible so we took our own. You can get water anytime by walking up to the cabin rooms. A cheap alternative to the Virgin flight which is almost impossible to obtain in the school holidays unless you book a year in advance. It is also aboutÂ£Â£300 more each! Boarding was much quicker and the 2x4x2 seating makes it quite pleasant as the only person you have to disturb is your partner.
1856,BRU-MAD-BRU - first time I have used Air Europa and I was impressed. Nice Embraer 195 aircraft on this route (2x2) both flights on time professional crew (far better than Iberia) easy and clear online booking procedure including free bag seat selection/change free no charge if you don't print the boarding card yourself. Overall a good experience and no hesitation to use them again for short haul flights in Europe.
1857,I fly very often (1 round trip/month) VGO-MAD-ORY. I am very satisfied with the service offered. VGO-MAD always on quite new E195 with good legroom MAD-ORY with E195 or B737 in very good shape. On the first flights of the day you get free newspapers. Very good telephone customer service. I do not know about the quality of food as I never pay for it on the flight. I'd definitely recommend flying Air Europa in short-medium haul flights.
1858,Flew Ottawa-Toronto-Cancun-Toronto-Ottawa. All flights were late. On the way from Toronto to Cancun the boarding was late and we waited almost an hour on the tax way on the way back the flight was more than 2 hours late we lost the connection for Ottawa. They put us on standby for a flight 4 hours later without knowing if we could continue the same day. Finally it took us 19 hours to come back from Cancun to Ottawa and on top of it they sent one of our pieces of luggage to Newfoundland. We paid for seat reservations and did not get our seats. There was garbage from previous passengers on the floor. There was no wifi onboard and neither TV screens for such a long distance flight. Staff onboard were correct. Staff on the ground were very unpleasant and unhelpful. It will be our last trip with Air Canada.
1859,"I took an Air Canada Rouge recently from San Diego to Toronto on an A319 and it was the most uncomfortable flight I have taken in years. The seats themselves are not comfortable. I am 6'3"" and I physically could not place my knees in front of me and spent the flight trying to avoid being kneecapped by the attendant's carts. The woman in the seat behind my wife had her knees embedded into the back of my wife's seat and she was a lot shorter than 6'. There is no entertainment system other than the wifi - not even audio. I had a Blackberry Playbook with me and my wife had a Google Nexus but neither one could log into the ""Air Canada App"". No wonder Blackberry is in trouble when the national carrier couldn't be bothered to make their app compatible. I will do what I have to to avoid future flights on Rouge. I booked on Air Canada and was not aware that they placed me on a Rouge flight."
1860,AC Rouge to Las Vegas. Horrible experience: no leg room no entertainment system except if using own entertainment device (mobile tablet or laptop). However the seats are lacking any power outlet and have no USB ports preventing charging. There is no way to make a laptop last the whole flight. Moreover mobile and laptop requires to have previously installed the Air Canada Rouge app which of course was not installed on my own devices.
1861,Me and my wife flew up from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq and back again. The food was perfect. The seats where okay but you couldn't lower it to a bed. There was no AVOD system but the pre selected movies were great directly from the cinema.
1862,I flew to Kangerlussuaq (A330) a couple days later to Nuuk (Dash7) then Ilulissat- Kangerlussuaq-Copenhagen (Dash7 + A330). The flights were pleasant on time and meals onboard were delicious Greenlandic products (fish shrimp). Considering Air Greenland has more or less a monopoly on travel to/in Greenland the service was excellent. On the Kangerlussuaq-Nuuk leg we turned back 3 minutes before landing in Nuuk due to sudden fog upon landing in Kangerlussuaq we were given lunch vouchers worth 100 DKK and clear information on when we could attempt to fly again. Visitors must keep in mind that weather is very erratic and unpredicatable in Greenland so you need to factor possible delays not under the control of the airline. The safety card in the seat pocket had interesting information on how to use the seat upholstery to keep your feet warm in case of an emergency landing in arctic weather most unusual !
1863,"Copenhagen - SÃ¸nderstrÃ¸mfjord - Asiaat and return. Airbus A330-200 very comfortable. Everyone on economy had their own 7"" LCD Screen variety of film rather poor. The food was excellent! The DASH7 to Asiaat was rather cramped and noisy and we only got two cookies and a glass of juice / Coffee. But what can you expect for a 45 min flight?"
1864,I recently traveled with Air France from Miami to Paris and Paris to Miami on a Boeing 777-300ER. I purchased the tickets 4 months ahead of time and upgraded for more legroom. On both flights Air France change our seating and I was not able to get a refund for the upgrade. In addition I had order seats so that I could actually sit next to my wife. It would have been nice to sit next to her for the 9 hour flight. Just because you pick the seating and pay for it does not mean you actually get what you pay for. Beware. I have traveled several times to Paris and this was my first and last time using Air France. There are better options and I will be going back to the other airline that I have used in the past
1865,"Paris - Singapore with the new First Class Cabin. In Paris, wonderful ground service (escort, lounge to die for, escort to the plane), but it is something different on board. The new suites are beautiful but many details are boring (curtain, lighting, no aircon behind the curtain). The plane was 3 hours delayed. The crew in First Class were not trained and qualifed for First. Staff did their best and were friendly but service was more J than F. Due to late departure, they had a problem with catering, many items for the dinner were missing. The food we had was superb, however too many things were missing. Desserts were frozen: impossible to eat. Ground service in Singapore was more than perfect. Air France La PremiÃ¨re is wonderful on the ground but in the plane. Very disappointing, especially if you listen their marketing."
1866,Flew from BRU to BUE via MAD and was quite satisfied. Pretty cheap tickets but found the flight enjoyable. Seats are comfy with good recline legroom ok and flight entertainment is good many movies. Quality of the food should be reviewed.
1867,Flew LGW-MAD-CSS and back several times and - given the circumstances - AE did their best to get me from A to B. They allowed extra baggage (inexpensive rates paid prior) on top of a generous promotional allowance they provided overnight accommodation in Madrid when then London leg got cancelled and later re-booked fine Spanish wine (though this gets curtailed). True not the best food but it matches the price the worst uniforms in the world and their (lack of) sleeping arrangements (very 80s) only support this. I imagine the poor service is due to a lack of feeling international.
1868,Sao Paulo - Madrid early January. Late night flight was delayed by almost one hour because of how chaotic that airport can get at night with so many long haul flights leaving at the same time. When on board only very cheap orange juice was offered as a drink. Staff were pretty careless in general I would even say the male attendants looked slightly scruffy. Before take off they were just giggling and eating at the front of the plane. Meal service was rushed and not even menus were handled in stead chicken or pasta were offered. IFE was slow difficult to understand and very poor in general. What really shocked me about this flight is when I woke up after sleeping a few hours is finding half of the crew sleeping in the empty business class seats! I've always seen a few reserved ones for the pilots but I never expected seen so many! On the other hand very comfortable seat and I managed to arrive to Madrid all fresh but the quality of the inflight service was bad possibly the worst crew I've ever had.
1869,"AC Rouge 0818 to Puerto Vallarta Mexico and back with 0819 both flights simply horrible. No leg room bare bones no frills nothing. Very unsympathetic staff. Overall a very uncomfortable flight. I booked one year ago and it was an AC flight and was downgraded to Rouge. As a senior with artificial limbs I was extremely restricted soft seats no pillows or any options unless one paid an additional prohibitive sum of close to $1000 for a ""Premier Rouge"" seat. Although I am an Aerogold member I will no longer by loyal to Air Canada."
1870,First and last time flying Air Canada Rouge. YYZ to MCO with 3 kids and no movies. Did not want to fork over another $30 for something that is available with other carriers.
1871,Just flew YYZ to SJO - my first flight with rouge. Seats are horrible no leg room very uncomfortable flight. Inexperienced staff did not help. Didn't have an ipad to watch the entertainment but they announced that they were having problems with it and were working on it. This was almost a 5 hour flight - seats are way too uncomfortable. Possible fuel leak delayed us out - sat on the plane for nearly an hour before we left. Wouldn't you think they would check for a fuel leak before loading us all on?
1872,"On 5/21/2015 I flew from Miami to Paris to Budapest. Seated in 6A/6B, last row in business class, last to be served, 1.5 hrs before a beverage was served. Many flight attendants, poor crew coordination. Great service on the Paris to Budapest leg, a truly professional F/A. Returned from Amsterdam to Paris, uneventful, other than the Captain gave incorrect local time upon announcement prior to landing. Last leg Paris-Miami on 6/5/2015. Seated again last row, seats 6F/6G, in the middle a configuration of three, so a middle seat with no privacy. Last to be served. Poor quality food."
1873,"IAD-CDG, 2nd June. CDG-CAI, 4th June. Check in at Dulles Airport was excellent and fast through sky priority, the Business class Lounge at Dulles was overcrowded  but I had my space any way. Boarding was on time , but we stayed at the Airplane almost an hour not moving as the pilot says it was because of the traffic, so we end up with a delay of 75 min. Lots of people lost their connection in CDG. The flight was excellent, service was great with excellent food and beverage. The Videos were the same as KLM in MAY, as I flew to IAD by KL. The second flight from CDG to CAI has almost the same delay, with the same traffic reason. Service, and food were excellent,
comfortable seats and good music."
1874,"DEL-AMS-EDI. I haven't travelled with Air France for a while and was very disappointed with my experience on this flight. The food was truly awful for an eight hour journey. The first 'meal' consisted of a cereal bar, a small tub containing 3 pieces of fruit and a hot 'sandwich' which was revolting. The breakfast served before arrival in Paris was only a little better - a limp omelette with a couple of pieces of vegetable. The entertainment system kept freezing. I watched 2 movies but never saw the end of either them! Having spent the previous few weeks travelling on Asian carriers around Asia and India I was struck by how far European Airlines have fallen behind in customer service and in-flight catering. On the connecting service to Edinburgh I was offered a biscuit! On a flight of similar length in India I was offered a hot meal. To end on a positive note both flights were very punctual."
1875,ORY-MAD-BUE round trip. Nice staff cheap tickets but poor food and IFE on MAD-BUE. Inflight plan map already available on 90s for other airlines. Seats Ok but airplane needs to be revamped especially bathrooms. Hope new A330 will be better. ORY-MAD with an embraer and back with a new generation 737 800 definitely better.
1876,LGW - Madrid - Havana and return. The short haul aircraft was suitable for the length of flight but the long haul was pretty primitive! Old looking plane some bleached flickering unviewable screens dotted about for those that speak Spanish! The food was completely inedible! I'm not overly picky when it comes to airline food but outgoing was a rubbery pesto pasta with a sickly synthetic mousse type thing for pudding and coming back was a burnt chewy dollop of ground beef with hard rice! There was a little cake square that looked nice but unfortunately was dry as a bone! There was a lot of food wastage. Even the fruit juices taste like the cheapest juice money can buy. Flying direct with Virgin is more than worth the couple of hundred pounds extra to be honest! The Madrid to Gatwick leg was delayed due to a broken down aircraft plus offloading luggage of some no-shows so all in all that was our first and last connecting flight! Some of the staff on some of the planes were friendly but some very sharp!
1877,My family and I flew to Orlando from Toronto (AC 1862) on April 13. These flights are no cheaper than the regular Air Canada flights to Orlando (we usually go there twice a year) and to put up with the no leg room (I am a small female (5'4 and 120 pds) no service and a terrible entertainment system I would need these flights to cost $100 a ticket to put up with such a horrible flight. My husband (who is a super elite member) said that he will never take an Air Canada Rouge flight again.
1878,Horrible. Paid for business class from Toronto to Las Vegas on April 13 2014 - no leg room / awful food / no wi-fi.
1879,"Flew non stop Rouge Flt. 1880 Jan 16 Toronto-Sarasota and return on Rouge Flt 1881 Apr. 5. Both flights were conducted in an efficient and professional manner. The new Rouge outfits worn by the youthful and polite flight attendants were jaunty and fun. Cafe service was good. The Economy seats were comfortable. The pitch at 29"" is close but not something to obsess about. Hey the Rouge seat is wider at 18"" than an Air Transat Economy seat at 16.5"" I did not rent or bring an iPad on board so I cannot comment on the wi-fi entertainment offerings. The seasonal (winter) non stop Rouge service to Sarasota from Toronto is welcome and time saving as the rest of the year I have to make connections through Atlanta on Delta airlines or Charlotte on US Airways. Service on these airlines is also good but no better than Rouge. Rouge is a good airline & I wish it great success."
1880,Flew 1851/1852 three times from Toronto to Vegas in March/April 2014. I thought Rouge was supposed to be a discount carrier but all 3 flights were over 1000 bucks. The seating is absolutely horrible - the worst I have seen in years and I have been a super elite traveler for the past 3 years. Wifi entertainment is extremely buggy on my iPad. Half the shows stop playing part way through and you can't even select individual songs from an album when listening to music - It always defaults to the first song in that album. The worst part about this whole experience is that not one time over the last 3 trips was the plane on schedule. The 2nd trip coming back to Toronto on the redeye flight was eventually cancelled at 3am keeping everyone waiting around the airport when it was known that the plane's broken windshield would not have been fixed that night. The next day was a nightmare the noon flight was delayed by 4hrs and they just couldn't manage the people waiting around very well. Put them on the next United flight out! But of course that means taking responsibility and taking care of the passengers something that Rouge and Air Canada seem incapable of doing lately. I have to say that the staff were friendly. I have been a loyal and frequent traveler with Air Canada for the past 9 years and I have to say that this is it for me. WestJet is in order of magnitudes better than Air Canada for their domestic coverage including US and I'm just hoping that they will bury this Rouge airline quick.
1881,I chose Air France to fly from Edinburgh to Florence through CDG. Out tickets were purchased as through tickets and I noticed that they only provided for a 50 minute connection from the AF Hop regional hub which is at the far end of the airport and only accessible by bus through immigration and on to pier E. I emailed twice to seek confirmation that this could be done and was assured on both occasions that it could. Suffice to say it cannot and our connection was missed by 20 minutes (even our case couldn't make it). This is when you fully experience the sharp end of AF's customer service staff who consider you to be something on the bottom of their shoe. We were put on the flight some 3 hrs later sitting at opposite ends of the aircraft despite me telling them my wife was a nervous flyer. During our deliberations at the desk business class went from being full to (upon further pressing) empty and being held so on the rather unlikely event of 8 people turning up half an hour before the flight and buying business class tickets. I didn't want to fly business class but simply suggested that a couple of other passengers could be upgraded freeing up two seats together for my wife and myself. I asked to speak to a manager - none were available. I was told that I was only an economy passenger and that to get anything better I would have to purchase two business class single fares amounting to almost 1000 Euros. Suffice to say when the flight took off there were 6 empty business class seats whilst I was in row 6 and my wife rather uncomfortably in row 24. We could have flown directly with Ryanair to Pisa but I prefer to fly the Flag Carrier experience for a quality of service that was sadly lacking with Air France. Next year I will be flying through Schipol with KLM.
1882,Flew from Paris to Havana and return in Premium Economy. Very pleasantly surprised. The priority check in boarding etc worked perfectly in both directions. Very comfortable seats excellent food and drinks and in both directions and great service by the crew. Flights in both directions were on time. Well worth the extra price compared with premium economy in other airlines. No shortage of drinks during flight including Champagne and ample legroom in the shell seats.
1883,I flew AF254 CDG-SIN in May and had the opportunity to try out their new Business Class on the 777-300. The new seat is fantastic and offers a great level of privacy. In-flight entertainment offered a huge selection of movies and TV shows. Food and beverage was excellent and the service was too. the whole experience was premium and cant fault AF at all.
1884,"Paris - Panama Boeing 777-200. The business product is really what we can expect. For the majority of passengers they still have to fly in a cabin totally obsolete versus competition. The 2x3x2 configuration is not acceptable anymore for an 11 hour flight. The seat is uncomfortable. The ICE screen is smaller and lower quality than most of the economy seats on the competition. The ICE is very limited. The food is nothing to see. Bad quality ""foie gras"" insipid main courses. The choice of wine is limited to 4 but one of the four is not available on board. The staff were good but a little bit too familiar and relaxed. Air France promotional images are not reflected on board. Really behind competition."
1885,Travelled to Cuba from Gatwick via Madrid December 2013 return Jan 2014. Seats reserved in advance via the charged service on website. Outward journey seats as booked return journey seat booked had already been allocated supervisor unable to change them we had queued for 2 hours at Havana airport because there were only two desks open. Inflight staff were generally unhelpful food was awful.
1886,We had Air France tickets from Malaga to JFK and back from MEX connecting flights to/from Paris with Air Europa. Air Europa does not provide 24-hour online check-in. We arrived 80 minutes prior to departure at check-in in Malaga to find a huge queue that moved very slowly. 3 check-in staff only ours was rather unpleasant and grumpy. With 20 minutes to go for departure we were running to security leaving behind about 30 more passengers waiting to be checked-in. Arrived at the gate to be told to rush onto the plane. Onboard the most uncomfortable airline seat old and worn and hardly reclineable. They are also too short so half your thighs don't fit the seat and it inclines downwards so one has the unpleasant feeling of sliding off! Despite the delay we made our connection in Paris. On the return we checked-in online via Aeromexico (still all on AF tickets) but the Air Europa connection Paris-Malaga did not yield seat assignments nor boarding passes. At check-in in MEX we were told they could not help us because when you check-in online this apparently messes up the boarding pass/seating process on Air Europa. Once in Paris AF staff at the connection counter finally printed boarding passes for Air Europe. Yet again the seats were very uncomfortable and old and barely acceptable for a 2-hour flight. Staff just like on the outbound were very indifferent. If at all possible I would avoid Air Europa in the future. I can handle unpleasant staff but I would avoid them purely because of the discomfort of the seats on their B737 that seem to be at least 20 years old.
1887,I travelled YYZ-SAN on April 1. The restrictive seat pitch on Air Canada Rouge A-319 is intolerable for a flight exceeding 5.5 hours. The operation of the flight was problematic. No reason or apology was offered for our 25-minute late arrival in San Diego. If it was due to adverse weather en route this must have been known to the flight crew prior to our departure from YYZ and appropriate measures taken. The flight was fully boarded and doors closed 10 minutes before scheduled departure time (6.05pm). Nonetheless the aircraft was held at the gate until 6.05pm and then started a lengthy taxi to the runway where it was delayed again to await two general aviation arrivals. For sheer professionalism I will travel by United next time.
1888,I flew 1851 YYZ-LAS and 1852 LAS-YYZ recently and will never do it again! Old run down planes inexperienced flight attendants garbage in-flight entertainment system cramped seats and absolutely no legroom and I am of average height and weight. I fly this route fairly regularly and won't be flying Rouge again. It will be WestJet from now on or connections with United. Air Canada - putting Rouge on this route (as well as many others) was a very poor decision on your part and one that I hope you will re-visit. Until you do you've lost me as a customer.
1889,Flew to Las Vegas over past weekend. Whole experience was beyond bad. Worst seating I have ever experienced. iPad did not work on inbound or outbound flights. Both flights gate attendants said at least 25 people had to check carry on bags did Air Canada not think or care that by cramming all those extra seats in the plane this might be an issue part of this issue of course is that that a checked for my wife and I adds another 100 dollars to the flight. I will never fly with them again will pay more for better airline.
1890,CDG-BOG. If you want to travel as it was in 2000's choose Air France in economy class A340. The cabin has more than ten years IFE screen is smaller than a hand very poor definition flight attendants do strict minimum not a very agreeable flight. If you need to fly to Bogota from Europe I'd prefer to fly with Avianca Lufthansa Iberia or American!
1891,I took a flight from Paris to Tokyo Narita on 777-300. Usually I took this route on economy or premier economy but this time I upgraded myself using mileage So my expectation was high. But it was very disappointing to see the quality of food and wine as well as maintenance of business class seats. Foods were not interesting and wine was simply cheap. I do not expect much in air but I did not feel that I was entertained. Seat was not functioning well and entertainment was extremely limited. It seems that AF lost interest in attracting good customers on this route. I would suggest staying in economy or taking another carrier's business class such as JAL or ANA.
1892,Air France AF681 on March 23 2015 from Atlanta to Paris was extremely harsh on me while I was traveling alone with my 13-month old son. They took away the stroller before I entered the flight and promised to give me a replacement at Paris. They gave no reason why my own stroller would not be given back to me and will directly be sent to New Delhi - my final destination. I had bought this stroller specifically as per Air France requirements/size limit. In Paris CDG airport they initially said they will give me a stroller at baggage claim (that makes no sense as I was not collecting my baggage). Then they said it will be given after I walk down to the next entry point. Finally they said they will give it at the boarding and I said that I will not need it at that moment. Carrying my son in one hand I had to manage my backpack and two more pieces of carry on baggage and had to take numerous stops before I reached the next flight. Not to mention I had to go through the security check too. Had my parents not met me in Paris CDG airport mid-way to join me on the next flight I would have missed the connecting flight that I had to catch within about an hour. Even in AF681 flight there were no attendants to help me to even mix the formula milk for my son and my co-passenger helped me. Website mentions about kid's meal that I had ordered beforehand only to find out that this will not suit my baby. I had to order baby meal (which is basically milk) but no one mentioned that when I pre-ordered meals over the phone before my travel.
1893,I flew LON-MAD MAD-LON in Air Europa's so called business class which is described on their website as 'we make you feel special'. The reason I took this airline is that the scheduled times were the best for me but in future I will certainly not fly with them except in economy if I must. The flight was an hour late departing from Lon but no announcement was made until it was already more than 30 minutes late. The flight to Madrid had the newer seats which were comfortable but that is where the business service ends. The flight crew (minus the purser) were rude and uninterested in their business customers I had to ask 3 times for a bottle of water when I asked if they had English language newspapers I was asked 'por que?' (possibly because the flight is from London?) and the food was sub-standard wrapped in cling film and plonked down on plastic. When I asked for wine she simply banged one down and walked away swishing the curtain behind her. The return flight was also sub-par with two slices of cheese and two leathery pieces of chicken constituting breakfast. Such a disappointment it would have been better to save the extra 300 euros and bought food in economy.
1894,March 29 - April 2 2014 Toronto to Las Vegas it was one of the worst experience that I have had flying the leg room is terrible no entertainment and no adjustable air flow it gets very warm inside the plane also the staff were not very friendly I am glad that I didn't upgrade to business class because that was not much better. I fly to Las Vegas and Los Angeles on business several times a year and would hope that Air Canada would at least give me a choice to fly Rouge or Air Canada. I will be looking to fly with another carrier this is taking Air Canada back 30 years. I have been a super elite member for several years and try to fly Air Canada as often as possible. I hope this venture for Air Canada will eventually fail.
1895,I flew business class on Air Canada Rouge on 2nd April back from Las Vegas and this was my first time flying with Rouge. I am baffled that Air Canada has their name associated with Rouge. Not impressed at all. No TVs and the ipads that were provided worked for about 15 minutes until they had technical difficulties. The seats are not as comfortable as a regular Air Canada flight.
1896,"Flight 1873 Montreal-Orlando. March 28th departure April 4th return. Not worthy of Air Canada! Huge disappointment! Seats were extremely tight and I'm 5""3. My partner is 6""2 and were miserable. Air Canada Rouge is extremely cheap! No entertainment food claustrophobic! Choose other airline!"
1897,Premium Economy (PE) CDG-Beijing-CDG return. B777-200ER outbound B777-300ER return. PE seat is wider (9 across compared to 10 in economy) but has barely any recline and is very uncomfortable for a long distance flight. Food service was truly awful: the food is standard economy fare OK but the actual quality amount taste and presentation of the food (whether Western or Chinese menu) is terrible. Staff service was marked by its absence. Drinks very limited. Video system old does not work well and not much choice. Climate control in cabin poor the flights became hot and stuffy. Cabin dirty. In short while presented and priced as a premium product Premium Economy on these flights with Air France was substandard in practically every respect.
1898,The equipment was old. The screens were small. The food was so-so. Staff were extremely helpful and made the whole flight a very pleasant experience. I flew with Air France with my wife and son last month from India to USA. The crew of the airlines the people at the check-in counter the flight staff security at Paris were extremely helpful. What could have been a stressful travel with an 8 month old turned into a pleasant trip. 11/10 rating for the Air France staff.
1899,I took an intercontinental return flight from Madrid to Havana. It was a daytime flight and except from the comfort of the seat this was an incredibly bad experience. The service was by far the worst service I've had in an airplane. The crew were very unfriendly and not co-operative at all. With dinner you'll get 1 drink. Apart from water or orange juice you have to buy all other drinks. The crew started serving food at a slow pace afterwards they came 3 times with coffee/tea and immediately afterwards the whole crew started to have dinner themselves. The stewards/stewardesses also didn't respond at all to the service lights you can switch on at you seat. I don't expect much from airplane food but this was one of the worst I've had. Air Europa also doesn't provide a personal entertainment system. It is still done by some general screens from the ceiling and was only broadcasting a movie in Spanish. Worst of all the movie was restarted 3 times and wasn't finished in the end. On the return way we had to wait an 1.5 hrs to get checked in. There was an enormous queue all the way through the departure hall. About half of the passengers still had to check in after us. So we asked for window seats (25% of the seats). We were told these weren't available anymore. So we asked for Aisle seats (50% of the seats). The ground stewardess told us she would fix this. In the end from the 10 people we were traveling with only 1 had an aisle seat and the rest were scattered through the whole plane on centre seats. Luckily this was a night flight and we were all tired. So we slept most of the way and didnt have to deal with the service or Spanish movie. The food was of the same standard again: really bad.
1900,I must say that I was hesitant to take Air Europa after the reviews but found the experience to be really good. Granted our luggage went missing connecting in Madrid to Lisbon but the inbound flight was operated by Delta so who knows where the blame lies and I strongly suspect Delta. Service was good food much better than expected and flights on time. Cabin was comfortable. Someone's putting effort in here.
1901,We travelled by Air Europa on 19th December to Cuba and returned 28th December - or started our return then! Both the outward and inward flights were delayed by around 3 hours both for different reasons. The delay of the return flight to Madrid was handled very badly by the airline. Even though the airline knew we were delayed and connecting flights were missed no arrangements were made to cater for this even though they had 8 hours to prepare! It took an extra 2 hours at the airport to get onward flights arranged for the following day after queuing multiple times and being sent to two separate terminals. They were woefully understaffed. The inflight entertainment didn't work on the return flight the sound was not being transmitted. There were only several large screen available which made the visibility of the screens fairly poor. The plane was fairly antiquated communication was very poor on why we were delayed on both flights. The stewardess's were miserable. I would not use this airline again.
1902,Montreal to Vegas on direct flight on A319. Simply put the legroom is beyond bad I am of average height when the person in front of me put back their seat it was hitting against my knees. To have to endure this for a 5.5 hour flight is a terrible experience. Flying back from Vegas on a 767 through Toronto and switched to an A320 which was not a rouge plane almost felt I was in 1st class. As far as the 767 plane no climate control constant draught. Overall a terrible experience. Out of curiosity found it was cheaper by about $200 to use another airline. Never will I fly on Rouge again unless they resolve the seating issue.
1903,AC1852 3 April AC1851 6 April. Just got off the second leg of Vegas - Toronto and back. The seats were small with no legroom there was no closet and nowhere in business class for a business sized carry on. Very frustrating.
1904,Flew AC rouge to CUN from Toronto in the J cabin. The service was acceptable the food was the same as mainline however the comfort in the redesigned A319 left a lot to be desired. Seats were very uncomfortable seat pitch in business class was significantly less than on mainline. The IFE was beyond terrible.
1905,AC 1880 and 1881 return from Toronto to Sarasota this past winter. We had the bad luck of being on a Rouge flight. I have one word to describe the experience. Awful. This old refurbished equipment which seems to have a lot of mechanical problems. The seats are extremely uncomfortable. There is minimal leg room even if you pay extra for the seats with supposed extra space. AC advertises this Rouge flight as a more economical flight. The only thing economical about it is the interior. We paid exactly the same as we have paid in all the other years we have gone to Sarasota. Business Class is a total joke. On our trip back to Toronto we only found out that the flight was delayed when we got to the airport. Flight Tracker gave no indication of this delay neither did the AC website. It would have been nice to have been notified of this delay by phone email or text thus saving us having to spend an excruciating amount of time at the Sarasota airport. Having tracked the arrival and departure times of these flights over the past several weeks of this winter it seems that the norm has been at least a 1 hour delay. The weather was not always a factor. AC has to improve this. We have choices as to how we get to Sarasota. It is for certain that we will not ever fly on a Rouge flight again.
1906,AF6 CDG-JFK on Airbus 380. Easy check-in at CDG but chaotic boarding because the escalator was out of order. Very professional staff very good food great choice of movies not only US blockbusters. The airbus 380 does not offer yet the new cabin but it was ok. Delivery luggage in JFK was a nightmare we had to wait for our suitcases despite priority tags.
1907,Economy Premium from Nuremberg NUE to Paris CDG operated by HOP Regional Feeder to long haul flight small Embraer plane limited space and legroom but ok for 1 hour. Small breakfast (grilled vegetables on baked roll) and 1 drinks service. Nothing special.
1908,Premium Economy from Paris CDG to Nuremberg NUE operated by HOP Regional Feeder from long haul flight small Embraer plane limited space and legroom but ok for 1 hour. Small breakfast (croissant for me 2 croissants) and 1 drinks service wanted orange juice which was available for the business seat in front of me but was told by the flight attendant it was not available - ridiculous. Nothing special.
1909,Madrid to Sao Paulo last week. Airplane wasn't very new or clean and as we found out later on during the flight it had just come back from doing another route less than two hours before. Purser and flight attendants were extremely good and nothing was too much trouble they kept offering food and drink throughout the flight. Quality of the catering was average. No IFE during the flight so we were handed some iPads instead not many movies but plenty of games etc. Overall and considering how much more expensive the other tickets were with other airlines I can say I was fairly satisfied with the flight hard working cabin crew doing their best with probably not the best tools around.
1910,Dec 7th flight from Montevideo Uruguay to Madrid Spain (12 hour flight): I was very concerned when I read reviews after purchasing my ticket. However I must admit the boarding process was efficient the plane was very clean and my vegetarian meals were above average in terms of airline food. The gate personnel and flight crew were very attentive and courteous. After a pleasant trip I reminded myself that a good review was in order given all the negative reviews I had read. Yes I would recommend this airlines and hope to fly them again in the near future.
1911,I can't say I was impressed especially on the long haul sector. I recently did a London - Madrid - Havana de Cuba. The flight from London to Madrid was pleasant and aircraft was very new. For a regional flight it was very well equipped and decent selections for food purchase. Transit in Madrid was easy enough despite Madrid not being the most organized airport. The long haul flight to Havana was a different story. The staff do not seem to be well co-ordinated for boarding at all which means it was really slow as people were not directed properly. The aircraft was quite dated and my fear was confirmed that there was no individual TV. That was fine but my luck meant that my headset point didn't work (both times going out and return flight). Flight was full so not a lot of options there but force myself to try sleeping. Meals were average but the massive gap between meals were crazy! If they missed you because you were sleeping they won't come back to you even if they are still serving others further down the aisles. Overall can't say I recommend it.
1912,"Booked a flight from LAS-YYZ on Air Canada's website and was forced to take AC""s new low cost carrier Rouge. The plane was an extremely old 767 and besides the refurbished carpet and seats everything inside was old and run- down. The overhead compartment are probably from the 1990s as I forgot the last time I saw limited luggage space like that. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable with no entertainment whatsoever (there is the option to rent an iPad for a fee). The flight was a red-eye of around 5hrs but half the time the cabin lights were on as the crew came around trying to sell food. This was very disruptive to rest and added to the general discomfort of the flight experience. The crew were young and ""hip"" looking and I must say they were friendly. However they seemed inexperienced and newly hired. There was a passenger who lay on her seat and stretched her legs into the aisle throughout the flight. This was during take off and landing and none of the crew said anything about having the arm rest down or the fact that her legs were obstructing the aisle. I am sure this violates various national and international safety regulations and the crew did not seem to mind. Probably one of the worst flying experiences I have had and I would definitely not recommend flying with Rouge."
1913,Toronto to Las Vegas Flight 1851 March 27. Air Canada Rouge is simply horrible. The seats are so tight with no legroom. No inflight entertainment and FA's are not friendly at all. I didn't feel welcome or appreciated. The plane was dirty as it was not properly cleaned from the previous flight.
1914,"Air Canada Rogue is one of the worst if not the worst airline I have flown. I fly at least once a month. I booked my flights with Air Canada but the flights were changed to Rogue without notification. The seats are too small and very uncomfortable. My husband is 6'2"" and he was uncomfortable the whole flight. My elderly mother was almost in tears due to the lack of leg room. There is no entertainment systems. The last flight had only some breakfast items on an evening flight. All passengers were complaining about the lack of leg room. It is torture if the person ahead puts their seat back. I have always been a loyal Air Canada customer but I will be booking WestJet were possible. The flights were so bad I would rather have to change planes than endure another Rogue direct flight."
1915,BLQ-CDG and return. Very quick flight great check-in both way and helpful desk. Both flights were on time operated with A319 not really tidy and clean. The unbelievable things on these flights has been the cabin crews - awful! Impolite unavailable they just seemed to talk to each other no smile nothing. Don't know if I will fly AF again.
1916,KIX-CDG-OSL in March first leg with 777-200 second operated by HOP! with an Embraer 190. At Osaka Kansai Airport Air France operates at the southern part of the terminal which means a short train ride from the main hall. I arrived about one hour earlier than I really needed to so I had lot of time to spend in the deserted South terminal which really doesn't have many shops or dining areas. This hasn't anything to do with the airline though. But anyway - boarding went smoothly and fast maybe because most of the PAX were Japanese but more likely because very few PAX. The seats of Air France's old cabin at first look looks quite comfortable and nice but really they isn't. They're too hard and worn for a 12 hour flight. TV-screens were also quite worn and the IFE system even worse. Luckily Air France provides a generous amenity kit even in their economy class with noise- cancelling ear plugs low quality headphones sleeping mask and a wet-wipe which they are handing out shortly after takeoff. Food quality is average. We got a choice of two dinners a Japanese (a sesame beef I believe) or a Western as well as breakfast. Catering was extremely poor during the 12 hour long flight they only came serving us beverage two times. And by the way cabin crew wasn't really nice either. They seemed stressed and tired. The captain on the other hand made an announcement every time arriving over new areas which was nice. Second leg was an average short haul-flight with beverage and a sandwich. Nothing special.
1917,AF548 30 April 2015. Very poor economy seats on both the Airbus A340 and A330 practically no space left when the passenger in front reclines his or her seat completely. The entertainment screens are old with poor visibility certainly if the seat in front is fully reclined. Average quality of food. Quite friendly cabin staff on our last flight. In summary: the most expensive ticket on the Paris - Niamey route but overall a below average product.
1918,AMS - Madrid - Havana and return flight. Good new planes. Enough space. Crew not very helpful and friendly. Return flight was better than the flight to Havana. The food was really terrible no taste and disgusting. I will not book them again.
1919,I took a business class return flight from Amsterdam via Madrid to Lima Peru. The first leg from AMS to MAD was done with a smaller embraer aircraft. The leg space between the business class seats were the same as for economy which is not acceptable as I am mainly paying the higher price to have the comfort on board. The AMS business lounge was fine and ground service too. Arriving in Madrid I had 3 hours in the business lounge in Madrid. The difference was big. Mostly pre-packed food (sandwiches) in the fridge no choice of warm food. It was quite busy there and after a while all tables were littered with the plastic packaging. Nobody seemed to be responsible for cleaning it up. It looked very messy. This is definitely not how I would like to travel when I pay business class. With 1.5hr delay we took off for Lima. There was almost no equipment on board which you would expect in a business class. No entertainment in the seats no flight deck information channel. Instead we got an apple IPad with some films on it. Flight information (like distance ETA speed etc) was only available on three fixed screens in the cabin if there were no adds or other films. English newspapers: nothing! All overhead lockers were covered with oily finger/handprints from the mechanics. The excuse was that due to the delay they had no time for a proper hand over and cleaning check. The service itself was very good. All ladies were very engaged did their very best and tried to cope best possible with the lousy hardware. They told me that they have addressed the lack of English newspapers and some other issues many time to the management but obviously they management is resistant to improvements. The return flight was the same just that there were no fingerprints any more. So they found at least time for a proper cleaning. The business lounge in Lima was even worse when it came to service and food offering. I don't know why they can get away with this kind of service in South America and Spain. I hope that this will not be the future business class standard around the world.
1920,March 7 and 23 YYZ to SJO return AC1806/1806. I will never use Air Canada Rouge again. The 29-inch seat pitch is the lowest in North America with the exception of Spirit Airlines. This was the most uncomfortable flight I have taken. The barely edible food cost extra and most selections were sold out by the time the attendants reached my row. The in-flight entertainment system (which can only be played over one's own tablet or device) consistently malfunctioned. The plane was generally dirty and contained significant garbage left on earlier flights. A horrible experience.
1921,As a 4 times a year traveller to the Caribbean it is clear that ACR want to take every single penny of us the all inclusive prices are the same of AC. A flight is a flight the flight attendants are rude and impolite. I bought a sandwich that perhaps was a left over from another flight because the expired date was for the same day.
1922,When I booked ticket (3 in total) to travel the end of June 2014 from Canada to Barcelona Spain I booked with Air Canada and wanted AC to be my carrier. However I know find out we will be travelling with Air Canada Rouge the company's low cost carrier. I also have found out there will be NO entertainment unless you go out and buy an Ipad and the seats are going to be smaller and tighter together. There are other cuts and this is totally unfair to me as an Air Canada customer. I did not get any rebate for flying with this low cost carrier - absolutely nothing. It is just tough luck for us. I like travelling with Air Canada with their experienced crews and the special benefits that go along with the overseas flights. I am not happy about this - I feel like we have been Rouged by Air Canada.
1923,Air France flight 333 April 19 from Boston to Paris CDG was cancelled due to mechanical difficulties at 8:.00 boarding for 8.45 flight. Over 400 passengers told to go retrieve luggage which had to come from cancelled flight and to get in line to rebook. Our group of 59 were given lodging at Chelsea Marriott and 3 meal vouchers. Fitted onto the same flight the next day. Actual flight delayed one hour to get a passenger on a stretcher on plane. One day of Paris hotel and tours missed. I will say that the Air France personnel kept us informed about the cancelled flight and offered glasses of water during the long wait. Returned flight 338 on April 27 from Paris to Boston also cancelled due to mechanical difficulties. Cancellation in Paris was very poorly handled. From moving our group to a more isolated area where many of us could sit on the floor to not providing an escort or transportation to the Ibis hotel which was close to a 2 mile walk because of poor directions and location of hotel to the limited staff at the hotel and restaurant which stopped serving early for both dinner and breakfast to being charged 385 euros for an oversized box which cost $100 on Aer Lingus to get it to Paris desk employees did not know English or refused to speak it etc. Food on flights was awful beverages were fine TV did not work for my son and on both trips we were sitting near screaming infants. On flight to Boston we also had a young child kicking the seat. My son was moved but the kicking actually moved the seat next to his where I was sitting.
1924,Flew Boston to Paris April 19th. Flight was cancelled so missed a day of my vacation and list two scheduled tours. Food was good. Return trip flight on April 27th was cancelled again. Paris to Boston. They kept the luggage so I had no personal items. The flight ran out of food so I had no dinner and my movie screen was broken along with many other customers. The flight attendants didn't do much for me. Barely got an apology. Won't fly Air France ever.
1925,April 3 SIN-CGK Business Class - Air France has a very convenient eCheck-in option whereby you can elect to check-in automatically 30-hours prior to your flight (i.e. no need to manually do it online or via an app) and your boarding pass is sent to you automatically. I used this service for a SIN to CGK flight and arrived at the airport 90 minutes before departure. As I made my way through Immigration I was told to return to the AF check-in counter as the Immigration officials do not accept eBoarding passes for AF flights. Although this was slightly annoying I went to the AF counter. It looked like AF check-in counters were closing as majority of staff were packed up and only 1 counter was still open with a few pax in line. I asked a member of staff where the business class line was as it was not clear and was told that I can check-in using the kiosk. I did just that and received a boarding pass on thermal paper. I once again made my way to Immigration and this time was told that I could not go through Immigration unless AF has verified my documents. I tried to protest but ended up returning to the AF check-in counter again. All the counters were closed and all staff were gone. This was now 55 minutes before departure. In a panic I asked a member of Changi Airport Information Desk team if they could help me. They kindly tracked down the AF office number but there was no answer. A family had arrived by this time with 2 young children in the same situation as me: holding an eBoarding pass but not able to get through Immigration. One of the Changi Airport staff kindly went through Immigration to the Departure lounge and to the gate to approach the AF staff directly. She reported back over the phone that AF may not be able to let me board. 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure a member of the AF ground staff slowly made their way back to the check-in counter and handed me a 'proper' boarding pass and asked me to run to the gate or miss the flight. As she was checking that my passport was in order she told the family of 4 that they could also run to the gate and try and make the flight but there was no way their luggage would be flying with them that day. Looking back at no point during the check-in process (a) the reminder email to check-in online (b) the online check-in or (c) when using the kiosk to check-in - at no point was there ever a mention that the eBoarding pass or the boarding pass on thermal paper was not enough to check-in for the flight. The member of staff who directed me to the kiosk did not mention this either. I was very lucky that the Changi Airport staff kindly helped me but I feel sorry for the family with 2 young kids who I know was denied boarding even though they - like me - followed all the steps required by AF regarding online check-in. This experience alone has taught me NOT to fly AF from Singapore Airport under any circumstances.
1926,"We had booked Air France Toronto to Malaga but the connecting flight Paris to Malaga was with Air Europa. Booked with Premium Economy the seats were uncomfortable. Just before landing I asked when our meal would be served the stewardess very rudely remarked that we were not entitled to a meal When I showed her our ticket she checked her list and there was our names with 'meal' beside it to which she stated 'Well you are sitting in the wrong seats'. We were in fact sitting exactly where we were supposed to according to our boarding pass which they checked on boarding. Thereupon she said ""Well it's too late now so what do you want to drink?"" I asked for a hot drink too late it had to be something cold. First and last for us with this airline!"
1927,London to Lima via Madrid and return. The outbound legs were ok. London to Madrid is the same standard as Easyjet or Ryanair (no frills). Their plane from Madrid to Lima was acceptable with seatback TVs but a poor selection of films. The food service was limited to a small meal and water. Any additional food had to be bought. Their plane from Lima to Madrid was terrible however. Reasonably comfortable but no individual entertainment. Just two movies and one TV show for a 12-hour flight. Staff were unpleasant and lied about services. Additional food and drinks were offered when the flight was delayed by 2.5 hours without a reason given. Our bags were not transferred to our connecting flight.
1928,We flew from Toronto to Cancun the last week of January and dreaded the return the next week. We booked Air Canada because the flight times were good we collect Aeroplan and fly AC from Toronto to Calgary at least once a year. We did not know anything about Rouge and not until almost the time for our flight did we know AC had another section for hot spots. We were not concerned because we have always been happy with our service. We did not know there was no in-flight entertainment until we were on the plane. We do not use Apple products but have an Android tablet no good to us on the flight. The seats are squishy and uncomfortable. The only saving grace coming home was I had booked late flights so we just slept no other choice. When we got to our destination I went on the web to learn about Rouge. It is not easy to find anything. Next time we will go to the States and choose an American carrier. Never again Rouge.
1929,"Flew Rouge ""business class"" from Toronto to Las Vegas and return a week ago. I had booked business class originally from Ottawa to Vancouver to Las Vegas but Air Canada cancelled that as the connection was too tight and instead routed me through Toronto. They promised me that business class would be exactly the same on Rouge but it is not! The seats are smaller there was no TV screen in backs of seats - they gave me a tablet to watch but the content was poor. Service was not good at all. And on top of all this the price was the same! Very disappointing."
1930,I flew with Air Canada Rouge in January on business from Toronto to Sarasota and was seated in the standard cabin. Although the flight itself was pleasant enough the seats were very close together and cramped. If given the choice I would not choose to fly with them again.
1931,Paris CDG to Singapore return in first class. There was a change in aircraft on the outbound flight and I did not experience the new cabin but staff were excellent and I was alone in the first class cabin. The first class lounge in Paris was fabulous with an exclusive ambience. I was disappointed that I could not enjoy the complimentary massage as the therapist was ill but the rest of the service was excellent. Escorted through security and immigration control with no stress and driven to the aircraft in a limousine from the lounge. Return flight from Singapore was in the new first class cabin a really luxurious cabin with only four seats. Again was greeted as soon as I arrived at the Jet quay terminal in Changi airport and all details taken care off without any hassle. I was driven to the departure gate in a buggy a lovely gesture indeed. Overall Air France certainly knows how to define first class service. I have flown first class long haul with three other airlines before and not one could match the service of La Premiere with Air France. If I wanted to be critical there are some minor details. Firstly the cost is much higher than most other airlines. Secondly there is no complimentary limousine service to and from the airport. Thirdly they may need to provide a more extensive menu to cater for people who are originally from the region in South East Asia.
1932,4/14/15 AF83 San Francisco to Paris return on 22nd. My first time flying outside of USA. Everything was well organized and the attendants were very nice. The food was good and the choices of movies TV etc was plenty to keep me entertained for hours.
1933,"We flew BOS-CDG. Then a week later CDG to Venice then return to Paris. I went home then my husband went home a week later same flight CDG-BOS. The BOS-CDG flight was typical cramped older plane. Surprisingly they offered us dinner. The last time I did this overnight flight there was not food just eye masks and lights out. The dinner and wine were good. The flight left late - not their fault. The Paris to Venice flights are less than two hours. cramped but okay. The CDG to BOS was on a 747. We always try to get the upper deck which doesn't feel like such a big plane. They booked me in the suppose last seat front row window but it turned out to be half empty and I was cramped with 3 across. The food is good staff are courteous. At least they label themselves as ""Safety"" and don't pretend to be your best friend. They're there for safety first after all. The in-flight entertainment selection was very good. The flight arrived on-time. The US customs area is a nightmare though."
1934,Business class round-trip JFK-MAD. The bad: their computer systems reservations and website are very deficient compared to other airlines. Not much information or interactive ability available on English Language website (examples: no seat maps no online check in or even online viewing of reservations). Disorganized: the reason I got to fly business on my return was because they lost my reservation (luckily I had my receipt) and I had paid for an exit row seat. The good which over rode the bad: they made things right with my reservations at the ticket counter and bumped me to business on my return flight. The agents on the phone were helpful and the service on the plane and at the counters was excellent and friendly (though not quite as organized as an American carrier). Good food nice planes (A330). Business seat headrests push your head forward though when in upright position which can be uncomfortable.
1935,"Flew Toronto-Puerto Vallarta-Toronto. Early both down and return! Great staff skewed younger and nice change from the stuffy regulars usually on AC! Service was great - purchased a wrap that was tasty! Entertainment - downloaded AC app and no problems both on my iPad and iPhone. Pitfall was not AC but the other passengers - one carry on means one not one plus a purse plus a backpack plus just ""two little bags of shopping"". Yes perhaps that is why you had no leg room your 5 carry on bags! There always has to be ""that one"" passenger and they always seem to sit near me! The seats are tight get over it you are on vacation - want a first class wide seat pay for one on a more expensive airline! Excellent service Rouge and can't wait to fly again!"
1936,We flew from San Jose Costa Rica to Toronto Canada on Air Canada Rouge. A lot of unusual activity at boarding with seat mix-ups people on the plane with boarding passes with no assigned seats and lots of passport checks. The flight was totally sold and left 1/2 hour late. Five hours into the flight and a half hour before landing we are told that 50 bags could not be loaded onto the plane because of jet fuel concerns due to high winds at San Jose late departure full capacity. We deplane clear immigration and hope that our bags have made it on the plane. We learn that there are no bags on the plane at all! No one at the airport claim desk or customs seems to think that this is anything unusual. They promise that we will have our bags in 24 hours but given all of the misinformation we have received at this point I am not holding my breath. No wonder they have dubbed this airline Air Canada Rogue. No leg room smaller seats no entertainment no hot beverages due to potential turbulence total incompetence from check-in to airport exit.
1937,21-24 March 10.20 departure arrived in Jamaica 1.20. Depart from Jamaica 2.40 arrives in Canada at 7.30. AC1805. The last time I flew Air Canada was 2007 so I decided to give them another chance. The plane was dirty no snacks on a 4 hour flight. The staff going down to my destination were neat and put together however the person doing the announcements needed some training. Entertainment both ways was horrible I could not even access it on my iPad. Comparing Rouge with WestJet and Air Transat they are so behind in time and entertainment. I am going away in June and there is a possibility that Air Canada Rouge will not be my first choice.
1938,"April 16 Budapest to Toronto via CDG. Business class on ""internal"" flights is economy with the centre of three seats left vacant. I found it very cramped for the two hours. My mother has a serious gluten food allergy. The breakfast on the internal flight was not gluten free. Apparently there are no ""special"" meals on internal flights. At least they should make sure nothing dangerous is served when they are aware of a food problem. She was given bread. No awareness by staff they had potentially caused a serious problem. Paris CDG to Toronto was fine. Old type business class on a 777. The gluten free meal was served frozen. Staff on board did what they could to try and thaw it. When thawed it was very dry chicken. My meal was foie gras very nice and banquette de veau very poor considering it is to France what pot roast is to North America hard to mess up. Staff were excellent and apologetic for the short comings."
1939,BHX-CDG-CPT young family economy. Outbound - Good service at BHX using gate ref for transfer at CDG = no problem B777 fresh interior attentive staff made allowance for 2 small children IFE good for adults (maybe needs wider content for kids). Overnight flight well managed by cabin crew food actually quite good. Return - Unable to self service check in (CPT staff unhelpful) CPT v small departures lounge B777 again night flight completely full 1no IFE slightly damaged but functional cabin crew again very receptive (bulk head seat) evening meal and hot breakfast. Transfer again at CDG no issue. BHX arrival simple and fast. Recommend rather than LHR.
1940,AF 1186 CDG-LJU March 13 2015. Nothing special on this flight from Paris to Ljubljana. It is a quick non-stop airlink between the two capital cities clean and newish Embraer regional jet basic service (crackers and soft drinks). Nothing to notice but the fact that I should not have been flying that day. I had to do it because AF canceled my flight of March 20 and I had to make new arrangements. My wife had three flights canceled on Feb 11 Feb 23 and April 9. Two of these flights were supposed to connect with AF long haul flights. As this is a single daily flight no other non-stop option is available and passengers need to take connecting flights that triple the trip length. These systematic cancellations are legal as in the EU airlines can cancel flights two weeks in advance without any penalty.
1941,I took the JFK to Madrid in Business class - the food was well below average the service was ok the crew did not care about customers and had fun all night on my return flight in the kitchen making the business class customer sleep impossible. On the round trip I had 2 hours delay in NY and 1 hour in Madrid. I was told to be lucky because the day before they had 10 hours delay. On the entertainment side 5 movies which are the same on both legs. I won't fly them again!
1942,PMI-BCN. Fast check-in. 35 min flight without service - as expected. Very comfortable plane arrived on time. Definitely recommended.
1943,Flew Air Canada Rouge to/from Costa Rica. Had never heard of Rouge and was not told that this would be the carrier even when I called to book seats and meals. There are no meals unless you buy the overpriced cold items available - very limited choice as would be expected on a flight. Had we known we would have brought our own food as we did on the return flight. Entertainment available by Air Canada app that must be downloaded before flight. A few tablets are available for rent - and they go fast. Seats are not comfortable - spent a week with back pain after 5 hours in one. There is also barely enough room to get into your seat. I'm not a large person but it was a challenged getting in and out of seat. Have flown Air Canada before and was happy with it. Not happy with Rouge and as you don't know if they will be the carrier when you book through Air Canada this will prevent me from ever booking a vacation or flight with them again. Cabin staff were friendly but not really helpful - there didn't seem to be anything they could do to help.
1944,Flew Air Canada rouge Toronto to Grenada return March 3 and 10 2014. Will never fly it again. A disgrace for a any airline let alone what they term a discount airline. Will travel to US or make connections on other airlines before I fly them again. After a week of sun and relaxing to have to endure seats with no leg room and no entertainment or even a 25 cent bag of peanuts who needs this. Get Real Air Canada rouge. You say all is well but people will only fly once and say goodbye forget your return flyers.
1945,Traveled from YYZ-MCO MCO-YYZ both flights were on time. The flight attendants are nice and helpful but a little disorganized. The plane was en airbus A319 and was modern and clean both ways. Seat are not very comfy plus there no legroom and you are squished in the seats. The service on the plane and at the airport are good. Movie system has new shows but old eps. Overall both flights were good. There is a good selection of food and drinks.
1946,CDG to Vancouver: New direct flight on April 12. Boarding slightly chaotic no FA at the aircraft door to welcome passengers. Captain decided to upgrade a friend and have them sat next to me blocking my aisle access. This is a usual issue with Air France and KLM once the doors are closed staff on free tickets are upgraded and high fare paying passengers are asked to move around to accommodate them. Simply appalling. Service was curt and staff busy chit chatting with their upgraded colleagues. The purser profusely apologized but stated there was little she could do. Food was good and plentiful. Audio video completely sub-par.
1947,I flew HND to CDG on the new Business Class. The seat is far better. Service and food always good. One small issue: new entertainment system takes at least 20 minutes to understand unless you are a specialist. Typically French: not intuitive at all complex and could have been much better if tested on real customers. Once you understand how to use it one must admit the offer is great. One big problem: they have only two toilets for business class (65 seats!) ! They had three before! Surprise surprise everybody waits in line for ages! This is a terrible mistake they made! The funny thing is that they want to upscale!
1948,I booked Air France from New Delhi India for my travel to UK and Europe. The following are the major issues with this airline. 1) The flight leaves New Delhi at midnight AF 225 and the cabin crew were unhelpful and rude. 2) No proper meal was served only midnight snacks. 3) No liquor served at all. 4) You ask for tea or coffee you will be frowned at and occasionally will be shown a counter where water and hot drinks are kept for self service. 5) Inflight entertainment is awfully poor quality. 6) Seat quality is most uncomfortable. I am happy I didn't waste money on upgrading to premier economy.
1949,"Yesterday I flew from Malaga to Paris with Air Europa which was a code share with KLM. Being 6'5"" does have it's advantages but not when you are flying on a Boeing 737-800 in economy. I know this from several past experiences. That is why I was pleasantly surprised when the customer service agent at the check in counter offered me an extra room exit row seat without me even having to ask. From check in to landing everyone was totally professional and courteous. Nicely done Air Europa."
1950,LAS to YYZ March 2014. I am a loyal Air Canada flyer and mostly travel Executive Class. I am extremely disappointed with Rouge and how Air Canada is forcing its clients to use Rouge and has stopped regular Air Canada flights to my usual destinations. The planes are all very old and rickety and the attendants very inexperienced although all friendly. It would be different if the fares dropped in half but they are exactly the same which is ridiculous. I am looking for alternatives as I will not be forced to receive second class service for the same high prices the entertainment system is poor and they show movies on an old tube screen but do not provide the ancient headphone adapters so what's the point.
1951,"Just came back from a trip to Orlando from Toronto. Purchased my tickets on Air Canada only to find out a few weeks before that I got ""Rouged"". I am an Air Canada Altitude Elite 50K member and fly on mainline AC quite frequently. When I bought my ticket in April 2013 I expected to fly on the airline I originally booked with but that was not the case. They switched my flight without warning. Getting on the plane the first thing you notice is how they squeezed all the seats together to give you no leg room. Unless you are a young child your knees will be plastered against the seat back in front of you. Good luck with the inflight non-entertainment system - you will need to remember to charge your device completely because there are no outlets. Also the movies were all second rate. Best of luck trying to get any work done the cramped room does not allow a regular sized laptop to be placed on the tray table without being squeezed between your abdomen and the seat in front."
1952,They kept us on an airplane for 2 hours initially hardly any circulation trying to fix a problem with the navigation system. Then they left us on the plane for 2 hours while they tried to fix it giving us false hope every 30 minutes or so. They offered some of us a tiny bag of almonds but we had to share with the person beside us because they didn't have enough for everyone. Finally they got us off the plane 2 hours later. Gave us $10 to buy lunch. Flight was supposed to leave at 10.30am at 1.30pm or so we get an announcement saying flight will be leaving at 3pm. Then another delay to 4pm. Meanwhile the weather outside is getting worse and worse. So now we board at 4pm. They had us sit on the airplane for another 3 hours before we actually took off. 200+ people missed a whole day of vacation time. Updates were very infrequent. To top it all off the flight crew were miserable. They were finally walking by to offer us some food but a) they ran out of everything and b) they walked right by our row without asking. When I waved my hand the attendant got annoyed with me. It was the last time I fly with Air Canada. The free food was a sandwich. The drinks - they gave you pop juice or water and you couldn't have an actual can. Inflight entertainment - forget it. They didn't play a movie on the way to Montego Bay. You had to have the app downloaded on your phone. If you didn't have the app you got nothing.
1953,We booked flights from Birmingham International to Paris CDG as we were going to Disneyland Paris. We were booked onto the 6.25am flight for which we arrived at BHX two hours prior to departure only to find that our flight was actually being handled by FlyBe. After over an hour in the check-in queue we heard a message that there was a computer error we were devastated when our flight was instructed to take off without us and approximately 60 other passengers as we couldn't be checked in at this time. We were travelling with two young children and a baby and were disgusted at the lack of organisation by the airline in the hours that followed. We were not spoken to by any members of staff about what to do next but told to go and have breakfast with our Â£5 food vouchers what can Â£ Â£5 buy you in an airport? I refused to leave the check-in desk until I had details about our re-booked flights and after five hours of sitting on the airport floor complaining I finally managed to get a member of staff to book us on to the next flight to Lyon where there would be a connecting flight to Paris. By the time we landed at Paris CDG we had been travelling for fourteen hours and the children were distressed hungry and tired. To then be told that this incompetent airline had lost one of our suitcases and my pushchair was the final straw.
1954,"Air France has a reputation of serving excellent food and good wines. It has however introduced in business class what it calls a new ""light"" menu. In fact the light offering is little more than an excuse to serve minuscule portions under the guise of the now discredited ""nouvelle cuisine"". The chief purser on the flight assured me that the new menu was popular but a quick unscientific survey of my fellow passengers seemed to show the opposite. For the record first course was a tiny block of Foie Gras with overlooked mixed vegetables. Followed by shrimps in a brown tasteless sauce and mashed potatoes (difficult to identify). The desert was a stale pastry. The guest chef (unknown outside of France) who prepared this offering clearly needs extra training on the impact of altitude on the taste of food come on Air France bring back the much loved classic menu. Meanwhile on a long flight if not on a diet bring your own sandwiches!"
1955,Return flight London to Paris (AF 1081 and AF 1080) Flight was on time aircraft was good and flight attendants attentive. Really enjoyed flying with Air France.
1956,We (spouse and myself) used AE for a return trip to Cuba via Madrid. Though in most ways the airline was acceptable rather than good or better the food was unspeakably bad. The evening meal was something that passed for pasta - in truth it was a congealed mess not warm and in no way tasty. Breakfast comprised a box with a roll with a tiny blob of butter and a piece of processed meat thrown in. Completely unacceptable. I will not fly them again.
1957,I thought this airline was very good. 23kg for luggage so I took some golf clubs. Flight was cheap. The service onboard was limited but it didn't need to be overcomplicated on a 2 hour flight from London to Madrid. Flights were on time and got to the destination a bit early both ways. Luggage was on the conveyor at the other end as soon as I arrived.
1958,Feb 27 2014. When we original booked this flight from Toronto to Orlando return it was with Air Canada. When Air Canada up and decided to change the flights to Rouge there was no compensation for cost given as a refund or credit as Rouge is supposedly a cheaper flight. This fact was confirmed by speaking with other passengers on the flight who booked the flight through Air Canada Rouge. Not only did they not compensate us for the change they automatically changed our seating - splitting my husband and myself approximately 8 rows apart. I would also confirm that I had to prepay for seat selection. When I went to check in online the flight was sold out and I could not get my seat that I had paid for back. The new seats are horrible. I am only 5 feet and I couldn't get comfortable with the decreased leg room. I don't know how they expect people to sit in these seats for a 5 plus hour flight. They have taken out the TVs in the seats. They boast themselves as having a huge selection of movies etc. with their new app that has to be downloaded. Their huge selection is worse and older than Netflix. It really is a joke. If you want anything that is enjoyable make sure you download your own movies/shows before flying. Next time look at WestJet before booking Air Canada.
1959,"I am relatively tall and have just experienced the most uncomfortable flight in my (substantial) list of flights (over 50 years). In the interest of (literally) squeezing the last buck out of their aircraft's potential they have shortened (even further) the distance between seats making it impossible for me to withdraw my legs to sitting properly behind the seat ahead! Totally ridiculous whoever came up with this ""brilliant"" move must have been a height challenged individual."
1960,On March 2 2014 we flew back from Puerto Vallarta on Air Canada Rouge (flight A/C 1819). Was it a good experience? No. It was an awful experience. Rouge makes us see red. The seats in the plane were so crammed up that we felt that we were in a can of sardines One of us is 1 m 90 tall Consequently his knees were stuck in the seat in front of him with no way of stretching his legs. Many passengers with mobility issues had a hard time getting out of their seat (e.g: to go to the washroom). Rouge is a poor service and shame on Air Canada for offering it. It shows disrespect to the clientele. We?™d rather pay more money to get a better service and have more space. We expect a better service.
1961,BMX-Paris. Very good service. Cabin crew were polite and attentive. Helped to find our connecting flight. No inflight entertainment but not an issue as was a very short flight. Seating was 3-3 across but were only the normal economy seats but had middle seat left empty and the armrests could be moved so not impressed by this. Food was very good and well presented. Felt service was what sold this flight to me. When traveling business with other airlines you can see the difference in seating. Liked the flight but would not recommend Air France over other airlines.
1962,KL to Paris. Service: Male cabin crew were rude and unhelpful. After the first meal there is no sign of crew for around 7 hours. No drinks offered. Food is poor. TV was broken. Asked to have it looked at. Never happened. Based on what my partner could see there were very few options and few recent films. Old aircraft with old seat. Very disappointed by this flight.
1963,I've had the misfortune of flying Air France on many occasions and every time I am let down by some aspect of it. It is only through desperation I use the airline now and I would willingly pay over their price to avoid it. As a frequent flyer from Saudi Arabia I find AF charter Saudi Air flights and pass them off as their own. For me this is unacceptable. If I wanted Saudi Air I would book Saudi Air. The toilets are always dirty and smelly the flight crew generally miserable and there are always extremely badly behaved kids crawling over the seats. What I've also found is the passengers here cannot wait for the plane to stop before they're out of their seats and there is no admonishment from the staff. The food is always bland and as cheap as possible they can't even be bothered buttering the sandwiches and the excuse for dinner is laughable. There is zero inflight entertainment. I've also had occasion to speak to the staff at CDG airport possibly the most frustrating airport in the world and they are the rudest I have ever come across. I really dislike both Saudi Air and Air France for these reasons. I would definitely not recommend.
1964,BRU-MAD return flight on E195. Planes are new and clean. Seats comfortable and reasonable leg room. Flights on time. Food for purchase no IFE (which is normal on a 2 hour flight). Flight attendants very nice. Good value for money!
1965,MAD-Milan return. Both flights on time. Check in was fast no long lines. Boarding by rows. Planes both ways nice 737 comfortable and nice mood lighting. Very nice and professional crew. No IFE food for purchase. Bags on belt short after arrival.
1966,LGW-MAD. Flight supposedly on Embraer aircraft but instead on 737. Very good legroom for what is in effect a low cost shuttle flight. Comfy seats. Flight left and arrived on time. Only food available was to buy.
1967,"Legroom comfortable, cabin very quiet and LED lighting gives a great feel. Charging and USB socket on every seat very helpful. The crew were smiling and courteous, and food extremely good. Best service to date with Air India, except for the immigrations and customs in Delhi which could be done directly in Bangalore."
1968,YYZ-MCO-YYZ. Family of 5 travelling in economy. On time departures both ways. Flight crew was very friendly and attentive (also much younger than the average AC flight crew which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Aircraft was an A319 in rouge livery. Pretty basic but clean and nice. The only catch is the IFE is Wifi-based so you have to have an IPhone or IPad with the AC app or you need to rent one in flight for $10. Fortunately they told us this before we departed so we were able to download the app.
1969,LAS-YUL on March 14. First impression is that legroom is very tight as compared to regular AC flight on a similar airplane so much that my legs hurt at the end of the 5hr trip (and I'm no big guy). Catering goes as always from front to rear and food is for purchase. If your seat is at the back of the plane good luck getting proper food you'll have to make do with chips and chocolate bars. I did not use the wi-fi flight entertainment system but others tried and were not able to get the feature working properly. Staff friendly but issues are not related to them. It just feels as if Air Canada has decided to cheap out as much as they can while still charging a premium.
1970,I took AC Rouge for a flight back from Las Vegas. Flight attendants were very young and inexperienced. Very poor service onboard one beverage service for a 5 hours flight (FA's having fun in the back of the plane for the rest of the time). No announcement from the captain. Very few iPads available. I'm a frequent traveller with AC I will avoid Rouge.
1971,"Have flown to Paris multiple times from various airports in the UK on many different airlines. Air France is without doubt the worst option in my opinion. Every time I have attempted to check in online I have had an error message and then when trying to check in electronically at the airport I've had the same error message and had to go queue and check in manually. On top of the inconvenience this causes it also limits your seat choosing options. On 2 occasions I've ended up in the 'middle' seat. Be warned the arm rests are actually on this seat (as opposed to equally split between the two seats). That means that the seat is incredibly tight - I'm a 34"" waist and it was uncomfortable - I imagine for anyone larger it would become physically impossible. Overall an incredibly arrogant airline. Avoid and go with British Airways or a budget alternative."
1972,GIG-MUC via CDG on B773 and A321. Flights were on time and all in all fine. Long haul flight landed even 50 min early in Paris. FA's were friendly. Food was good especially the wine. I didn't like the very uncomfortable seat on the 777-300 it was impossible to sleep in it. The seat pitch on the other hand was fine. In total I had good flights with Air France. They brought me safe and on time to my final destination.
1973,"MAD-EZE Airbus A332.Clean aircraft but not much legroom. Flight left 20 mins late but caught up time and arrived on schedule in Buenos Aires. Food OK. Three meals served one of which breakfast was merely a snack. Monitor in my seatback did not work and as the plane was full no chance of moving. Very little ""non- Spanish"" entertainment played in any case."
1974,London to Gran Canaria via Madrid Business Class. Food was disgusting tiny portions on plastic plates. Worse than economy on most airlines. Service was non existent. This is not a real business class. Never again.
1975,"The positives: The Dreamliner is an excellent and new aircraft and for once everything on it worked and was clean and well maintained. The lie flat bed in business was excellent. Much more spacious than the United product or the Smartium business bed on Asiana and others. The layout of the seats is a bit different - less privacy but more open feeling and real space. Comfy duvet and blankets provided on this night flight. Cabin crew although older (55+) were very well trained, warm, polite and efficient. They came around repeatedly talking to the passengers and making sure we were comfortable and seemed to genuinely care. In fact their efforts helped overcame the other deficiencies in the hard product. Compared to the brusque automatons on United these folks were full of smiles and eager to please. Also the Indian food selection was delicious. The negatives: compared to the premium airlines AI is clearly not as polished or well organized. Meals were provided all at once in a single tray - not course by course as on other airlines. Menus was not provided. Wine choice was very limited. Champagne was served lukewarm. After dinner the crew disappeared and did not patrol the aisles refilling glasses - but then passengers were asleep and I'm sure if anyone had requested they would have come right away. Movie selection though limited was not as bad as I had imagined. It would be nice to have served a quick snack or wake-up drink prior to landing. It was strange that the only announcement we got to wake us up was the one saying we were preparing to land! Overall a good product and definitely exceeded expectations. Not on par as Singapore, Emirates and Asian carriers but solidly good overall."
1976,Flight of 9 hours from Delhi to London on 777-300 series. Managed to book seat 42 which is an aisle seat in line of 3 with no seat in front of it. Great leg room plus middle seat next to me was empty. 2 meals offered plus drinks and flight was on time. Crew worked hard at offering water and juice during flight and arrived in London dead on time.
1977,Evening flight from Heathrow on Air India 777-300 to Delhi. Left on time and arrived slightly early 2 meals offered plus drink service. Plenty of time to sleep and arrive refreshed at lunchtime Delhi time Again managed to book seat 42 with no seat in front but did move in flight to an empty row of 3 which allowed some better sleep. Crew excellent as have been previous flights on Air India
1978,After reviewing the webpage for Rouge I charged up my laptop and tablets to make use of the entertainment system on board that streams content to your device. For the flight to the destination the onboard system malfunctioned flight attendants were unable to make it work for any passengers. For the flight back home it was working however after trying to stream the content for 30 minutes on each of my devices I asked the flight attendants why it was not working and they replied that the service is for Apple customers only. Air Canada Rouge should specify that only Apple products will work with their systems. Seat pitch was uncomfortable in the A319. On the way to my destination attendants came only once with food and beverage service for a 4.5 hour flight. Also I was under the impression that Air Canada had to hire bilingual staff members where the only French that the flight attendants were able to speak was when they were reading the safety demonstration card and the landing card. They were not even able to provide accurate translations of the Captains announcements. Not impressed.
1979,AC 126 Edmonton to Toronto Mar 1. AC 1874 Toronto to Orlando Mar 1. AC 1875 Orlando to Toronto Mar 14. AC 175 Toronto to Edmonton Mar 14 2014. Air Canada Rouge is definitely not up to Air Canada standards! I fly AC on a weekly basis and took a trip down south with my family on AC rouge. It is not the AC that I am used to that is for sure. Bad seats no leg room and multiple delays on both legs 9 the trip. I am loyal AC customer but won't fly rouge again.
1980,"Toronto to Montego Bay return. Cabin outdated and in need of serious attention. Inflight ""entertainment"" is wildly outdated. Good point: I travelled in business class and food was pretty good. Service a bit slow but at least we got fed. Overall average and definitely not worth the cost."
1981,Flew CDG to JFK. Very effective service on the ground and onboard the plane. Food and wine were fine. Only problem was luggage delivery (30 minutes + and no priority at all despite proper yellow tag). Always the same problem with AF: they promise more than they can deliver. Furthermore as always in France no proper customers service!
1982,Flew CDG to JFK. Very effective service on the ground and onboard the plane. Food and wine were fine. Only problem was luggage delivery (30 minutes + and no priority at all despite proper yellow tag). Always the same problem with AF: they promise more than they can deliver. Furthermore as always in France no proper customers service!
1983,PVG-CDG-VIE last month PVG-CDG on brand new A380 check-in at PVG airport handled by China Eastern staff very rude and inefficient even I'm Elite Plus member of Skyteam lounge is good with plenty of hot food/wine/champagne at PVG. A380 economy seat is comfortable and spacious AVOD is fantastic. Good quality food and wine. No water/drinks served during the dinner and breakfast and you need go to galley to get water by yourself. CDG-VIE on A320 nothing to say as its European short-haul flight.
1984,"BCN-CDG-HND in Premium Economy. The first leg from BCN had drama. It was the last flight of a day when a flight had been cancelled earlier and seating was overbooked. I was assigned a middle seat. One of the flaws of their intra-Europe flights is that you cannot ever book your seat in advance and I paid for my ticket 8 months in advance! Previously I was served a meal on this short flight but not this one. We were only given a small dry sandwich and a cup of water (no second drinks service). The flight attendant in charge seemed to care less about anyone in the ""premium cabin"". Air France make no effort to distinguish the intra-Europe premium economy experience apart from you being seated near the front. The late night flight to HND on a newly refurbished 777-200 was actually quite nice. The crew were very accommodating and the toilets were clean throughout. The premium economy seat was OK but you cannot get any sleep in them as many have said. The entertainment system is updated with touch screens though I couldn't find much to watch. I ordered a special Lentore meal in advance and it was delicious. The standard pre-arrival breakfast was dreadful. No food offered between meal times during the 11+ hour flight. The only good thing about being in premium economy is knowing you're not squeezed into economy. Overall not a very positive experience for me this journey."
1985,"Flew London - Madrid - Caracas and return. Cheap on time comfortable adequate leg room (I'm 6' 4"") but suggest seats B or G on the aisle."
1986,London Gatwick to Madrid in Oct 2012. Ordered extra legroom seats for 20 euros each way checked in online too. Check-in was quick boarding was on time and took off at the correct time - no delays. Staff onboard were able to speak both Spanish and English and sold a range of snacks drinks and other items - very reasonably priced and able to take credit cards. Flew on a Boeing 737-800 and an Embraer 195 jet aircraft. Flight itself was faultless - very comfortable seating heating in cabin was very good - excellent airline will look forward to flying them again!
1987,Air India Dreamliner from Delhi to Melbourne pulled away from the gate on time but during taxi returned back to a different gate due to a technical issue. Took 1.5 hours to fix during which time lunch and drinks service was offered. Once fault repaired flight underway almost 2 hours late. Little time made up of passage to Melbourne so arrived about 1.5 hours late which did squeeze connections from Melbourne. Air India had rebooked passengers who missed their connections and this was communicated on arrival as to new flight details Flight was comfortable with 2 meals plus snack and drinks offered. Crew again work hard keeping passengers comfortable and well hydrated. This was 4th Air India flight in space of a month and have to say was impressed in the offering. Would definitely fly them again if offered.
1988,Flew Air India Dreamliner from Melbourne to Delhi. Plane very comfortable seating arrangements good with plenty of space even for me at 6???? it was a day flight and 2 meals and a snack pack supplied on the journey of 12 hours which was a surprise. Meal choice of Indian veg or meat plus European choice of chicken with pasta. Drinks also offered each service. Crew offered plenty of water or juice throughout the flight and snacks and drinks available in the galley if required. Restrooms kept clean during flight. If there was a downside of Air India perhaps the in flight entertainment is a little limited but was adequate for the flight.
1989,Second experience with Air Canada Rouge. AC 1871 MCO to YUL Feb 28 seat 3A on an Airbus A319. There was no premium class on this flight so all seats are available in the first 3 rows and no other perk than an extra 6 inches of leg room. Cannot use E-Upgrades certificate to get these seats only available for a fee of $30 unless you are lucky and these are the only seat available when you board. Plane was full. Take-off was aborted in the middle of the runway for a faulty alarm apparently we had to go back to gate. After several passengers asked for it one FA passed the water. FA had plastic smiles (not as genuine as my first flight) and seemed very tired. We landed about 90 min late from schedule. I find slim line seats to be uncomfortable after 30 minutes so this delay was not welcome. In addition I wanted to do some work on my computer but as the person in front of me decided to recline his seat I had no room to open the laptop and work on it. Level of service and comfort comparable to Allegiant who offers the flight to BTV for $111. Not at all comparable to AC Main Line service and comfort but price is the same. IMO comparable to lower class airline service like Ryan Air Allegiance Jet Blue at a premium.
1990,My first AC Rouge flight YYZ-LAS on a 767 in Premium Rouge. With all the griping previously posted here I was curious and apprehensive. Aside from the change in IFE (streaming vs VOD) the flight was very similar to AC mainline North American service. FA's pleasant and attentive breakfast nice on time arrival and departure. No complaints at all though I imagine those on the narrowbody service will be surprised by the seating configuration in Premium.
1991,Johannesburg to LHR via Paris. The long-haul was a 'curate's egg' of a journey. On-time comfortable seats at the front of the 380 (Â£50 extra well-spent) good choice of entertainment but slow service for drinks and dinner - the nastiest airline meal I've had in years. No water runs through the night and woken up nearly two hours before touchdown to serve breakfast. The CDG-LHR sector was normal short-haul experience.
1992,I chose Air France to fly from Paris to Djakarta in September because it was incredibly cheap. I'll never understand airline pricing policies: this flight was cheaper than flying from Paris to Glasgow! The flight was not crowded so I had a whole row of seats to myself and was thus able to put my feet up which was an unexpected luxury when flying in economy (hence the five stars for seat comfort and value for money). I fly very frequently and hadn't flown with Air France on a long-haul flight for many years and was very pleasantly surprised by the food. It was delicious and a real cut above all the meals I've eaten aboard Emirates Qatar Aeroflot Singapore China Eastern etc. over the past few years. The cabin crew were charming friendly (mostly fairly mature men which as a woman I find a pleasant change from the often surly and very young women aboard many of the other airlines) and efficient. Given the choice another time I'd fly with this airline again.
1993,ORY-MAD-ORY. Got upgraded both ways but Business class service rather inconsistent. Outbound B737-800 - cabin too hot comfortable leather seats with decent legroom blocked middle seat. Got some newspapers and a welcome juice in a plastic glass. After takeoff purser offered another juice and some peanuts - and that was it: No meal on a two-hour- flight! Inbound Embraer 195 - I like the 2x2 seating configuration cabin freezing cold. Neither newspapers nor welcome drink. But got a small cold tray as dinner. Cabin crew served some coffee then disappeared until landing. Lounge in MAD fairly spacious - good drink selection but disappointing food offer with only a few nibbles. Ticket fare quite competitive and I appreciated the upgrade gesture - but would definitely not pay for Business class.
1994,Flew Gatwick to Madrid then Madrid to Lima yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. After reading the reviews below I was expecting a horror story. First flight took off on time. Second flight took off 45 minutes late but landed around 45 minutes early. Seats are comfy enough not amazing. Staff were pleasant. Food was better than a lot of other airlines I have been on. Considering my flight only cost about 580 pounds booked two days before departure I would say it is excellent value for money. Similar fares to Lima were costing around 900 pounds. Perhaps I just got lucky but I would give Air Europa the thumbs up.
1995,"The quality of the airline has deteriorated badly. My first connection BOM-DEL was delayed with prior intimation which was fine. I reached DEL at the eleventh hour when the boarding for PAR had already begun. I met the worst ground staff at DEL airport who don't even know how to behave with a passenger and behave as if doing a big favour. I was not attended by any transit desk people and when contacted the AI staff asked me to run behind people on transit to other destinations that was just so cheap. Next thing was the annoying security check which took nearly 30 minutes with a quick immigration for transit passengers. The flight was quite empty and quite comfortable, with friendly cabin crew. But the flight was mostly full of foreigners and the announcement was missing in French and the really fast Indian English was really sad for the French people who kept asking me to translate what they meant. Arrival in Paris was very smooth. I wouldn't mind flying with AI but I would never ever fly via DEL airport again in my life except for my return flight and I would not mind shelling out some extra chunks for this matter. The ticket was the cheapest even at the last minute."
1996,"The flight AI301 scheduled at 7am of 14th May never left Melbourne because of an engine problem. They rescheduled us on a 2pm Thai flight on route Melbourne-Bangkok-Delhi. I got to Delhi at 3am instead of 6pm, when I booked the tickets through the Melbourne office they guaranteed me the transit hotel because my connection was more than 17 hours. When I got to Delhi a rude company attendant told me that they don't give this kind of service so I spent more than 10 hours on the airport. No way to speak with someone from the company during all this time. Air India never again - saved $300 compare with Emirates but a big mistake. Complain to the company and still waiting for an answer."
1997,YYZ-VRA Feb 6 AC Rouge 1752. VRA-YYZ Feb 13 AC Rouge 1753. This is Air Canada's new flag carrier. Stay away unless you like the smallest leg room in the air. If the seat ahead of you is reclined even slightly no room on the tray for even a coke can! Staff are annoyingly friendly with silly banter and phoney smiles. Absolutely no in- flight entertainment unless you bring a device and pre-install proprietary software. On the upside 100lb baggage allowance is highest around.
1998,"Despite all the previous comments on this website about how poor Rouge is I have just come back from a trip to Las Vegas from Toronto and found the airline to be more than adequate. The aircraft itself was in good shape the seating was 2-3-2 in economy. I sat in an exit seat on the way out and in a bulkhead seat on the way back and had lots of legroom and the seats themselves were not too narrow even for me as a 6'2"" guy. The staff were very competent and helpful and the service was good throughout. Their uniforms are a bit silly but there you go. The on-board food selection was OK absolutely not any worse than any other airline believe me. The on-board entertainment although a bit different (had to have an app on a laptop or ipad) was perfectly good although slightly limited. I did not pay to access this. Overall on this route and with this aircraft all was good and no issues whatsoever."
1999,CDG-MAD-CDG-ZAG quite new airplanes on CDG-MAD-CDG route fast and smooth boarding on both airports and decent onboard service. CDG-ZAG route operated with smaller and a bit dated plane (HOP regional) but still good service and all flights on time.
2000,On a flight from BKK to CDG nothing was served to eat for 9 hours. There was a self-service bar but they had run out of everything except water. The cabin crew did nothing except sitting in galley chatting with each other. They were not interested in us passengers at all. Air France is by far the worst airline i have traveled with. If you are going on a long haul flight with AF don't forget to bring some sandwiches with you because you might need it.
2001,"Flying MAD-JFK and back. First flight not bad taking off near the right time flying with a relative comfort and arriving ok. But the way back - the flight supposed to be taking off at 10pm was delayed and delayed and delayed. After 5 hours waiting for any information it was cancelled. The staff were polite but really ineffective. Instead of taking a passenger list and assign them a hotel it was a ""first come first served"" without any control. Next morning no Air Europa staff appeared. Finally at 3pm a bus took us to the airport. At the airport Air Europa lanes were empty no staff. After half an hour someone appeared. Fortunately we were at the right place and took an advanced place in the lane. Very fortunately because only 30 passengers were assigned a flight that day at 10pm. No additional information for the rest of passengers just lane shut down and good bye. Finally with an additional delay of two hours we left JFK. As a final screw our luggage was not flying with us so we needed to wait additional 24h to have it."
2002,You really do get what you pay for. They are cheap and that's what you should expect on board. Their boarding desk in JFK is in the back of the airport with no signs to help you locate it. The line is absurdly long and you get the impression when you give them your luggage that you may never see it again. The security check also left a little something to be desired in terms of safety. On board my TV did not work and my chair did not recline. It was a great flight from NY to Madrid! If I was not so cheap I would go elsewhere and will in the future.
2003,"Milan-JFK with a 4-hour layover in Madrid. When I asked to confirm my exit row seats on the Milan-Madrid flight assigned on the phone we were told by the gate agent that we had them - row 9 of the 737. That somehow didn't sound right but two agents couldn't be wrong. Of course these were normal economy seats with the spacious 30-inch pitch that tall people love. Luckily the exit row seats (actually row 14) were open and we grabbed them just when the door closed. On Madrid-JFK leg I had paid for the ""extra room"" economy seats something I found out was available by chance on the AE web site. But remember that gate agent in Milan who assigned row 9 as exit? She somehow did know enough to recognize that the assigned ""extra room"" seats were actually a bulkhead row with no extra room. It took several conversations in Madrid to secure actual ""extra room"" seats which are in fact exit rows on the AirBus. This saved the trip back to JFK from being a miserable disaster. We were lucky I guess that things sort of worked out. But I hate to think how many travellers are victims of a staff that needs to go back to basic training. How does this airline function?"
2004,Flight was half empty. Crew were cordial and food was served immediately. The light-changing windows were slightly annoying. Prefer Jet for short-haul and domestic routes.
2005,"I read some bad reviews but it was mentioned the 787 was better. Not so in my case. I had an aisle seat. The seat reclining feature didn't work. I was forced to sit upright for the whole red eye flight of over 8 hours. The light switch on the remote didn't work so I couldn't even read. The lady in the window seat also had trouble with her seat. The food was not that great. The cabin staff were fine but not anything special like Emirates. About two hours after take off the cabin and lavatories were trashed. Safety was never an issue. All in all, I will avoid Air India, at least until I see some better reviews."
2006,First AC Rouge flight YYZ-SJO December 2013. Flight was on time and no problems with the service. Wifi based entertainment system didn't work. Generally this is a big step down from regular service and why can't I now book business to SJO or BCN?
2007,Terrible. I flew from Sudbury to Toronto to get this flight and the little Dash 8 from Sudbury had more legroom. The lady in front reclined so I watched her hair for 3 hours. Could not see my smartphone even if I had been stupid enough to pay for inflight entertainment on a 4 inch screen.
2008,Flew Zurich CDG Atlanta return in Premium Economy. Would normally fly Swiss or Lufthansa but needed a late flight back from Atlanta so chose Air France. Have to say the premium economy seats are roomy allowing me to work during the outward bound flight to USA but they are very hard and do not recline properly so was not able to sleep much during the return night flight. Food was disappointing I think Lufthansa offer the better choice of meals. Also the choice of drinks was poor and the attendants were not too helpful. On the return journey they didn't distribute the kit with toothpaste face mask etc. Choice of inflight films was quite good although the picture quality of the monitor was poor. Priority channel for boarding and check in is OK but CDG transfers and lounges are a nightmare bursting to the seams with passengers not enough seating and not enough toilets.
2009,"AF 522 CDG to Cape Town 2/2/15. Service diabolical seat uncomfortable food and beverage very average - all in all the most underwhelming of experiences just like BA in their nationalised period. The most extraordinary experience was to be told by 2 stewardesses over an hour between them to put out my reading light and go to sleep. 58 years ago aged 6 I might have accepted it but how utterly inappropriate behaviour. The first one actually reached past me and switched it off (this was maybe 30 minutes after they dimmed cabin lights after very poor food service). An hour or so later the second one tried and got a very brusque ""go away and leave me alone"" from me. This stunned her into saying ""you can't speak to me like that"" to which I responded ""I have now go away"". When did it become company policy for AF to treat customers like 6 year olds? Probably the most unsatisfactory flight I've ever taken."
2010,Flights to Gran Canaria. If you book from the UK and select seats online they won't be there when you get to the airport and you will end up at the back of the plane as we did the connection in Madrid was horrendous and all our liquids including duty free was taken off us because we had to connect by bus in another terminal! The flight to Gran Canaria was good. The return was the same at check-in seats we had booked via the UK were not there we were offered rows at the back of the plane on the flight from Madrid to London the change at Madrid was the same horrendous with lots of furious passengers due to the heat no air conditioning in the transit lounge and very little time to catch the next flight. Planes on all occasions never used a gate once everyone was via bus so the flight time is good but the rest of it was bad. We had 75 minutes to make our connection after we touched down but we were so far away from the terminals by the time we arrived at the plane it was 10 minutes before take off and people were still getting on 15 minutes after we should have taken off - this happened both ways!
2011,London-Madrid flight with a connection to Caracas on Friday 24/08. Arriving at London Airport Air Europa staff informed us the flight was delayed and they had no additional information. Hours later they inform us that our connection flights will wait for us in Madrid. Arriving at Madrid Air Europa informed us to run to the door and on arrival we were informed that they did not know they had to wait and that we were never on the waiting list which was already full. We had to wait until the next day to take the first flight to Caracas. When we got to the flight they informed us that we had to make a stop on Santiago de Compostela. Arriving in Santiago de Compostela we were asked to get off the plane and were standing on the plane for 20 minutes until they informed that we could not get off the plane. There was no communication Air Europa staff had no information and the only thing they told us was that we made a claim It caused us a big problem to lose a day trip which they never took responsibility. Last time I travel with them.
2012,Flew from JFK in New York to Madrid. The 10.05 pm flight took off at 2.20 am. Flew from Barcelona to Madrid. The 12.05 pm flight took off at 4 pm and fortunately the 5.35 flight from Madrid to JFK was also about an hour late so we didn't miss our connection. Needless to say the experience was terrible and the on ground support was poor. Nobody could explain the delays or even when the plane would be ready to take off. The messages posted about departures never change so that regardless when the flight boarded and was scheduled to depart only the original information appeared. In addition our dietary requests - made far enough in advance were ignored on the flight to Spain but honored on the return trip.
2013,"LHR-ATQ via DEL in Business Class. Check in was a bit busy but we were checked in quick and given our boarding passes for all onwards flights. But we found out at check in that we would have to re-check our bags in at DEL. Air India lounge at LHR is very nice. Good choices of canapÃ©s and drinks. Boarding was a complete disaster, there was no separate queue for Business or First class passengers. Boarding drinks with a choice of orange juice or Champagne. Food was not the greatest and the seats were old. Landed in DEL ontime and had to re-check our bags in which was alright because, they have separate queues here. The lounge at DEL was very quiet and we were the only people in the lounge for a while. DEL-ATQ sector had a 2 hour delay because, but on the upside we were upgraded from Business to First which was a surprise. On this short flight we only got served nuts and drinks."
2014,"The service was adequate and friendly. Meal choice - Chicken/Fish/Vegetarian on the outgoing flight and kebabs as a big snack for the incoming overnight flight. In all a good return trip between Singapore and Goa via Mumbai. With this level of service, punctuality, leg room and price Air India is a good option. The negatives - I ordered a special (DBML) meal on the return flight but did not get it. Also Air India's online check-in has a glitch - I've faced this problem five times in the past (out of five attempts). The problem - at the end of the online check-in screens after entering passport and visa details, the system flashes an error message. At the airport staff struggle to rectify the error and have to consult manuals/supervisors etc. On the last occasion I tied up one check in counter for 20 minutes while they tried rectifying this problem."
2015,"AC1870 on Feb 17 seat 1A. I bought a flight pass for regular flights from Montreal to Orlando. Usually excellent service on Air Canada. They switched to Rouge last Monday. It is like buying a first class train ticket and being switched to a school bus. ""Premium"" class seats are economy poorly padded no working space. Entertainment system is an I - Pad (free in Premium - $10 in economy ) which works erratically at best. Staff doing their best with the tools they are given wearing a uniform that seems to have bought on sale at Giant Tiger."
2016,AC 1881 Feb 12 2014 Sarasota to Toronto. Delayed 4.5 to 5 hours as of now. No considerations to passengers. JetBlue also delayed but they brought in pizza and drinks for their passengers. Many considerations to those that smoke to leave the secure area but no food. All the kiosks have been closed at this airport by 6 pm!
2017,Flew from Toronto to Paris then on to Malaga on February 4th returned same route and airline February 24th. Never flown with Air France before but will from now on. Excellent cabin crews good food and wine clean comfortable jets on time never lost our baggage and short layovers in Paris both ways. I am booking second trip with them in September now.
2018,Flight to Cape Town from CDG. Booked premium economy for me and my wife 11.20pm. Take off on time - so far so good. The premium economy seat does not recline it just slides down a bit and a metal support strut for the seat in front is just where you want to put your foot. The seat is also hard and uncomfortable with what seems to be a metal bar running across the middle. Place the pillow under buttock to try to relive the pain. A full hour passed without any cabin staff making a appearance no aperitif no drink no nothing! Eventually some hour and ten minutes later a hostess brings a tray of food which has no resemblance to something you can actually eat one small bottle of vino and half a cup of coffee. That's it lights out and we never see anyone again until about 8.30am. No sleep at all the most uncomfortable flight ever. By 9am we are presented with more awful food and anther half cup of coffee. The return journey was no better and now we are awaiting our luggage as for some reason it did not fly with us. The touch screen inflight entertainment has a mind of its own and would not work properly. A real let down for the price.
2019,Missed a connecting flight with Virgin to Havana and Air Europa had the first flight out via Madrid. Unprofessional staff. No information about delays in English. Slowest boarding process I have ever been a part of. Very tight seats no video or custom entertainment (10h day flight).
2020,You get what you pay for (and sometimes you don't) - they were cheapest across the Atlantic but the seatback video choice was poor and some machines for our party didn't work. But they were the cheapest. When you don't get what you pay for: we booked an Air Europa flight not knowing it was a codeshare flight with Spanair. Spanair went bust on 27 January. We got an email over 4 months later telling us our flight had been cancelled. Unimpressive? I think so.
2021,"On both sectors shabby aircraft interiors. The general appearance of the staff specially on the return flight was appalling. The grooming standards were low. The stewardess greeting customers in the aisle was leaning on a seat head rest with her hands on her chin and yawning - not the image that Air India wants to portray. The whole service and meal tray could be better. Their website is good and easy to use, the call centre staff are very polite and efficient - the airport in Delhi is a delight."
2022,"DEL-LHR - Experience was overall satisfactory, within 20 minutes we reached cruising altitude and immediately snacks and drinks were served. I must say the flight steward looked dazed and did not look motivated. After serving food (very average), our plates were collected and cabin lights were immediately turned off. I did notice a few people wandering around the cabin, looking for a bite to eat and water/drinks. I was able to sleep well. Flight was on time, landed around 10 mins late into Heathrow. LHR-DEL - Experience was again a let down. To begin with we were 4.5 hours late, though we were informed well in advance. We finally boarded the aircraft and the first images of worn out carpets and shabby seat upholstery made the already disgruntled passengers more upset. Food was served very fast and lights were switched off! A couple of hours into our flight I got up to get a glass of water, I asked the air hostesses sitting at the back and they simply pointed their finger at a water dispenser, which I personally found very unprofessional. The experience at new Delhi T3 was a mood changer (for the good)!"
2023,Just returned from Huatulco Mexico. Booked our trip back in August with Air Canada. At the time had a choice of 3 airlines and even though Air Canada cost more money booked with them anyway as in the past were very happy with service flight and experience. Found out 2 weeks prior to our trip that we'd be flying Air Canada Rouge instead. Not at all a similar experience. Flight attendants were inexperienced and one was very rude. Airplane was freezing when we boarded in Toronto. Overall a horrible experience both ways. Won't book Air Canada again as there is no guarantee we'd be flying with them instead of Air Canada Rouge.
2024,YYZ to MCO and return in January. This was my first experience with Rouge (I had booked the flight before it was Rouged) and it was a major disappointment after flying regularly with AC for the last 30 years. The seats were not comfortable and the pitch is inadequate. The inflight entertainment is a joke nobody in their right mind should rent an ipad or pay for the entertainment offered through their wifi service. The FAs did the minimum required. Coming back to the non-entertainment system as there are no power points you are unable to charge any mobile devices not sure if any batteries can last 7 or 8 hours for the Rouge flights to Europe! AC needs to re-think the customer experience for Rouge.
2025,AF636 CDG-IAH 12/02/2015 Premium Economy. I paid 800 euros to have my wife upgraded to Premium Economy and would not advise anyone to commit such foolishness. This old 777-200 was to torn down with the space between the wall covers in the toilets filled up with filth. The seats were so hard that I decided to check what was going on and found out that the only separation between my?œderriere and the seat metal structure was a 3 mm thin foam. Finally do not believe AF fancy adds about the food served in Premium Economy. We were served exactly the same meagre and unsavory portions as in Economy. When my wife got hungry about 6 hours after the meal she was informed that she had to wait for another two hours before to get anything. I can't say much about the crew because we seldom saw them. When I introduced a complaint in the AF system I was informed that due to an unusual number of complaints I should not expect anything form them before 3 weeks. No surprise here.
2026,LAX-CDG (on A380) and CDG-TXL (on A321). Flight was delayed in Los Angeles due to incoming aircraft. In general no problem because automatic email was sent beforehand to inform passengers. But two issues: 1) They changed my ongoing flight from Paris to Berlin to a later one without telling me about it there was no communication. 2) The LAX-CDG flight caught up with the schedule so I could have made the original connecting flight but they wouldn't change my ticket back in Paris. Watched other passengers board the plane that I booked but had to wait 4 hrs at CDG for the next flight. Ground personnel refused to hand out anything not even a voucher for a drink or snack at the airport. I have been flying with AirFrance/KLM for many years now but I have to say that AF is loosing it's charm. Flight attendants on LAX-CDG didn't pay a lot of attention even though I have to say that there were always plenty of drinks and snacks.
2027,From Madrid to Palma de Mallorca. The flight was totally full. I did not have much space for my legs but flying time was only 1hour 10 mins. No free food or drinks service. 3days later I flew from Palma to Barcelona. This time was better and I had more space. Flight was on time.
2028,MAD-CUN-MAD. Both flights on time. Comfortable seats with PTV's but very limited selection. Three services of food: one meal sandwich with drinks and pizza with drinks before landing on outbound flight inbound flight I only had dinner. Crew nice on both sectors. Overall a good experience and will be happy to fly them again.
2029,"United flight was cancelled so I had to jump to AI. Flew first class and got first class treatment. Personal guide to walk me thru immigration, skip the lines and to the lounge. The lounge is excellent in Mumbai, business and the separate FC lounge. Onboard, seats are private. Service excellent and food is impressive. I have marked down for seat comfort - they lie flat but the cushion padding is poor and the seat is not comfortable. I also take a star off for movie selection - too few movies and too old. For a 15 hour flight I expect several top movies and new movies.  As a final note the new Mumbai airport, international are is impressive."
2030,"Flew Chicago to Delhi, business class, June 6 2015. Unlike most of my experience on other flights with Air India the crew disappeared after they served drinks and food. Just no service. On most other Airlines its common to see the crew walking with drinks every 15 mins or so. Well Air India did not think that's necessary. Food is average. Crew do not even bother to check if the amenities in the toilets are there."
2031,YHZ-YYZ AC619. YYZ-MCO AC1868. Air Canada Rouge: A discount airline which happily accepts full business class fares for tiny seats and no significant added value. I will never fly this airline again in business class. Cancelled my return fight and chose to fly another airline. Simple solution don't sell business class seats. Shame on Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge.
2032,Flew from Toronto Canada to Samana Dom Rep with Rouge airline (a branch of Air Canada) and the flight was great. The plane was an Airbus 319 it was modern and clean. Lots of leg room and the seats were comfortable. We had not flown with Air Canada in over 5 years and we had noticed a difference. If the chance comes up in the future to fly with them (its all about the price) we will.
2033,The usual underwhelming AF business class experience (I fly once a month on this route). AF has the nerve to advertise their new business class seat on billboards in Dakar knowing full well that they are not available on its DKR-CDG service and won't be for the foreseeable future. That's just the start. The boarding is a shambles but that's more the fault of the airport than AF probably (a quick congratulations to Dakar airport authorities on the overall organisation. Great idea to have most of the customs counters unmanned at peak time loved the chance to ponder the beauty of the building during the 30 minute wait). Once in the plane you realise that AF apparently cannot manage to get someone to vacuum clean the cabin before passengers are corralled in. Dirty and it's like that regularly! Sheer neglect and laziness. Still the crumbs and detritus on the floor are in-keeping with the ageing and shabby cabin which for reasons I'm yet to understand is invariably full. Service is haphazard and characterised mainly by its slow pace. Can't a meal be served within the first hour of a 5-hour flight? Apparently not. I was asked 3 times by three different cabin staff to endure the 'breakfast' service an hour out of Paris a 'no' each time finally got the message across. One male steward was helpful the others behaved like it was all too much trouble. Main meal mediocre wine OK. Overall glad it's not me paying the tickets.
2034,CAN-CDG in business class old style 777. Excellent trip even though flight full. Two female flight attendants the best I have ever encountered on any flight they were helpful and professional engaging in conversation with passengers. Although it was the old style seating I found it comfortable and slept well. Food was good. Air France is highly recommended.
2035,MXP-MAD aboard B737-800 and quite a pleasant experience. Departure on time plane was clean and in good condition cabin crew approach to customers was fair. Prompt baggage delivery. You need to pay for food and drinks in economy including water. The selection of refreshment is however very good and the items are reasonably priced. Seats are rather cramped.
2036,London-Madrid-Las Palmas. Significant savings being routed via Madrid and very little extra hassle. Airbus 330 looked brand new. Being short-haul there were no inflight snacks and drinks however kids were given an entertaining gift. Both flights on time. The only thing that was very strange was Air Europa's use of the original Madrid Barajas airport. It's a very disjointed terminal you get bussed around clearing immigration having hand luggage re-scanned etc. All in all I would be happy to fly with them again short haul.
2037,London to Madrid and onto Miami. I was a little nervous as it was our main holiday and we were picking up a cruise ship so didn't want problems the flights were both good and on time 1 hour delay coming home from Madrid good cabin staff clean plane but a bit old still had ash trays in seats. 767 really smooth flights would fly with them again and we had young children with us.
2038,"Flew DEL-ORD and back. Poorly maintained aircraft B777. Worn out seats. Cleanliness sub-optimal both for the cabin and in the lavatories. Staff only does the process of rushing through meal service thrice during the 15 hour flight and switch off lights rest of the time - unlike some of the good East Asian airlines, there is no one regularly going through the cabin to see if passengers need anything. One can always go back and ask for tea/coffee. There is water/juices kept in the aisle but they really don't come back to see if replenishments are needed. In-flight entertainment inadequate for such a long flight. Flight path either not switched on in time or grossly inaccurate. Safety vests hanging out from below most seats. Food quality and quantity both average. On the forward flight, the salad was spoilt and I had to return it. Only good thing is the cost - I had purchased a hugely discounted ticket - cost far less than what was available on other airlines."
2039,December 27 YYZ-MCO. January 4 MCO-YYZ. January 26 MCO-YYZ. Do not fly Rouge seats are crammed staff are not knowledgeable planes are always delayed. After you book a seat and pay for preferred seating they will send out an aircraft change notice without notifying you and you will be moved to a different seat and separated from who you are flying with.
2040,Toronto to Las Vegas. Poor overall. Cramped seats - feel sorry for those on the aisle that have to contend with a steel box on the floor. No screens on the seat backs - so no movies unless you have an ipad - and mine didn't work with it. No big loss since the movies are all antiques anyway! No power for your computer. All this at a time where it appears that Air Transat is putting in screens.
2041,"I flew business class on Air France's A380 for work. I was very excited to get the chance to fly this aircraft. I was totally underwhelmed by the business class seat. First Service was good. Wine was good. Entertainment was good. But - Business class on the A380 and the seat is not a lie flat seat! I don't think I slept 20 minutes. The pitch is 81 degrees. I'm 6'5"" - which means I barely fit in the seat when it opened up - but you find yourself sliding down the whole time."
2042,Paris CDG - Moscow Sheremetyevo. AF1844. I have never before encountered service in business class as so poor and an inflight experience as negative as I did on my recent flights: uncomfortable seats (in fact business class seat were economy class seats separated by one non-occupied seat. The entire meal was served on a single tray under a plastic film like in economy class. Entertainment were not available. The return flight Moscow-Paris on Aeroflot was significantly better!
2043,Flight from Paris-Madrid-Buenos Aires return. Paris-Madrid was provided by Air France in codeshare. Good and cheap flights almost on time departure from Madrid 1 hour delayed but made up for lost time and arrived nearly on schedule in B.A. Luggage ok (23kg) food correct free meals and snacks blanket and pillow provided staff efficient plane looked clean. 3??for the headphones 2??for travel set.
2044,Just came back from Buenos Aires via Madrid the service provided was ok apart from the seats on the long haul flight being too close together. But that's to be expected with a charter carrier. Will use it again.
2045,London-Madrid then Madrid-Havana return. All four flights were punctual two arrived early. The London- Madrid plane was new roomy with comfy leather seats. No food but it is a very short flight and no hard sell of their own food/products. The plane to Havana was much older - no TV screens had to purchase (or use own) headphones. Seats were no smaller than other economy seats. It was clean staff friendly and we were given both a meal and a snack and water at no charge. Food was acceptable. Luggage arrived fine. I would have no qualms flying Air Europa again if the schedule suited me better.
2046,I missed my connecting flight of British Airways from London Heathrow to Mumbai as my first flight of American Airlines was delayed by 2 hours. So I was put on Air India flight 130. It was delayed by 5 hours. But on boarding I just was amazed to sit in the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. I like the in-flight entertainment the seat legroom was more than enough and yes the cabin interior was pretty colorful. The food was good enough even though a bit spicy but better than what was on American Airlines. The crew were also polite. Overall experience was pretty good. All Air India needs to do is keep a tab on delays and make sure they continue this trend on other flights as well. I would surely recommend this airline especially the Dreamliner.
2047,8th May 2015 AI 603. BOM-Bangalore Executive Class. Comfortable seats savoury meal clean cabin - though signs of ageing visible and courteous staff. Overall a pleasant experience.
2048,Departure Toronto to LV Jan 19 on AC 1851. Return LV to Toronto Jan 24 on AC 1852. Over the past 10 years Air Canada has turned me into a loyal customer. They achieved this through quality aircraft crews who are customer focused and many little things such as comfortable seats the best inflight entertainment and an overall enjoyable travel experience. However I believe their attempt to compete head to head with low cost carriers and take market share from them will backfire. My Rouge flight to Las Vegas was cramped uncomfortable had no seat back entertainment system and the in-flight crew was undoubtedly frustrated by all the complaints and remarks that they were to the point of being rude. Through a 4.5 hour flight I didn't receive a visit from a flight attendant and wasn't even offered a glass of water. The worst part of the experience was the fact that I wasn't even aware this was a Rouge flight until I received an e-mail about their in-flight entertainment system. Up until the Rouge idea Air Canada had done a remarkable job of building a first class airline. I will never fly Rouge again and will even think twice about flying Air Canada in the future.
2049,YYZ-LAS-YYZ. Never again! Five hours squished in an inhumanely tiny space with our knees pressed to the seat opposite us. The flight was no better than a cattle bus. The crew dressed up in ghastly uniforms and silly hats with seemingly no idea of what they were doing let alone what they were telling the passengers during the announcements. No food unless you buy the poor quality food they sell on board and no in seat entertainment system. My wife insisted we spend the extra money and return by Westjet which we would of done had they not been sold out. We will never fly Air Canada Rouge again.
2050,Flew CDG-DTW on Delta code-shared flight. New AF seats are very uncomfortable compared to the ones before and less room for the legs. Food was OK though not particularly tasty or healthy. The flight was an hour late with no explanation and assistance at CDG (too few counters for check-in).
2051,ORY-MRS nothing special for this 1 hour flight cabin crew was smiling and friendly the captain made frequent announcements and the service was quick and professional. I definitively recommend this airline. No IFE.
2052,Flew Seoul-Vienna via Paris as well as Amsterdam because a huge delay before initial departure made me miss my Paris-Vienna flight. Ground staff in Seoul gave me a random seat - last row with no recline - despite my pre- assignment and my SkyPriority standing. The food was good and service in-flight satisfactory. KLM which flew me on the final leg delivered my luggage a day later though the efficiency in its tracking was high. The Charles de Gaulle Terminal 2F lounge was overcrowded. The return trip was satisfactory overall-meaning they need better training for their Seoul-based staff. Unpleasant and unprofessional.
2053,We flew to and from Havana and we're never going to repeat this experience! The seats were worn small and cramped and our legs hit the seat in front for 9 hours! No food except a snack while the rest was meant to be bought. On the return flight we were given the emergency exit seats except that before boarding the hostess called us and told us that those seats they were already taken and she would give us 3 row seats in business class. Well there was no business class and we had the most uncomfortable journey back I ever experienced.
2054,Paris CDG to Malaga. Old plane dirty and service started very late into the flight. Was on 6th row but was out of food when they finally came to my row. Flight crew did not seem to care about passengers. Announcements impossible to understand due to heavy Spanish accent. My luggage was lost and now 14 days later still no suitcase and airline very reluctant to assist.
2055,Flew for the first and last time. Our flight was delayed over 3 hours. We sat onboard for more than an hour without any announcements. The seats were extremely worn and uncomfortable. The floors were dirty with garbage/crumbs. Overall the planes felt old. The flight was overnight and around 3 am all the lights were turned on to serve a meal. I was overall disappointed with this airline and will not fly them again.
2056,"BOM-DEL-FRA: Both sectors were operated by 787 Dreamliner. BOM-DEL was early morning flight so they served breakfast which was warm good and filling. On the both the sectors I noticed that cabin crew are quite different. Either one is polite and second is just ""veg"" or ""non-veg"". I am sorry but we are not sitting at a street side cafe. Air India is the flag carrier of India and the crew should understand very well that they are representing our country on foreign land. DEL-FRA sector was delayed by 50 mins but crew member on my row was very polite and welcoming. Cabin crew on other side of row was just disinterested and rude. As I have said before (see below) crew does lack inter-personal skills and need professional training. It was like flying two different airlines being in same aircraft. Cabins need to be regularly cleaned. Toilets should be in perfect condition. Food quality needs to be urgently improved. Captain needs training to interact with passengers on regular period. Its high time AVOD has to be upgraded. AI has to learn a lot all of this from thier own partners TK LH and SQ."
2057,"FRA-DEL-BOM: Travelling with AI 2nd time within 3 months and I notice that the staff members are particularly lethargic and disinterested on FRA-DEL sector. Due to LH strike flight was completely booked out and ""old"" crew members of AI couldn't really handle this full flight though I have noticed that younger crew are willing and accommodating. In general crew highly lacks inter-personal skills and are strongly recommended to go through professional training. Another point where AI needs to be stringent is on cleanliness of the aircraft. These Dreamliners are only 2 years old and they are in appalling condition. Washroom glass broken and stuck with cello- tape. Luggage marks on overhead cabins cookie crumbs in seat pocket seat broken and handle is hanging. AVOD has very limited choice and urgently needs to upograde it. Indian food has won several accords world-wide and Air India is doing such injustice to Indian cuisine. They should learn from TK about it. AI needs to revamp its image in order to gain market or else they keep loosing. Next time I will fly with Jet or Turkish."
2058,I flew from Ottawa via Montreal via Zurich to New Delhi then onwards to Calcutta. The flight from New Delhi to Calcutta was a total nightmare and I really don't recommend anyone flying with Air India at all. Flight was supposed to leave in the morning but didn't leave until 11.45 am. Staff unprofessional and didn't make this flight pleasant. Inflight entertainment in limited but you should bring your own IPad to watch movies music etc. Never again Air India.
2059,"Air Canada is mediocre as it always has been but Air Canada Rouge is an absolute travesty. Usually when service and comfort drop the prices would too. Zero leg room for anyone taller than about 5'8"" and completely unhelpful customer service agents made my recent flight from Toronto to Orlando a nightmare. Fly pretty much any other airline if you have the opportunity."
2060,"CUN-YYZ: In July I booked a December trip on Air Canada and several months later we received an email saying the flight had been switched to Rouge but no refund so we paid for an Air Canada flight but got a much less comfortable Rouge flight for the same price. The seats on Rouge are very cramped: my husband's knees were hitting the seat in front and my son who is 6'4"" had to sit with his legs spread knees pointing outward. No screens in the back of the seats and if you don't have the device and app that connects to their system you can rent one to watch movies at a cost of $10! As far as staff go they seem to be trying to make Rouge more like Westjet's casual and friendly style but failed dismally on our flight. Announcements had a false perkiness to them... it sounded like they were trying to be conversational but were obviously reading (badly) from a script. The staff member doing the French announcements had an appallingly bad accent. Staff were pleasant enough but announcements very annoying."
2061,ZRH-CGD-PUF-on Jan 20 2015 and PUF-CDG-ZRH on Jan 25 2015. I must say AF mad a lot of positive progress in every way. The flight attendants and ground staff were marvellous. Friendly and always had a smile on their face. They made a drink round and served some crackers. For flights of approx. 1 hour very good. All flights were more or less on time. I will fly with them definitely again.
2062,My husband and I flew Business Class on Air France in November 2014 Paris to Melbourne and found it to be wonderful. The meals service and attention given by the staff was excellent. I would have no hesitation in flying with them again as I fly to France each year and will certainly use their airline above any other.
2063,Paris CDG to Malaga return flights on time. Efficient boarding clean and comfortable cabin. Buy on Board menu is good and the prices are correct. Flight attendants doing their job. A good experience.
2064,ORY-MAD-ORY Economy. Departure from ORY much more convenient than CDG. Both flights on Embraer 195 - clean cabin comfortable leather seats with decent legroom. I like the 2x2 seating configuration. Food and drinks for purchase - pricey but excellent coffee. Lounge in MAD fairly spacious - good drink selection but disappointing food offer with only a few nibbles. On the downside both flights were delayed by one hour with no information or apologies from the crew. Ticket fare quite competitive considering that I booked my daytrip at short notice.
2065,JFK-Madrid and Vigo-Madrid-JFK. First time I used this airline and flight attendants courteous meals great on time and flight experience good. Booked my trip through online services and I was a little sceptic about it but it turned out to be fine and I will be using them again in future.
2066,Flight from KIX-HKG in Business Class. Although I found the lounge access at KIX mediocre which is shared with Cathay Pacific the Business Class product aboard the Dreamliner with AI is comparable or exceeds standards I have had with other carriers. There were three different meal selections on that flight (the curried chicken I had was delicious) and the seat/lie flat bed was very comfortable. Be careful not to place your mobile on the bottom armrest as there is a gap and it was difficult to retrieve when I reclined and it fell between. The entertainment system was excellent with a wide variety of films and television series. Overall I was very impressed with the service and it's much improved compared to when I last flew AI eight years ago.
2067,We had three domestic flights in April 2015 (DEL-UDR-BOM-GOI) all on A319 aircraft. The aircraft interior was quite filthy on all flights. The food and drink service was ok on all flights. However the cabin crew did not pay attention to any safety related issues on any of those flights. Seats were reclined during take off and landing by a lot of passengers little kids were running over their parents laps from across seat rows during take off and cabin crew did not offer belt extensions for securing infants. Air India needs to work on their staff attitude towards safety.
2068,"My husband and I recently took AC Rouge to Cancun upgrading to premier seating. There was no business class available unless we flew through Montreal. I have been a loyal AC customer for many years - typically reaching Super Elite or Elite Status. All I can say is the flight was very disappointing. The flight attendants were inexperienced - spending far too much time in the galley giggling with one another. The premier seats were minimally better than a regular economy seat. The onboard meal options were horrible - and did not have any hot meals available although listed as a menu option. We are taking one more chance - we booked business class rouge to Cancun in February. I am hoping for the best and expecting the worst. If no better we will need to look at other airlines. And get rid of the ""hats"" - they look ridiculous."
2069,YYZ-LAS. In a word-terrible and to be avoided. I feel taken advantage of that I paid the equivalent of a business class fare for a tawdry uncomfortable and disappointing experience. The plane was an ancient 767-300 and the seat I was given in the called overcrowded Premium Rouge premium cabin was badly upholstered narrow and uncomfortably lumpy. I was unable to access any media content with my iPad because of some glitch in the wireless transmission and which was the only way one could access the IFE as on the flight there are no personal TV's. The crew were young and pleasant but embarrassingly unsophisticated and inexperienced as proven even when making scripted announcements and mangling them. Most of the time they were unsure how to make themselves heard on the cabin speaker system and their reading skills were not evident. One thing that was consistent with Air Canada's business class product is the insipidly awful catering. The breakfast was the same tired taste challenged over-salted omelette and chicken sausage Air Canada has been serving seemingly for the last decade. Sadly Rouge is now the only Air Canada carrier on the Las Vegas route unless one flies United who offer an inferior business class product but often for a lot less money than Air Canada charges even for Premium Rouge.
2070,YUL-CDG-BKK/CDG-YUL: I have never before encountered service as consistently poor and an inflight experience as negative as I did on my recent AF Flights. Nor did I think that a major airline in Europe could make US carriers look good in comparison. All of the AF equipment was distinguished by its tattiness uncomfortable seats dirt and an unpleasant cabin ambience. Positively the worst IFE I have experienced in the past 20+ years. The fact that Air France serves instant coffee sums up the quality of food service. I made the mistake of thinking that if cappuccino was on offer that it would be real. Instead I was treated to chunks of undissolved mix. Decent wine selection but that was it. One meal consisted of a sort of lamb dish. It was so overcooked it had gone to mush with what I presumed had once been vegetables. The dominant ingredient was salt. That was typical of the AF meal service. Checkin for flights at AF staffed desks was an unpleasant experience. The one dominant characteristic of most AF personnel encountered was rudeness and a disdain for the customer despite my speaking to personnel in French. On my last flight I was sent between 2 different terminals twice wasting 90 minutes on the shuttle bus doing the circuit of CDG. One clerk at the lounge in 2E-M sent me back to 2L while another sent me back to 2E-M with the monitors showing a different gate and then not showing anything. Finally once at the correct gate at 2E-M passengers were packed on to a crowded shuttle bus and brought back to 2L. Something isn't right at Air France. If one flies some of the better airlines like EVA Cathay or even Air Canada one quickly sees the differences. Air France does not give one the same confidence as they do and I felt that there was a lack of professionalism. I strongly recommend against using this airline until it sorts itself which I expect will take some time.
2071,I flew to Tokyo from Paris (AF 274) in December 2014. I really enjoyed the new Boeing 777 cabin. My seat was very comfortable and the food was very good! Flight attendants were attentive and professional. Will definitely fly again with Air France.
2072,NYC-Madrid-Lisbon for the first time in Business Class. Surprised and happy at the service and comfort of the plane. Tickets are good value for money. The only down side was the organization at the airport no respect of Business Class line and no one was reinforcing it.
2073,"Flew from Heathrow to Delhi in April this year. Cabin staff lack Professionalism. They hardly smile and seem frustrated as they have to serve passengers. There is no sense of customer service. Saw the crew sleeping during the flight instead of serving the passengers. The only question they ask ""veg or non veg"" without any ""Please"". Air India has to improve service to get competitive. The food was horrible. The toilets were disgraceful. The entertainment systems are broken and slow. Finally Air-India captains and crew need to polish up communication skills over the intercom as they have difficulty both in English and Hindi. Yes I still fly Air-India."
2074,Flight from ICN to HKG. 12 hour delay. But hotel provided. The 787 was a wonderful aircraft with plenty of legroom. Unfriendly cabin crew they never smiled and they seemed tired.
2075,"We fly Orlando to Toronto twice a year every year and until this last trip it was on Air Canada. AC is a decent airline and a relatively comfortable experience. This was our first experience with Rouge and what a huge disappointment! The seats are extremely cramped both legroom and between seats. It was a full flight. No TVs on the backs of seats but you can connect your mobile device to their limited Wi-Fi ""if"" you download the AC app. at home. My laptop didn't fit on the cramped tray table (especially with the seat in front reclined) and the music was echoing so I gave up. My android phone couldn't connect. Positives: Plane was clean and the crew had fancy bowler hats. Business class is a joke with the same seats as cattle class except with a doily and a bit more space. I would pay extra to avoid Rouge."
2076,Toronto to Punta Cana and back to Toronto. Rouge is the worst airline I have experienced. Absolutely no room and I have short legs. No entertainment system you must have an apple product in order to get movies this is so bizarre. The flight attendants were amateurs all they did was sit in the back of the plane and talk loudly during the whole trip. I will avoid any flights that use Rouge. Honestly the worst flight experience I have ever had.
2077,"HKG-CDG 12/1/2015 on B777-300ER / Despite all negative reviews on AF C-class seat (2-3-2 configurations) in their B777 my experience is quite different. I find the seat comfortable in sleeping and ""up"" position. Nice crew and excellent catering. Unfortunately the IFE system was not working (purser informed passengers before boarding) but was therefor forced to sleep and arrived fresh. My only critic is the worn out impression of the cabin. The marketing campaigns from AF are not a true reflection of the real situation of their planes this B777 looked old bad maintained and dirty."
2078,CDG-FLR on an A318. The flight was firstly late due to a technical issue with the plane. We waited on the tarmac with most of the doors open in the 3' C weather for about 45 mins. The food was atrocious. First of all is it too much of a luxury for AF to provide actual milk instead of powdered milk with their tea and coffee? The meal was a little sugary cheese something bun which was barely edible. The configuration of the plane was a little odd with small narrow and pretty uncomfortable seating with a very wide aisle. The staff were friendly enough but the IFE was non-existent. For a full service airline I thought that this flight was pretty poor. I would probably fly AF if I got a good price but for most routes you can probably get a comparable level of service on a low cost airline for much less.
2079,Venice-Madrid-Lima. Business cabin seats not clean - crumbs everywhere. Very uncomfortable seats. Two hour delay outbound one hour delay on return. During meal if you are watching a movie it is interrupted and you are forced to watch a 1 hr p.r. / ad video about Air Europa. Same on connection Madrid-Venice. Business seats are expensive - they should let you watch whatever you want. Socks that airline provide lose their ink all over your feet - very poor quality. On return flight hostesses never came through the cabin offering water - you had to get up and get it yourself. Hostesses took turns sleeping in last row of Business seats.
2080,I recently flew DEL-SYD on a 2.5 year old 787. It was in appalling condition. The aircraft was filthy. Many parts of the bathroom were held together with tape. Service was rude when rarely present. Overall a very poor experience.
2081,AI 570/571 BOM-MAA-BOM: Booked on airindia.com convenient allows seat selection. Checked in on the web as well without much trouble which allows you to go straight to the security check if you only have a carry-on bag. 570 was a relatively new 319 with good seats and pitch but 571 was an old 320 uncomfortable seating and lighting and very noisy in the front cabin until it had climbed up to cruise altitude. Standard Air India service - decent meals efficient no small talk no cheer. Both flights were nearly on time but a delay of 5-10 minutes in getting a bus to ferry us to the terminal at MAA.
2082,We flew Air Canada Rouge Airbus to Samana. It is amazing how many seats can be crammed into an old old airplane. While not tall my knees touched the back of the seat in front of me. No video you must use your laptop or tablet and you have to pay for the service. No A/C power on the plane. When I asked the staff about this their response was my computer battery should last the 4.5 hours flight. The seats in my opinion were designed to provide the least amount of padding and comfort to allow for the absolute maximum number of seats in an aircraft. I will avoid Rouge flights in future at all costs for any flight over 15 minutes. Not up to Air Canada standard.
2083,Air France for the first time EDI-CDG-DXB return. Family of four. Despite having heard negative reviews in the past about flying via CDG and not speaking French it turned out to be relatively easy. The Cabin Crew on all sectors were very pleasant and attentive. Inflight catering was to a high standard. The only issue was on the return sector when one of our three bags did not arrive at our final destination. In fairness our connection was booked by myself and was just over one hour. I received a text immediately on arrival at EDI informing me of the missing bag and also various updates during the day with regard to it's delivery status. It was delivered to our home 8 hours after our arrival. I was impressed with this level of communication. In summary we found Air France to be very good and certainly value for money. We will use them again.
2084,BKK-CDG-BKK Premium economy good seat better than economy priority check in and boarding. Food is nothing special low quality wine staff polite but nothing more than what we expect from them. One hour delay on departure 30 minutes delay on arrival in Bangkok.
2085,ORY-MAD-ORY Economy. Outbound on modern Embraer 195 - clean cabin comfortable leather seats with decent legroom. Inbound on rather old B737-800 - worn-out synthetic seats greasy windows. Both flights on-time. Informative cockpit crew smiling stewardesses but very slow service. Food and drinks for purchase - a bit pricey excellent coffee. Online check-in works only when departing Spain. Good value for money considering that I booked my daytrip at short notice.
2086,They don't offer online check in (at least not for my flight). Seats were assigned by the time you book the flight. The departure time was brought forward by 15 minutes and I got an email notice few days before travel. Check in was efficient at Gatwick. There were only few passengers in front of the queue. Boarding smooth and no rush. The plane was a E190 ??new decent leg room and the service was great. The staff wore a smile and were very patient and friendly. Flight left Gatwick 30 minutes late but arrived pretty on time.
2087,AI 933 flight from COK-SHJ on 29/03/2015. We were made to wait for 16 hrs in the airport with them changing the time every two hours and eventually told us the flight was cancelled. After a 16 hr delay they decided to shift the passengers to hotels. Food was not provided. The duty manager refused to attend the problems. Poor quality of communication. Planning not to fly Air India anymore.
2088,We travelled Air India business class in December 2014 and recently from London to Mumbai and Delhi to London. We found the plane modern and clean and the crew were delightful. The reviews we read did not resemble our experience and as regular business class passengers on other airlines we were very happy with the experience. The only critique was that the food was a bit limited and not as proficient as other airlines. The seats were spacious and the flat beds very comfortable and we will definitely be using this airline again.
2089,Flew with AF from Amsterdam to CDG transfer by bus to Orly then on to Guadeloupe PTP. Overall experience was disappointing. However I arrived on time and I had plenty of legroom due to the seat (10J). But the onboard service was nearly non-existent no response whatsoever after ringing the attendant button. Entertainment system crashed every 5 minutes. No drinks offered only with the distribution of (mediocre) food. Orly airport staff were slow rude and unfriendly.
2090,Flew with AF from Amsterdam to CDG transfer by bus to Orly then on to Guadeloupe PTP. Overall experience was disappointing. However I arrived on time and I had plenty of legroom due to the seat (10J). But the onboard service was nearly inexistent no response whatsoever after ringing the attendant button. Entertainment system crashed every 5 minutes. No drinks offered only with the distribution of (mediocre) food. Orly airport staff were slow rude and unfriendly.
2091,LPA-SVQ usual unpleasant Spanish ground staff (what's up with them?) but onboard everything fine. Pleasant FAs who carried out proper cabin checks happy to serve and delivered PAs in clear English. Aircraft elderly but cabin clean and tidy. No complaints.
2092,London to Dakar via Madrid and were pleasantly surprised with service and punctuality. We were due to return on 11 May and tried to do an online check in to get boarding passes. We succeeded to get boarding passes for Madrid to London but not the Dakar- Madrid leg. Because we knew that their website was generally dysfunctional we were resigned to show up at the airport in time for the flight. A friend suggested we call Air Europa via his friend at a travel agent. There aren't any telephone numbers shown on the site so it seemed a good idea. Only then did we discover that our flight was cancelled and that we had been transferred onto the Saturday 14th flight. Air Europa said they would not confirm this in writing but said we should just show up. As we are a 4 hour drive to the airport this is an unsettling situation.
2093,Chose Air India as it was the best schedule and best fare for non-stop service JFK-Delhi on B777. Using their website for anything but purchases and seat selection was a waste of time. Endless circles asking and re-asking for information. Calling their help center was also somewhat futile due to language issues and lack of proper training. Our outbound flight was delayed 5 hours but the airline did call and text with the news. So that was decent of them but no apology for the delay and we lost half a day in India. Seats had uncomfortable cushions and were tightly spaced. Luckily the flight was quite empty so most people had 2 or 3 seats to themselves outbound. In-flight AVOD could be good but the touch screens were not working so well and the hand held device was worthless. Flight back was delayed by nearly an hour due to late arrival. Same uncomfortable seats and slow touch screens. Service both ways was efficient limited and far from gracious. Announcements were few. All in all it was a very average flight with below average service. The only reason to use them is the low cost.
2094,Flew from Newcastle to Paris extremely large passenger took over most of my seat as flight was full no alternative but to endure. Baggage never reached connecting flight and was missing for five days which was half of my holiday. Never again will I fly with Air France.
2095,Recently flew LHR to CCS (via CDG) on Air France - Business Class. Seat reservations made at time of booking had been changed when I checked in online 24 hours before the flights. No explanation offered. I found seat 2A on outbound leg much more comfortable than seat 4E on return leg. Although on a 10 hour flight with a leading European Airline one would expect a flat bed AF do not offer this on the Paris / Caracas route. On the way out my baggage missed the connection in Paris and it took more than 2 days for AF to get it to me. No apology no explanation no keeping me informed. On way back delay of over three hours. Air France Business Class lounge in Caracas is atrocious worst I have seen. IFE did not work for the first 90 minutes of the flight despite the valiant efforts of the Purser.
2096,LGW- Madrid-Havana return. Check in smooth although got growled at somewhat when asking for an upgrade as on honeymoon. Cabin Staff friendly and efficient. Food no better or worse than other airlines (included in the long haul stretch not the LGW- Madrid part). In-flight entertainment first movie in Spanish only. All in all no problems at all.
2097,London Gatwick-Madrid Barajas-Buenos Aires return. All flights on time check in efficient and general customer service good. Food provided on long haul crossing was edible if not desirable. Stewards were sullen but not unhelpful and inflight entertainment on the return flight was fantastic though not working properly on the way out. Fantastic value for money and though most certainly not a 5* airline the best deal for a Europe-South America.
2098,MAD-ATH. Air Europe could easily be named esyjet in terms of inflight service however check in quite efficient. Nothing complimentary on flight got myself sandwich + coke for EUR7 quite reasonable. Will fly again if it is a bargain otherwise AF or LH.
2099,I flew AI from Newark to Mumbai and it was 100% better than my flight on United. Seats were much comfortable and spacious than other airlines. AI144 was right on time from Newark and I didn't know its a Star Alliance member. I landed 30 mins before schedule to Mumbai and liked the food ambiance and service on board. Many people have wrong perceptions about AI but hope it improves its PR department.
2100,Took flight 83 from San Francisco to Paris. One of the worst 11 hour flights ever. Got to my seat to find all of the electronics did not work. Notified staff before takeoff. There seemed to be some power to the electronics yet nothing worked. No light no music no monitor not even the attendant call button. I was told they could somehow reboot the system associated with my seat shortly after takeoff. After a couple attempts to reboot and two hours trying to get the crew's focus on the matter I was finally told that they would not be able to get the electronics of my seat working. They offered me magazines which is completely useless considering they dim the cabin lights and I had no light of my own which worked. So I got to sit in the dark and 11 hours of flight going out of my mind with boredom. What makes it worse is knowing that this airline would not have known that my electrionoc were not functioning properly before the flight boarded. Not only did it limit me on my ability to view the safety video before the flight started but it also brings into question why the systems did not work in the first place. The plane seemed fairly new and if the problems associated my electronics was not a simple rebooting of my system according to the crew then what was it that cause all of the systems around my seat to fail?
2101,LHR-CDG-LYS. Got assigned seat 3A in Premium Eco on LHR-CDG leg which is always nice and seems to happen to me quite often on this route. It doesn't make much of a difference on such a short flight - even though you do get better food - but sitting at the front of the aircraft makes the boarding/ disembarking process a breeze. Transfer between to 2E and 2F at CDG can be a bit of a hassle but both terminals are new and relatively easy to navigate. Nothing exceptional on CDG-LYS leg but an overall pleasant experience.
2102,JFK in business class to Madrid on to Barcelona and back. Seats were not great service was good. Food was average and entertainment TV service was very poor. I was delayed by airport transfer 'Aero city' in reaching to the airport and I was not only not allowed to board and I had to buy one more ticket at a premium but not only was charged for the ticket to go to Madrid but was charged 200 for the connecting flight which I did not miss excuse given was since I missed one leg of my flight I will have to rebook the other one but I was reaching Madrid in time to get my next connection.
2103,We flew Air Europa from Barcelona to Madrid. The online purchase and seat selection were flawless check in and baggage drop efficient and no line. Because I am a Delta Platinum I was allowed SkyTeam boarding with the business class passengers. Boeing 737-800 was fairly new seating all leather and in perfect condition. Although they charged 2.50 euros for a diet coke service was otherwise good. A great flight overall.
2104,Flew PVG-DEL return (and Delhi to Kochi return) in economy. Flight from Shanghai was very smooth super empty Dreamliner left on time very comfortable. The Delhi to Kochi flight was very delayed but otherwise fine. The DEL-PVG leg was a disaster. We took off on time and made very good time there was a storm over Shanghai so we circled twice before landing at an airport about two hours away. Totally understandable these things happen. But we were then held on the tarmac for more than 4 hours with no water and with two of the bathrooms out of order. We got very little information and crew did not push for our release. I understand the Chinese ground staff just didn't come but Air India has to fight for its passengers rights - more than 4 hours with no food or water! We could not use the bathroom! The plane was beginning to smell. This was so poorly handled and has really put me off Air India.
2105,I flew Air from Sydney to Delhi and return because it was a non stop flight. On entering the aircraft it looked old and I found that my touch screen did not work. The toilets were disgusting smelt and were stained. Some panels were hanging loose. The floor was awash. On return the aircraft looked newer but the toilets were still disgraceful. I had to fly via Melbourne which was a pain in the neck as we had to disembark in Melbourne and go through a stringent security check again. On take off the cabin crew did not do a safety check of passengers and we took off with one passenger asleep across three seats unrestrained. One passenger had tray table down and that was what I could see from my seat. The cabin crew avoided eye contact at all times. During the long overnight flight from Delhi children were allowed to run amok. Food mediocre. Would never use again.
2106,HKG-CDG Flight 185. FA's were particularly friendly and helpful. Food and drinks were high standard as usual. Main issues: seat was comfortable enough but lacks the essential for a business class seat: horizontal lie-flat. More privacy would be appreciated as well and there is not enough personal storage room. The cabin was brand new and features the new 2-2-2 seats plan far more pleasant than the 777 2-3-2 configuration. Use of the inflight entertainment system is not really easy and it takes time to navigate through categories and pick a movie. Options are nonetheless plentiful with a good selection of English and French-speaking blockbusters. The Qantas lounge in HKG is definitely not up to the usual AF service in the company lounges around the world. AF should definitely find another partner to accommodate its priority passengers. Overall a very smooth flight which got AF back into my favorite airlines list.
2107,LAX-CDG. After reading so many bad reviews for the AF Premium Economy product I was eager to try it out for myself. If you are like me the thing you hate most about economy is having the person in front of you recline all the way in your lap for the duration of an 11 hour flight. So with that said having shell style seats is very exciting even if they don't recline in the traditional sense. Upon entering the A380 PE economy cabin I could tell right away I would enjoy the experience. The dedicated cabin is small and cozy and the seat itself has tons of room compared to any economy seat. Do not listen to the reviews on here that say the seats are cramped because it's just not true. I have long gangley legs and I could stretch them all the way out to the foot rest under the seat in front of me. It's basically a mini business class seat and compared to other premium economy products out there that cost twice as much (Virgin Atlantic) it is well worth the price of admission. I feel like a lot of the negativity comes from people who expect business class for the extra money they are paying even though it's a quarter of the price. The food is nothing special and I agree that the bottom portion of the seat could use some extra padding. Service was great and the stewards came immediately after pushing the call button. As for the non traditional recline of the seat I found it more comfortable then the normal seat back legs sitting position of economy. The trick is to make sure you extend the calf rest and foot rest so your body is being supported in the diagonal position. Again I feel like other fliers are either use to their economy habitat and or expect lay flat seats that they didn't pay for. As I said before not having the person in front of you laying in your lap the entire flight is heaven on earth which is still a problem on many PE products. Please take it from me a rational realistic aviation aficionado. I speak the truth in all my reviews and would not hesitate to let you know my dissatisfaction if there were any.
2108,"ORY-PTP - I took Air France for my journey to the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. The flight a Boeing 777-300ER was on time clean and very comfortable the crew was very welcoming and friendly. The meal was excellent (I have chosen Air France special meal ""Lenotre"") and the entertainment very rich - with French and international programmes. This 8 hour flight was a great experience!"
2109,London to Cuba. We were delayed for an 1.5hrs going out and 3 hrs on the way back. The staff were terrible very poor at communicating and didn't know what was going on. The plane looked pretty tired and seats are pretty uncomfortable (although decent legroom). On the way back Air Europa lost our luggage (we changed at Madrid which was rushed as we were late). The baggage service sorted it out and sent it on to us within 24 hours. Overall Air Europa are cheap but it shows.
2110,LGW-MAD-HAV return. Check-in at Gatwick very quick and easy. Flights on time. Personal IFE system outbound to Havana - have to pay for earphones but i-pod ones work just as well. Different aircraft on return so just a screen at the front of the cabin but as a night flight wasn't too bothered. Food not great but edible.
2111,"Buenos Aires-LGW. Due to cancelled flight with another airline and missed connection at Buenos Aires we had no alternative but to get back to the UK with Air Europa. Had awful seats 27G/H no window and 24"" opposite the toilet. When we arrived onboard there was a notice saying Toilet Out of Order. Phew - at least we won't be bothered by people visiting the loo for a 13 hr flight! How wrong I was. Just before take off a member of staff took down the sign and promptly placed it on the washbasin. In other words the toilet was operable but there was no water to wash hands! The inflight entertainment system was not working so I had to twiddle my thumbs for the whole journey. To occupy my mind I worked out that the number of visits paid to the toilet without water was between 275-300 times! I felt disgusted that people would use a toilet without washing facilities. This should have been closed for health & safety reasons. I mentioned it to the Spanish steward but he didn't think too much about it. I asked why there was no hand antiseptic (like they use in hospitals) but he said ""because of no water""! He did not understand what this gel was. One couple even changed their baby's nappy in the toilet. The seats felt uncomfortable with a lack of tilt. The only good thing about the whole flight was the coffee."
2112,Chicago (ORD) to Delhi (DEL). February 2015. I booked ticket on website and went to the airport with check-in and carry-on bag. I got a surprise at the counter the person told that I can carry only 4 Kg carry-on baggage. This was unexpected. Finally moved some luggage from one bag to other on airport and took receipts of the bag. Onboard: The crew served snacks and water but I needed more water I was searching for crew but couldn't find them. The crew returned after some time and served more food and drinks. On a 14 hours non-stop flight this should be their practice. Food was good - in taste and quantity. Entertainment was okay. Seat was comfortable with enough legroom a very important thing for 14hr non stop flight. What didn't work: 1 or 2 restrooms ran out of tissues towards the end of the journey. Though it was a long journey crew should have done something to improve this. Overall: Apart from the restroom issue I didn't feel that anything went wrong. Overall flight was a very good experience with plenty of foods drinks good seating okay entertainment.
2113,August 29 from SÃ£o Paulo to Paris. Boeing 777-300 - (F-GSQI). Ticket was purchased directly on the website on May 2. However seat assignment was not permitted as long as the passenger makes the check in online 30 hours prior the departure. I definitely can't say that I agree with such procedure but it's a way to force passengers to do their own check in. Online check-in went fine but I was previously informed by the AF reservation agent that all seats would be available once the system was charged but definitely this was untrue. Anyhow I got seats together for myself and my parents. Once onboard the aircraft was with an issue with the air-conditioning system. So the plane was hot just like a sauna. Only when the main door was closed and the engines started working fortunately we got fresh air. Flight was completely full. As soon as we took off crew started the inflight service. Eyeshade and earphones were personally distributed which was a nice touch. Right after welcome drink which included champagne and a small bag of salty snacks were offered. My vegetarian option was delivered but the main dish was cold. During the flight drinks ice cream and small sandwiches were available in both galleys. Prior to our arrival hot breakfast was served. At the carousel our baggage took a life to be delivered.
2114,CDG-Miami (round trip). On CDG-MIA flight we had a lovely staff who seemed happy to serve passengers. In return the crew seemed so tired. Some didn't say a word to passengers and others yawned. Air France product has fallen a lot in recent years and it's sad to see such a different quality between the 2 flights.
2115,CDG-MIA. Cabin staff during almost an 10 hours flight appeared 2 times. Snacks during flight are boring and only available in 1 pantry in the economy class on a A380. Toilets looked horrible and we're not cleaned. Seats are old and in our row of 3 2 had technical problems. Overall value for money as flying Air France is cheap however I would not consider to buy a ticket at a regular fare.
2116,The staff at JFK need to be re-trained a bit in customer relations but onboard treated with professionalism service as good or better than most US airlines. Food in economy was good and it came with free wine or beer. Ground staff in Spain was great.
2117,Regular flyer on CDG-VLC and ORY-PMI. Air Europa offers good value for money even when booking at short notice. All flights on-time so far seat is assigned at check-in. Informative cockpit crew friendly and smiling stewardesses. Food and drinks for purchase - reasonable prices excellent coffee. On the downside the B737-800 are showing their age - tight seat pitch worn-out seats greasy and dirty windows. Furthermore trying to use online check-in often results in an error message or technical problem. I prefer Air Europa to Iberia for crew friendliness and cheaper fares.
2118,The flight was on time to and from Rome food was good plane was decent. The crew was helpful and polite.
2119,"Flew DEL-BOM-DEL on A321 both ways (AI865 and AI888) and was very happy with the AI experience: flights on time cabins relatively clean with the IFE working good hot meals provided both ways and - contrary to some previous reviews - the cabin crews were very good. On BOM-DEL sector we loved the chicken and after telling this to a female flight attendant she soon came back with more chicken and was very happy to serve us more. Absolutely delightful! However the ""signature coffee"" on AI remains very weak year after year but all the rest was excellent on these two domestic flights. Maybe the competition on this trunk route including the new Vistara Airlines keeps Air India alert and they have to put some extra effort to keep their loyal customers coming back."
2120,"AI984 GOI-BOM 9 March and AI342 BOM-SIN on 10 March. Check in was quick as I had arrived at the airport early. Both flights left on time. The first flight was short and uneventful/unremarkable. The crew on the second flight were friendly and helpful responding to passengers with a genuinely caring attitude. Meals served and cleared quickly enabling passengers to get some shut eye on this overnight flight. Kebabs served with cut fruit and dessert for the midnight ""snack"". All in all a good experience."
2121,Traveled on TRV-SHJ sector during January 2015. The aircraft operated was an Airbus A320. Check in was smooth and hassle free. The inbound aircraft was delayed from MAA (as its a MAA-TRV-SHJ flight) and the departure hence got delayed for around 45 minutes. Frisking by Air India group security was done prior to boarding. The interior seats were comfortable and clean. The attitude of the cabin crew as usually complained was poor. One of the aged crew was serving food even without asking whether non-veg or veg. Few of the passengers including myself had to ask her to change as she simply gave the non veg without asking.It seemed they ran out of veg meals. Flight managed to land 30 minutes late at Sharjah and the baggage delivery was prompt as well. Overall experience was good.
2122,AF1653 Kiev to Paris 23/11/2014 on Airbus A319. Check-in was efficient but that's all that I liked about the flight. I've never experienced before such an arrogant and frigid crew as on this flight. Crew did not do anything during the first two hours of the flight. They were chatting for two hours! After two hours of chatting with each other reading newspapers playing games on their phones and drinking coffee they decided to serve the passengers. Coffee or tea and a very small croissant were served. I expected a bit more on a flight of over three hours. After serving they were gone and I haven't seen them again. Seats were horrible in comparison to my outbound flight with KLM. The announcements were very difficult to understand. And of course they lost my baggage. After 5 days I could collect my baggage at the airport. I'll never ever in my life fly Air France again and I will never recommend them to anyone else!
2123,AF BUD-CDG-HKG 4 Nov 2014. BUD-CDG on A321. Uneventful flight however seating on board AFs A321 fleet is not too comfortable. Pitch and width quite tight. Connection in CDG (late evening) a breeze - hardly any other passengers at passport control did not have to go through security again. CDG-HKG an A380. Upper deck economy seating feels much more private - and the boarding process is usually quicker as you get to join a separate line for upper deck (only 8 rows). Onboard service good nice meals for ecoonomy (and even a hot breakfast). bars are set up on both decks with drinks and snacks (ice cream is a nice touch). Seats on AF's A380 are quite spacious - more width than Emirates and ample pitch. Easily one of the best longhaul economy experiences. The IFE is usable but not top- notch (anymore) - the responsiveness of the screen is annoying. The selection of movies and TV shows is not very large but okay. All in all a nice experience at a very competitive price.
2124,"CDG-KL travelled long haul with Air France for the first time. Had heard that the Premium Economy seats were uncomfortable but that turned out to be an understatement. They were as hard as park benches. I had to resort to scrounging cushions from other seats to sit on - not worth the price premium. Leg room was OK and could extend my legs fully under seat in front (I'm 62""). The food was OK but the service appalling. No attempt was made to deliver an aperitif before the food but rather had to be requested at the same time. Took a good 45 minutes for them to come and clear away the plates with all the attendant issues of having it left there on the tray. No offers of digestif despite being listed on the menu. During the cabin darkness period was not approached a single time to be offered a drink hot flannel etc. The only time I saw crew during this time was when I got up to walk front to back of the plane and discovered a couple of them in the galley reading magazines. All in all doesn't come anywhere near Emirates or Singapore so would actively look to avoid in future for long haul."
2125,"Booked flights MAN-CDG-ATL and return 9 months ago before our trip we reserved seats online as soon as we were allowed. On checking a few days before our departure I discovered the seat reservations had been cancelled by AF. Had to phone AF Heathrow who explained it was due to ""operational needs"" but he reserved us middle of the plane seats in both directions as no window seats available on reaching CDG I asked for an explanation and was told it was a problem with Delta (flight was codeshare). On the flight despite asking for the meat option meal all we could get was the vegetarian option which was just about edible-we were 25 rows from the back. The seats were not comfortable to begin with so you can imagine how we felt after a 9 hour flight."
2126,Paris to Madrid economy class aircraft arrived with 1h 45 hour delay at Paris to pick up passengers then we were rushed into the aircraft to avoid the 2 hour delay penalty. Once seated it took an extra 45 minutes to take off as the pilot said it did not have clearance from Madrid control tower. Why rushing the passengers into the airplane then? In the end we landed with almost 3 hour delay no compensation food or drink offered during the flight staff extremely unpleasant and unprofessional chatting loudly between themselves at the back of the plane. The aircraft was dirty it really felt like a very poor airline I would not recommend it at all.
2127,A very poor airline which offers poor value for money and would certainly not recommend. London-Gatwick to Madrid and back. Check-in is very slow with massive queues at the airport. Boarding ok but could have been much more organised. Their aircraft are a right mess and showing their age very uncomfortable even for a short flight. The cabin crew are not at all good.
2128,Buenos Aires-Madrid. The original ticket was through Madrid to Rome and I wanted to disembark in Madrid instead of going all the way to Rome for which they charged me EUR 70 but it took them 40 minutes at the check-in to execute it. Nearly missed the flight. The service onboard was very bad and inattentive. Most of ground and onboard staff speaks Spanish and poor English. I had the feeling throughout that they are barely on top of things they are doing so any request a bit out of ordinary causes problems. I had no major issues but overall it was the worst flight I ever had.
2129,"FRA-DEL/DEL-KAT/KAT-DEL-FRA - Were told at check-in in FRA that there was a delay of 1 hour but gate was closed at scheduled time! Waiting time of one full hour in FRA before taking off! No service or drinks for 4 hours during flight. Breakfast served last minute. Crew on all legs not really interested in customer and service. Dreamliner with lot of space and good fresh air full flat beds really comfortable. Food ok but cheese platter served after dessert. Champagne before taking off but no wine offered on return-flight. Flight to Kathmandu and back: time change and delayed return for 1.5 hrs. Service pathetic no smile the only question was ""veg or non veg"" without any ""please"". Air India has to improve service to get competitive."
2130,Chennai-Dubai and Dubai-Mumbai a couple of months ago. Old A-321 aircraft with faded seats and no inflight entertainment system. Surly cabin crew who had a feeling that they were doing a favor to passengers. On the Chennai-Dubai sector the passenger sitting in front of me asked for an extra can of beer during dinner only to be roughly ticked off by the cabin crew. The reason given was that they only serve one can of beer per passenger. I have flown hundreds of miles on various airlines but this is the first time that I am hearing such a ridiculous explanation. With this kind of flight experience it is no wonder that most of the traffic on the Gulf routes from India deviates towards the Middle Eastern carriers.
2131,JFK-CDG-AMS. Check in at JFK - friendly staff but boarding announcements not clear and confusing (A380). Premium Economy bought at airport - although comfortable I find the price is not truly value for money. Food and staff good to excellent. Hassle free transfer at CDG including entering Schengen and additional security check.
2132,London - Rio de Janeiro via Paris A330-200. Good flights overall. I paid Â£50 for an exit row seat one way at the time of booking which I think was good value on a Â£500 return flight and the configuration of 2-4-2 is good as it means only ever one person to climb over regardless of seat position. My baggage didn't make it to Rio although the connection was tight and they were punctual with delivery in Rio the day after. Food onboard was pretty good although IFE left a bit to be desired - not all that much choice available. Overall the experience was good and at around Â£490 at the cheaper end for Europe to Brazil - Paris CDG is a ridiculous airport to transfer through. It's a huge maze and you do security again despite having just done it in London 45 min before.
2133,Oct 23 AF SFO-CDG-NCE. Economy - reserved seats on SFO-CDG in advance. Chose seats on top level of A380 as there's less movement around the cabin compared to downstairs. FA's were friendly. Food average but was given champagne upon asking. Discovered the 'bar' upon going to the back of the plane to the toilets. Sweets ice cream soft drinks. They don't wait on people much outside of the organized mealtimes but it doesn't bother me to get up and fetch a drink as it's an opportunity to stretch my legs. Boarding at SFO was quick as there were several airbridges and we were boarded first. The problem came from the transfer at CDG. AF changed our flight to Nice because SFO-CDG was leaving later (due to delayed arrival) except they booked us on a flight out from Orly the other side of Paris. The check-in guy at SFO airport managed to change us to a flight out of CDG. However the flight SFO-CDG caught up on the delay and arrived on time in CDG so we then had to queue at the transfer desk to get back on our original flight CDG to Nice! We were dubious about our baggage making the transfer - but it did! AF doesn't match some other airlines but the ticket was cheaper so I'm not complaining. I liked the A380. The CDG-NCE was uneventful with a drink and a packet of biscuits - surely they could do better than that?
2134,LA to Amsterdam via KLM and yesterday October 21 2014 returned from Paris to LA on their partner Air France [AF]. I received an email ahead of time from AF regarding online check in only to be informed I needed a visa or green card and could not check in except at the airport. We arrived 3 hours ahead of departure time went to obtain boarding passes and check in our one bag each only to find it was all done electronically. There were long lines in front of each machine with much confusion and unfamiliarity with the how to navigate the process. One in front of us took at least 10 minutes to complete the process. After 25 minutes we entered another long line to drop off our check in bags which took another 15-20 minutes. At no point were our carry-on bags weighed as they were with KLM. We then walked about 10 minutes to enter the longest line yet which was for passport control and after few minutes were ?œrandomly??selected to go to another line for carry on weight and size control. We observed bags being shoved into a steel frame for sizing. Additionally they added purses and shoulder bags to the total weight calculation which easily put most over the limit of 12 kg. The handlers then slapped a large red AF tag on the bag marked up the boarding pass and sent us back to the baggage area. We returned to the baggage area and discovered the fee for each bag was 70 Euros about $100. When we explained this could have been avoided if our carry-ons were weighed at the same time as our check in as we could have redistributed some items. In the end we had to check in one additional bag. We arrived at our gate as the plane was boarding. While doing so we observed many passengers with 3 carryon bags. We learned many lessons not the least of which is we will not fly AF again.
2135,Paris to Lima in Business because of their unbeatable price and pleasantly surprised by the level of service. CDG-MAD a codeshare by Air France whose Business Class service is below all standards just normal economy. Business lounge in Madrid is very basic but onboard young and cheerful crew who were attentive and smiling. Excellent meals with Spanish flavours and some of their best wines. Comfortable reclining seats allowed a nice sleep. Similarly pleasant experience on the return flight.
2136,Barcelona Miami-Barcelona. Based on a decent experience a year ago flying to Argentina decided to fly them again. Now I regret it. BCN-MIA was uneventful; nothing worth mentioning except confirming what others have already written about their old B767s (old no flight entertainment tight seats etc) - crew did smile at times which made me think that they make an effort to differentiate themselves from Iberia. Flight back a complete nightmare: Completely incompetent check-in staff at MIA airport 1.5 hr delay in Miami late boarding and departure without explanation. Thirsty and hungry passengers had to wait about an additional 1.5hrs after take off to have dinner served as crew were busy with duty free sales. By landing 1 hour late in Madrid a significant portion of passengers lost their connections. About 20 of us were connecting to Barcelona and when arriving to passport control section we were told we needed to pick our baggage (they were supposed to go directly to Barcelona?). With tons of baggage connecting passengers had to stroll through Terminal buildings 1 and 2. When we finally arrived at the customer service center in T2 an airline employee got us all BCN passengers together and told us everything was prepared for us to continue our journey with local low cost carrier Vueling since their next flight wouldn't leave until 9pm. At first this seemed like a decent solution but when I asked her if Vueling would accept our 2+ baggages (based on ticket allowance travelling to US) she hesitated and rushed to call Vueling. When she came back she said the answer was no - since Vueling accepted 1 baggage/20k per person and that either we paid our baggage excess with Vueling or we fly with them 5hrs later. Frustrated we took our chances and gave it a shot at Vueling who thankfully checked in the totality of our baggage without charges and who brought us back home 5 hours later than expected. Next time I will be very willing to pay 100 EUR more to travel with other carriers.
2137,Flew Chennai-Mumbai. Aircraft was an old A-319 still sporting the old Indian colors. Faded but clean interiors. Energetic cabin crew. Hot meal served on board. They ran out non-veg selection after a while and when queried by one of the passengers the answer given was that they had loaded more veg meals with the assumption that not many people would take non-veg on a Thu. Overall Air India is a cheap option to fly from point to point if one is not bothered about in-flight service and entertainment.
2138,LHR to SYD via Delhi. Three legs in 687 and final leg in 777. Generally satisfactory but much room for improvement. Lie flat seats on all flights. Cabin crew good. All flights late on take off and landing which seems common with AI. Catering standards poor compared with competitors and lacks consistency. Overall flights satisfactory given the low price but AI need to improve to compare with better airlines.
2139,LHR to Melbourne via Delhi. Flights were on time. Comfortable flat beds and attentive service especially on the Delhi to Melbourne leg (crew were a bit less energetic on the first leg). Food was fine. I liked the rather retro cocktail trolley before dinner. Air India is not up there with the very best and there are far fewer frills (no real amenity kit at all and food presentation isn't so polished). But the fare was also a lot less I had a flat bed all the way to Australia and the crew on the second leg were really trying hard and were very sweet. I have no complaints.
2140,Flew AI 381 (787 Dreamliner) SIN - DEL on 25 Dec 14 the brand new dreamliner was excellent with flat bed seats crew were polite and attentive breakfast served on board was excellent. Air India should enhance their inflight entertainment system with more options of latest movies in it I would definitely recommend and use Air India again in future.
2141,AF76 to Papeete Tahiti on 10/7. Eight hour flight arrived at 5:10 AM. Required check-in in Los Angeles on transfer from Delta. No indication of location of Air France Counters outside of International Terminal. Sky Priority check-in very hectic so much that we just made it to the plane as they were boarding. Flight was okay except my traveling companion and I were separated in our seat assignments as were other travelers and the flight attendants managed to re-seat everyone except us - French speakers first.
2142,I travel frequently with Air France to Brazil and I am always impressed with the service I get and the friendly air crew. They speak the language of the country that they fly to as well as English and their own French. They are quick to attend offer champagne as an aperitif wine with your food and also a digestive cognac after they have collected your empty food tray. It's always been a pleasure flying with them.
2143,My flight was from Atlanta to CDG-Paris on Saturday Oct 11th. I will avoid this airline in the future due to the following: 1) No special meal option-no gluten free vegetarian peanut allergy diabetic etc. meals available 2) Lazy unfriendly flight attendants. Every time there was a tiny bit of minor turbulence they flipped the seat belt light and plopped in the flight attendant seat strapped in and took a break. This happened frequently. I sat near the galley and saw them eating ice cream cake feet propped up. I don't think they ever offered water or any types of beverage during the flight. Completely awful staff. 3) Plane was ragged looking and my TV did not function properly. FA said there was nothing he could do. Did not give one care about it.
2144,For the very first time I flew from JFK to CDG in business class. The cabin had been newly remodelled and it was great. It was the first time that comfort was competing with the companies from the gulf area. It was a piece of luck for most 777 have not been remodeled yet. Staff food drinks entertainment everything was perfect. I just pity all those who pay the same amount but do not have the same comfort.
2145,"JFK to Madrid with connection to Venice return via same cities. Plane took off about 2 hours late from JFK but arrived on time with the benefit of a strong tailwind. No explanation for delay provided but once on the ground in Madrid the cabin attendant gave the typical insincere apology for ""any inconvenience."" The next leg to Venice on time - the only flight segment that was timely. The return to Madrid left Venice about 1.5 hours late and arrived Madrid late by same amount. Madrid to JFK pushed back more than 2 hours late and then immediately halted for a half hour more while mechanics were called on board to fix the air conditioning. We deplaned at JFK 3 hrs late. Again the cabin attendant gave a rote ""apology"" but no explanation for the delay. Air Europa has no info on its rather primitive web site to inform whether flights are on time or delayed. Delays aside the cabin staff were polite animated and professional except that curiously no one claimed to know anything about the cause of the various delays encountered. This is a Spanish airline and most of the passengers seemed to be Hispanic. Important announcements were given in both Spanish and English but the message was often delivered in heavily accented English. The pilots said little particularly avoiding any discussion of delays. I suspect delays are too sensitive a subject for AE to discuss in a forthright fashion. Check the airline's on time record before buying tickets as I wish I had. Avoid this airline if making onward connections is a critical concern. Passenger comfort in Economy was at the lower end of tolerable. I don't travel enough to make a comparison with other airlines but I'd venture that few airlines afford the economy passenger less seating room than Air Europa if indeed that were even possible. For a relatively new A330-200 the seats didn't return to the upright position without some assistance. Stowed baggage was routed through to the end destinations and arrived without problem. Be careful though at the JFK we were charge $50 for an overweight bag. Next time I'll use something more accurate than the bathroom scale. Food and beverage service were OK. One observation: as the low price leader it's surprising AE has not sought to leverage this advantage by more zealous attention to managing flight delays. If so I would have given higher marks for value. For example they might start by acknowledging a problem exists and that saying nothing won't make it go away. I wish AE good luck but next time I'll pay up to choose a carrier with a better on time record a more informative web site and more seating room."
2146,MAD-ORY-MAD. Air Europa no longer give access to VIP Lounge to SkyTeam Elite Plus members (Flying Blue Gold Card as well as Platinum) which was a quite negative experience. Boarding was chaotic - ground staff announce the boarding stating boarding priorities (families with children elite plus members then passengers from rows 15 to 30 and then rest of passengers). At this time the queue becomes unmanageable everyone moves without knowing the priority of other (why not create separate lines like AF and IB do). Catering service as in low cost companies (paid) no chance to get emergency exit as they charge like in low cost airlines. Special thanks to Flying Members announced on PA but at this time I really felt that they don't really care about FB members.
2147,London Gatwick - Madrid - Tenerife North they had the cheapest fare on the route. I checked in with no problems at Gatwick but as soon as I got through security I saw that my flight was delayed by 1.5 hours - could have been communicated at check in. This meant that I would miss my connection. Onboard crew apologised for the delay (which was due to the aircraft waiting for passengers transferring from a delayed Buenos Aires flight - but lots of people on my flight were transferring across Spain and to Caracas and missed their flights.) The seats were comfortable and crew very friendly. On arrival in Madrid people were waiting for us to give new boarding passes. I was put in business class on a Spanair flight 2 hours later and Air Europa paid for a meal and to use their lounge. To top things off Tenerife North was closed due to bad weather and we had to divert to the south airport. All in all it was all very annoying and a long day but Air Europa dealt with everything well and as best as they could.
2148,Flight 8763 27th December. Flew Munich-Delhi in December in a Dreamliner. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of AI. Very efficient staff and overall quality for money.
2149,AI143 from CDG to DEL. Departure on time. 787 service with IFE in economy although with limited choice. Choice of 3 entrees (Fish Chicken Vegetarian). Nice and very efficient cabin crew. Overall a good night flight.
2150,"Flew DEL-BOM-GOI-MAA-DEL on 4th and 8th January 2015. DEL-BOM-GOI was the best of the lot with great food and on- time performance. Return journey was pretty pathetic as our flight from GOI got delayed due to ""technical"" failures which the check-in personnel were reluctant to tell about. Missed our return connection from MAA in the morning but the airline was kind enough to rebook us in an evening flight and gave vouchers for lunch given by some cold faces in the airport. MAA-DEL was delayed due to weather in DEL. The only flipside in all the three journeys was the basic IFE and some tasteless food in GOI-MAA and MAA-DEL flights. Crews were decent and had served with smile though."
2151,AI 675 Mumbai - Kolkata on 17th January 2015. The aircraft an A320 was in excellent condition. It was spotless and the seats were very clean and so was the entire cabin. The crew were excellent always smiling and helping the guests. The seats provided extreme comfort with ample leg space. The only suggestion that comes to my mind is AI should make sure that they change the menu because the last time I flew AI 675 in Nov' 2014 the same breakfast was served (Non Veg). The flight was extremely comfortable. The return leg was on 23rd January 2015 (AI 775). The flight was delayed by about 90 minutes however I have no complaints because AI kept informing me through regular calls and texts about the exact status. The aircraft used in this leg was an old A319. The seats were torn and in some cases even the back rest was not upto the mark. I don't understand if AI can use their 787s in other domestic routes why not in the BOM-CCU sector? If not then why can't the A319s be replaced with the A320s which provide much better comfort. This is just a suggestion as I love flying AI. I would also like to appreciate the fact that in spite of the flight being delayed by 0 minutes we were served dinner on board. The dinner was excellent. Last but not the least I'd like to request AI to please reintroduce the entertainment system for the domestic sectors also so that we can enjoy the flight even more.
2152,I flew CDG-JFK on October 15th on AF008 and flew back on October 16th on AF009. The plane a B777-200ER had the new business class configuration (1-2-1). This new business class is comparable to the very best standards. The seat is comfortable in any position. The IFE is nice with a wide screen and a lot of selection. On these two flights the cabin crew was very professional and friendly too. The food was very good westbound so-so eastbound. Wine selection just OK for a French airline. Compare to the current (and very poor) business class what a change!
2153,"Not-so-premium: shabby equipment poor food uncomfortable seat. I flew Premium Economy from CDG to JFK on the return trip from France. I expected an upgraded level of service equal to or greater than Economy Comfort on Delta. The hard shell seat was extremely uncomfortable and the ""recline"" (more a sliding function) did not work. Entertainment options were limited and dated. The food was exactly the same as economy - a mush of potatoes and vegetables with a side of chicken in cheese sauce. The only difference was the addition of an unappetizing brown pate. The second meal service was a stale roll and some yoghurt. The price is outrageous for the level of service offered. I hope Air France will entirely rethink this class of service."
2154,JFK-CDG-VIE. The AF Prem Econ seats are as described elsewhere uncomfortable. They weren't designed for sleep. Our return flight from CDG to JFK was on an Airbus 380. I moved us to the front 2 seats at the emergency exit and we had plenty of room. The toilet kit and 'coronet' were appreciated as well as the wine and cognac. The food was nothing great. I tried to purchase upgraded meals for our return flight but the AF website never seemed to get me there. Check-in was always expedited. All the AF personnel we encountered were friendly and professional.
2155,"LIS-MAD on a regional Embraer aircraft. Economy seating which was only distinguished from business by a curtain (seats exactly the same). Ticket agents were pleasant no line and efficiently provided boarding pass. At the gate agents announced the flight orderly line and boarded the plane from the jetway. Aircraft seemed new seats were somewhat cramped for a 6'1"" pax. Refreshments were served. Arrived on time without any delay. Was out of the airport in less than 15 minutes."
2156,Gatwick-Madrid-Caracas. Overall not very pleasant but if you really need to save the difference in fare go for it. Pre-departure communication is very poor regarding e-tickets check-in etc. Checking in I had no problems having arrived about 1.45 before flight. Gatwick-Madrid was delayed nearly two hours.As a result I had to charge through Madrid airport to my gate where the connection to Caracas was waiting replete with angry Venezuelans. I found the staff very pleasant and accommodating and their English was very good. Food was bad worse than usual. The planes are in a bit of a state with reclining chairs needing to be manually pulled back into upright position that kind of thing. No problems with baggage. Overall I would probably have preferred to pay slightly more for TAP (Portugal) or another established airline.
2157,Gatwick to Madrid and on to Cancun - flight late only just made connecting flight. Return home economy - worst flight I have ever done. Food inedible no water until two half hours into flight and none until almost landing ten hours later- requests for drinks ignored by very rude staff. All announcements in Spanish and not had a reply to my email complaining.
2158,London to Caracas and back. Modern aircraft clean and pretty much in working order. Couldn't find cheap flights to CCS until Air Europa flights came up and were significantly better priced than everyone else. Flights between London and Madrid on tiny plane and had to pay for onboard food and drinks but perfectly acceptable. The transatlantic flights were great good leg room decent food and film on demand service (limited choice). Would use them again to get to Latin America.
2159,AI607 Mumbai-Bangalore on January 3rd. Flight was delayed but not so much by Indian standards. Plane was very very old. It felt like going back in time with some seats requiring quick repair before take off. Flight was a little unpleasant also because of the strong turbulence and a bunch of young crying kids. FA's were a little rude at times but always available. One very good thing is that a proper meal is served in a flight that is just over an hour long. While not my favorite I would still use them for flights within India in the future.
2160,BOM-DEL-FRA: Domestic sector was served by a mediocre A320 whereas International sector was with 787 usual. Surprisingly both the sectors went smooth as compared to my first experience (read below). The crew were polite and accommodating and breakfast served on domestic sector was tasty although tea and coffee was like black water. International leg had only 30 passengers so was a very light flight. Crew made an exceptional job with very polite rounds of drinks lunch snacks and special plum cake served always with smile and were more than happy to serve larger portions. The younger crew made all the efforts to make flight comfortable by dimming the window and switching off unwanted TV screens and always attended passengers request. AI 787 Dreamliner have great legspace that beats all European Airlines although AI should urgently update their entertainment system. Just one tip AI should make more efforts to keep aircraft clean as they are brand new though looked outdated and dusty carpet. This flight was a great experience and looking forward to served in similar manner.
2161,First time flying from Melbourne to Delhi and return. Dreamliner is great plane though found on both trips that remote controls were broken. Maintenance seems poor and seats dirty as well as hard though space is good. Very poor staff service and as remotes are broken you can't call attendants - deliberate? Toilets are very dirty and we ran out of toilet tissues. Had to remind staff. No cleaning of toilets as on most other airlines. Staff are lazy. Some exceptions but did not make up for non attentiveness. Could not believe poor movie choice - latest movies were two years old and most between 5-10 years. Issued good headphones but I used my Bose and relied on my own entertainment. We usually left late and the plane system is very poor in showing estimated arrival time. Food was poor. Was expecting some dinner and got served a snack which was terrible. Suspect I picked up Delhi belly on flights as well despite using my own hand cleaner. Will only use them as last resort. There are many better options. Use at your own risk.
2162,I was supposed to fly Air France from Frankfurt to Paris on September 20th 2014. However it was canceled due to a strike. I was re-booked on Luxair but I missed connection due the fact connections were too close. I was re- booked on a Lufthansa flight which left on time. On my return flight to Frankfurt Air France was operating once again but the service left a lot to the imagination. Most depressing thing about Air France was the fact they serve their customers instant coffee which they prepared in front of you. You would expect instant coffee from a non-coffee culture such Thailand. Air France can keep their cold croissant instant coffee and frigid staff.
2163,Flew AF from YUL to Paris on 777-300! Service was ok nothing exceptional food was below expectations both ways! The nice touch was the little bottle of Porto. Entertainment system was good going but old and bad coming back. I chose Air France rather than Air Canada because their service is suppose to be exceptional.
2164,I have been travelling with this airline mainly for business purpose and many times in business class. Am I expecting too much when I compare with their magazines and the image they try to carry? All in all I have never been happily surprised by nice new features that modern airlines may offer. Rather it is always more or less the same and in term of seat comfort in business class it clearly lags behind most of its serious competitor. Food is generally good but it can also be sometimes frankly disgusting (when you fly to Paris from a foreign country). Service is fine but seemingly very disorganised between boarding and take-off (flight attendants running in all directions back and forth with no apparent co-ordination - when are going to actually optimize their movements inside the very narrow pathways?). A nice old lady with old worn furniture and faded recipe the actual image of this airline.
2165,A charter flight for Thomson holidays from Humberside to Palma. Flight delayed both ways by around an hour. Inflight announcements from crew totally unintelligible due to heavy Spanish accent and speed of delivery. In flight snack consisted of one small roll with plastic type ham tiny chocolate and half a cup of lukewarm tea or coffee. On our return flight we had an hour of Air Europa promotional adverts on TV all in Spanish - played to an aircraft full of Brits!
2166,Madrid to Havana on Boeing 767-300: we flew with Air Europa as a result of a missed connection in MAD which prevented us from boarding our original flight. It appears that the airline is reserving its better aircraft for U. destinations and Latin America is treated to what's left. This particular B767 seemed OK at first but the seats are very tight and legroom is insufficient if you're over 180 cm/6 ft. tall. Unlike their A330s the 767 only has a few LCD screens across the cabin and you have to bring your own headphones. Throughout the entire flight the PA system was set to such a low volume that it was impossible to understand anything (even in Spanish as the crew's English was traditionally abysmal). Meals were also lacking - a dash after takeoff 7.5 hours of nothing and a small dry ciabatta just before arrival. Perhaps the worst experience came some 50 minutes into the flight: a girl sitting in front threw up in the aisle and the crew took more than 5 minutes to react making everyone extremely uncomfortable. Their solution was to rinse the carpet with cola cover it with a blanket and spray it with aerosol deodorant. Needless to say this method didn't work for long but nobody else seemed to bother (some hours later a second FA saw the blanket on the floor and assumed the girl's father dropped his so she pick it up and promptly covered him with it). Quite simply Air Europa creates a perfect impression of a Latin American low cost carrier and the passenger structure seemed to correspond. If you're looking for a decent flight to Cuba try someone else.
2167,MIA to MAD onto BCN. A330 about 2/3 full with tight seating however we managed to spread out as there were seats available. Dinner and drinks were served. Inflight movies fine a choice of over ten titles along with various documentaries etc in your own in-seat entertainment setup. Don't forget to bring your own earphones or you'll have to purchase theirs. The connection at MAD was quick as bags had been checked all the way through. The second segment a B737 seating tight with food for sale. Coming back all on time with same minimal service standards. However we got the tickets for about 75% of what Iberia or American would charge for the same route and we got what we paid for.
2168,This was our first trip on an Air India flight. I was interested to see how we found the trip I have flown on many other airlines in India. We had a very short trip from Udaiper to Mumbai. The flight arrived late they did try to make contact about this but the email arrived after we arrived in Mumbai. My main issue is that the stewards seemed to be totally indifferent towards their customers which I found to be unusual.
2169,Flew EWR (Newark) to IXE (Manglore) in December and back January. This was not my first choice of airline but due to the holiday rush this was the best I could get. I expected delays surly staff poor communication bad seats and an uncomfortable experience. I was pleasantly surprised. The flights were on time the staff were a mixed bunch but none were rude the food was good (one meal was lukewarm and one sandwich had nothing in it) the movie selection was decent and the seats were quite comfortable. Overall a good experience. I'm not sure if I just got lucky w these flight but if this is the level of service now then it has improved tremendously and I would fly Air India again.
2170,Flew from Delhi to Bangalore on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Good experience decent food and IFE for a very low price. Very comfortable seats was a bit late though.
2171,3rd Sept flight AF185. Last year we travelled with Air France to Paris from Melbourne and as experience and price were good we did again this month. I do not understand the criticisms of this airline. Both our experiences have been excellent. Yes the seats are not lie flat but they were particularly comfortable for sitting. The crew on both occasions were extremely friendly and attentive the food and wine was of a high standard and entertainment had plenty of choices. We think this is very good value for money and will continue to fly Air France when we can.
2172,Aug 8th CGK-SIN-CDG on B777/300. Was flying home on an awards ticket in economy class. One set of crew from CGK- SIN and another set of crew from SIN-CDG. In spite of flying in economy class and on an awards ticket the chief flight attendant on the CGK-SIN sector personally greeted me. This was as a result of my elite plus Sky Team Alliance status. I enjoy Indian food and had ordered an Indian meal for both sectors knowing from past experience that I would get a very good Indian meal ex. SIN. I was not disappointed with the butter chicken. Leg room was minimal and seat comfort was barely adequate for the 13 hour flight. Cabin crew were professional. In-flight entertainment was adequate but poor when compared to other 4 star airlines. Flights departed and arrived on time throughout the journey.
2173,"August 9th CDG-YUL on an older B747/400. This review is actually a continuation of my journey from CGK-SIN-CDG submitted in my earlier review. I am submitting this review separately due to the largely different journey experience. Once we boarded our flight we were told that our flight would be delayed due to a surprise inspection from the French Civil Aviation Authority. We were initially told the departure would be delayed by an hour. This was followed by an announcement that the inspection uncovered a technical problem and that we would have to deplane and change aircraft. We received meal vouchers to tide us over. We eventually departed 4 hours late for Montreal but were all glad to be finally on our way. Once on board I was approached by the flight attendant and asked to confirm that I had ordered a special meal. I was looking forward to my Indian meal especially since the meal from the previous flight from SIN had been so good. Instead I received a meal of ""Alaskan Pollack With A Leek Cream Sauce"" which had nothing to do with Indian food. When I mentioned this to the flight attendant her response was merely to say that she was also surprised to see this meal served as an Indian meal. After having eaten the presented meal the same flight attendant returned to me and asked me if I was satisfied with my meal. I politely answered that I wasn't satisfied because it wasn't what I ordered and expected. On the same flight I encountered a flight attendant with completely an opposite attitude who was very helpful in supplying me with ice packs to keep my insulin chilled since they were forbidden from storing my insulin in their on board chillers. This is probably why many passengers speak highly of Asian airline flight crews and often express positive comments about Asian service standards and service attitude. When was the last time a North American or European based airline won the Skytrax cabin crew of the year award?"
2174,First and last flight I will take with them. Had flown London-Havana via Amsterdam with no problem with KLM. Return flight with AF - not so. Firstly flight to Paris was cancelled. Received a text about 16 hrs before flight despite them knowing 3 days in advance. Eventually another plane was chartered via Air Caraibes. We ended up leaving 3 hrs later and arriving in CDG after we were originally due to be in London. In Cuba we were told (rudely) we had been booked onto a flight with BA that was leaving at 9pm meaning we arrived in London 9 hrs after we were due to be there with a 7 hr wait in CDG. Told to get boarding pass from AF desk in Paris. Got there to find 4 staff going at snails pace (again rudely) whilst 300 irate and upset passengers waited to get their ongoing passes. We were almost at the front yet waited 70 mins to be told we had to go to the BA desk 2 terminals away. They didn't actually speak to me by the way preferring to speak to my husband. Got to the BA desk who after trying to get a pass for 2 hrs said AF needed to release the booking. My husband ran back and forth between terminals 2a and 2e 3 times before AF would listen to him and eventually conceded that it was their fault. Did we get any apology? No. I will never fly with them again.
2175,Paris CDG to Valencia. I was upgraded to the tiny Business class. Very small plastic cup of water or juice was offered before departure by smiling stewardess. Drinks arrive with a small meal - everything in plastic. No champagne but cava Cordon nero meaning a better brand than the one sold in Economy. The difference maybe the only one you don't pay for your drinks in Business! A bit disappointing experience.
2176,We arrived at Miami Airport at 7pm no line for checking in. The staff was professional and helped. Our flight boarded on time to Madrid plane was clean. Food was airplane food staff friendly. Airplane well equipped screen for movies music etc. Our connecting flight to Paris was on time my bags arrived and had no problems.
2177,My flight was from Moscow to Gran Canaria. Being a member of the SkyTeam Alliance they do not care at all about the business class passengers or about the services both on ground and on board. Moscow to Madrid was operated by Aeroflot. The seats in business class are comfortable in A320 crew is helpful. I checked my luggage to Gran Canaria but noticed it on the belt in Madrid. I have informed airport officials Air Europa representatives about the fact that by mistake my luggage was in Madrid though it should be passed to Gran Canaria. They assured me that in 10 minutes the airport staff will pass my luggage to my next plane. On the boarding gate I have asked to check that my luggage was on board. The representative of Air Europa assured me that the luggage was inside. When I arrived in Gran Canaria - my luggage was not delivered. The investigation revealed that it was still in Madrid. The ridiculous thing is that the situation is being repeated for the second time. Never will use Air Europa any more. Flying Gran Canaria to Barcelona business class the plane is ok crew is rude and not friendly. The food is very slight seats are as in economy class. Barcelona to Moscow the check in procedure is awful. The business class counter did not register business class passengers for Moscow as the flight was operated by Aeroflot.
2178,"Took this flight because of convenient timing. Check in was smooth. Surprisingly they started boarding early, more than 1 hour before flight time. Plane was only 3 minutes from the terminal. We got to the plane and thee was no AC, temperature outside was over 40 degrees Celsius (Dubai in July). Passengers were getting very restless and children were crying due to heat. They had us on the plane for a very long time and we ended up leaving late, so more than 1 hour on the plane. AC only went on properly 15 minutes after take off. The aircraft was very very old and dirty. Flight was smooth and crew was friendly. They need to use newer planes, or reconsider. People use this because of timing and non-stop route to Pune. I think if there were better option no one would go on it."
2179,AI120 26th December. Arrival at FRA ??discovered we could use any of the LH business lounges. Arrived at terminal A so used the brand new A lounge for a couple of hours (had a 6hr layover). Then took a trek to terminal B popped in to the lounge for an hour or so. Similar layout and food. Reception staff very pleasant. LH lounges are pleasant enough good selection of drinks food is at best minimal and quite uninteresting. WIFI is good ??easy connect and quick enough to video skype. The B lounge is right next to the gate so it really is a 1 minute walk. No calls though and the monitors only show the boarding times so be careful! We strolled to the gate to find we were the last to board. Greeted very politely by the crew issued new boarding cards and shown to our seats which were taken. The interlopers were swiftly moved on and we sat and made ourselves comfortable. A choice of drinks was presented along with a hot towel and some eye masks. The crew were really nice a mix of ages and all were very pleasant courteous and helpful. Cabin dÃ©cor leaves an awful lot to be desired but the seats are spacious and very comfortable. Not as garish as some of the pictures but definitely not easy on the eye. No sooner had we levelled off then the crew came round offering pre-dinner drinks and shortly after this it was time for dinner (it was a late flight). Flight crew arrived with cotton tablecloths and served either a chicken shashlik or prawn curry served with the usual naan rice and vegetables. Vegetarian options also available. Prawn curry was yummy. Washed down with a decent red wine. Slept the remainder of the flight to Delhi. 2nd Sector Delhi transit is a right PITA. Slow cumbersome numerous passport and boarding card checks. Eventually made it through (luckily at the front of the queue ??if you had a short transfer you'd be in trouble). Lounge is pleasant. Except for some building work going on just outside. WIFI is incredibly difficult and awkward to connect to. Couple of PCs available. Didn't eat whilst we were there so can't comment on the food. Found a couple of recliners and slept for an hour. 10 minute walk to the gate boarded and departed right on time. Again the crew on board were really pleasant and very attentive. Mixed ages again. Greeted with drinks and hot towels. Limited movie choices. Again the food choice was limited but what was provided was delicious. A decent white wine this time and copious G&Ts combined for the next important stage of the journey ??sleep! Seat is again a proper lie flat. Padding a bit thin but if you sleep on the duvet they provide this cushions the seat cover. A thin blanket (also provided) is enough as a cover as the cabin is warm. Got woken about an hour or so before landing and had a really nice chicken biryani for breakfast. Bit odd but not much else to choose from. Landed smoothly but unfortunately no priority bags on arrival. Not a big issue but would have been nice. We consoled ourselves that the bags had arrived at all. Overall ??great value great staff delicious food very comfortable flight on time and safe. The whole experience was surprisingly pleasant and I would use them again.
2180,Flew on SYD-DEL sector last month. Food is really good specially if you love Indian food. Entertainment system is good with lot of Bollywood options English selections are though few. Seats were wide and comfortable but a bit hard for 13 hour journey. Staff is courteous and listens to you unlike some Chinese airlines where it was a nightmare to make them understand what you needed. Arrival and departure time are perfect if you live in Delhi and Sydney.
2181,I traveled thrice to Delhi from JFK and back in 2014 and I feel now I would prefer any other airline if I have an option next time when I travel. The last trip I took was on the last week of December 2014. Pros - Flight is pretty much always on time and the fare is reasonable compared to most other international airlines on the same route. Cons - The seats are not so comfortable firm dirty as if the covers have not been cleaned or washed in a long time. The crew members are not of the standard to be aboard an international flight. They just lack service quality compared to the likes of Emirates or Qatar. Very unprofessional. They only show up during refreshment services. Care less to see if any passengers would need assistance with anything else through out the flight. They don't clean the rest rooms or feel the need to fill in tissues once these runs out. Half of the entertainment systems are broken and rest are just slow. They also barely update the contents in the entertainment systems. I traveled back to back in two months and found same movies. Food is horrible. Just bad. Air India domestic has far better service.
2182,Review about a flight in Business Class Paris-Tokyo. Old Business Class cabin: noisy and not comfortable. Dirty even at the beginning of the flight. Poor service: no attention to passengers and no smiles. Average entertainment system with too many bad second class French movies.
2183,Flight AF0503 and AF0508 13-19 Feb. CAI to CDG departure and arrival on time friendly crew clean aircraft but the food was not nice at all.
2184,Flew CDG-GRU and back. Both flights were very nice some turbulence but nothing too bad crew very attentive and friendly. Food was also very good (they served dinner and breakfast on both flights) and drinks were available throughout the whole flight. For the money I paid I got great value. Neither flight was delayed it took off and landed on time. I will definitely fly Air France again especially to Brazil.
2185,I used travelled Air India Express back in September on AUH-COK-AUH sector. The fare was pretty much the best compared to other airlines. AUH-COK took off on time and with only less than 50 passengers on board due to off- season. The crew were pleasant and helpful. They provided snacks and even I got 3 bottles of water extra upon request. On the return the flight was almost full. Good service on time departure on both segments. Surprisingly there was not any IFE screens there. After describing the security and safety instructions the screens were turned off and folded back to the berth!
2186,This is a summary of several flights I have taken on AIX on the Dubai-Pune-Dubai route. These flights were at a very convenient time during the day. Now they have been shifted to the early hours of the morning which makes it less convenient though still better than driving BOM-PNQ-BOM. All the flights I have taken so far have been smooth and excellent - take-offs landings and en route. Service is generally excellent and they surprisingly serve a small snack with unlimited water. I have invariably requested and obtained emergency exit seats with ample legroom. Toilets are clean again surprisingly but smell a bit. The main thing that needs to be improved is the maintenance of the cabin. The carpets are worn and the leather seats need refurbishing. The interior of these 738 aircraft need a good scrubbing. But other than that AIX does well on this route.
2187,Flew from Dubai to Lucknow and back to Dubai. The crew seemed bored and the service was horrible. The table was broken and the meal served was inedible. The toilets were dirty. The seats were uncomfortable which made spending those hours on the aircraft unbearable. Choosing Air India Express was a poor choice in spite of the low cost tag attached to it.
2188,LHR-DEL-BKK. Ticket was cheap and onboard food was as good as you get in Economy class. However I found the cabin crew to be lazy as they never responded to the call button meaning I had to go to the galley when I wanted something like a drink. Also the entertainment was disappointing because although it was video-on-demand the selection of decent Western films was limited and there was no Western music only Indian. Furthermore the staff at Delhi Airport were so rude with far too many checks yet insufficient staff that meant getting through checks at Delhi during transit took far too long. Basically I will only go with Air India again if it is dirt cheap.
2189,FRA-DEL-MUM: 30th Nov 14. Ground staff to aircraft crew were just disinterested. Passengers were greeted by young friendly crew but that's it. Other members clearly were not happy with their jobs. Captains announcement were rather short and straight. Seats still had bread crumbs on them and tables had oily stains this was on a new 787-8. Drinks had restricted choice. Cola or Juice. Food served in aluminium foil was shabbily presented and was overcooked. Crew members never gave service with smile although they did attend when called. Domestic sector was better than international flight. Aircraft was extremely old with tattered carpet and food was again shabbily presented but crew were polite and accommodating. Air India its time to pull up your socks as a part of star alliance passengers will choose to other airlines to your shabby service. Lack of Professionalism was very evident!
2190,"DEL-BKK. They got me there (not my bag however). I was on a new 787 in Business and the interior was a bit dowdy and there was a large chunk of my window armrest missing exposing the foam beneath. The amenities were slippers and an eye shade in a paper bag. The crew was present but not really involved with the passengers outside of the necessary interactions. All the meal offerings were Indian with one being vegetarian. It was all served on a single tray and the wine ""selection"" was red or white - served from half bottles. The overall experience was equivalent to a similar 4 hour sector in the US in First where the product is improved over coach but the flight did not measure up to other international carriers."
2191,Did a business flight on the route from New Delhi to Paris: AF 225 seat 5K. Great experience staff very friendly and smiling all the time. Good food but small screen for in-flight entertainment.
2192,My family including my 3 year old daughter had a flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport to Manchester which we had booked 8 months previous. We were unable to carry out an online check in before taking flight due to poor wifi signal at our holiday destination so arrived at check in 3 hours before our flight was due to leave to give us plenty of time. When we checked in we were told the flight was already full and we were placed on stand by. After waiting at gate for everyone else to board we were informed that only two seats were available and we could split up if we wanted or stay as a group of 3 on the next flight to Manchester. We decided to stay as a family - we went to the customer service desk only to be told that the next flight was completely full. After spending an hour at the desk with a very bored and upset young child we were informed that the only flight we could take that day was to Birmingham over 90 miles away from Manchester where our car was parked. After 11 hours in the airport we departed - on arrival to Birmingham we then had to organise transportation at considerable cost to ourselves to Manchester to collect our car. Safe to say I will never fly with Air France again and I will never recommend them to anyone else as there customer service was appalling.
2193,Flying on A380 from CDG to SFO on the upper deck in the smaller section with only 5 rows I again enjoyed the excellent food quality and wine selection. The crew was also exceptionally friendly so that the overall experience was quite pleasant. If the seats get replaced to flat beds then there will be very little to complain. The only thing that could may be improved is the selection of new movies.
2194,I flew Air France with six different legs of a European trip in August. Each time we flew into CDG. Fabulous employees. But not one departure left on time. Departures varied from 20 minutes delayed to over an hour. Missed one connection due to this and twice my daughter's wheelchair was lost and finally located again but we were always last leaving plane. Our luggage was lost for one and a half days on our first leg of trip (CDG to Manchester UK) because the flight left Boston so late we were connected to a smaller regional aircraft due to arriving late in CDG thus missing the scheduled Air France flight. In Boston we were told to get our boarding passes for the flight to UK in Paris. In Paris they asked for our boarding passes and it took over an hour to resolve that we were told to get them in Paris and that was the first leg of our disappointing trip. Again wonderful staff but it seems one airport location does not communicate well to another location which then uses up a lot of time at help desks at each airport trying to resolve the issues. The only time our delay was acknowledged was on our last leg of trip back to Boston - this left 20 minutes late which wasn't too bad but we sat on tarmac in Boston without much information for over an hour. The next day we got an e-mail from Air France apologizing for that. But the other five legs of the trip also were with problems. I would not fly Air France again unless I really had no other option unfortunately.
2195,Apart from having point to point connection there is nothing else that this airline can offer. I flew from Dubai to Amritsar and back and found this trip rather exhausting and uncomfortable due to the airline service. Being a budget carrier does mean to save costs but its doesn't mean to keep your aircraft's dirty and unhygienic. When I entered the aircraft both the times I felt as I am traveling in one of those public buses which are disposed for public use (to be honest even public buses are well maintained that Air India Express aircraft's) the crew looked angry for no reason it felt as if they were punished to come here and serve us they did not have the decency to speak politely with passengers and just dumped their frustration on us. Food was awful as everything looked stale and had no taste. Since this was the only flight available for me to reach Amritsar I was forced to take it.
2196,Booked Dubai-Pune-Dubai in Jan 2014 however had to change the Dubai-Pune leg of the journey. My return journey (Pune-Dubai) was a nightmare. On arriving at the airport in the early hours of the morning I realized that my flight had been delayed for reasons unknown/unannounced to me. Then delayed 40 minutes in the security check line because other domestic flights need to be released earlier. After much delay I arrive at the final gate only to see no information displayed about my flight. Its delayed further. No one at any counter to enquire for any information. Felt relieved when the announcement to board was being made but there was more to come we were made to sit inside the aircraft as the pilots did not have clearance from ATC. It turned out to be for an hour or more until we finally were given clearance to fly. So a trip which I chose on purpose to save time and money did everything else but those two things.
2197,Flew Pune to Dubai and back. Flight was on time in both legs. Seat quality could have been improved. No common inflight entertainment too as airline fell short of earphones for passengers so did not distribute any. Snacks were served but were unhealthy (deep fried). Air hostesses had a stern look through the journey. Cost of ticket was very less as compared to full service carriers.
2198,My return flight from Mumbai to London was via Delhi. The flight departure times of the first leg Mumbai-Delhi (AI809) have been changed 3 times since I booked the flight in September. This has caused so many uncertainties with hotel booking in Mumbai. The final departure time was delayed by 3 hours to 7AM thus making it an uncomfortable morning on the day. To add to the misery when I reached the airport I learnt that the flight is delayed by 2.20 hours. This information was obtained by enquiring the assistance desk - none of the flight status TVs had updated this information.
2199,Travelled Bangalore Mumbai Delhi and back in September 2014. First plane was airbus A319 second was airbus A320. The good: Flights took off and landed on time. Clean and neat aircraft's. Polite crew smooth procedures everywhere. Average food. Inflight entertainment was there from BOM to DEL. The bad: No IFE on the DEL-BLR flight Expensive airfare at times. Limited supply of Non veg food.
2200,Air India AI996 DXB-DEL B777-300ER. Full flight on Dec 24. Air India ground services handled by local handler DNATA was a disaster. Check in was relatively smooth but boarding gate was changed from C13 to C7 and there was no announcement to inform passengers. The crowded boarding gate was disorganized and no proper announcement was made to give priority boarding. Flight crew seemed to be less interested in service. Food was good and service was quick. Inflight entertainment was decent enough though live flight map was not available. Seats were little shabby and was in need of maintenance. Overall experience was below expectation.
2201,I flew DME-DEL-GOI-DEL-DME in mid December. What can I say - before making the first flight with AI I thought it wouldn't be the best experience. Now the reality: staff are polite and efficient both on international and domestic segments. A bit unorganized on the ground. Food - good. It's Indian expect curry but a very good curry and quite a large portion. aircraft's: all-new 787 and 319. They are just new and I have nothing to complain. Entertainment system is not to Emirates standards but quite close to that on Lufthansa's new 747-8. So the price is not cheap but the airline provides a good product for that price. Will fly them again.
2202,I had a connecting flight from London to Bangkok via Paris CDG. I want to review my long-haul flight. First it was 2 hours delay and I missed my next flight to Denpasar. Passengers didn't receive any free food/drinks while waiting for the aircraft to be ready. Paris CDG terminal 2E had serious problems with their toilets. 2 or 3 male's toilets had been flooded. I was lucky enough to select a seat at the back and I had the whole row to my disposal. However all monitors in the row was dirty from a previous flight. Window glass was dirty. Flight attendants were attentive and smiling. However they provided service twice during 11 hour flight: dinner and breakfast. No drinks offered after dinner. Trays with soft drinks (no wine no beer) had been placed nearby kitchen and staff were lounging in their area. I'm always travelling between Asia and Europe and I booked combined ticket from Bangkok to London by KLM and London to Bangkok by Air France. What a difference! Fantastic KLM staff great food fair drinks and cold drinks served every hour during the night flight. Not on Air France flight. Would I choose them again for long-haul flight. I would avoid them.
2203,Air France flight JFK-CDG on 22nd Aug 2014 was excellent. Very good courteous and enthusiastic cabin crew and good food and wine.
2204,Originally a KLM flight however the flight was overbooked and I was re-routed through Paris with Air France (2 days prior to actual flight). Flying Bangkok-CDG-Prague and return. It was and is quite annoying that Air France offers online check in however has all seats (apart from some mid aisle) blocked and you are unable to choose or plan all AF is trying to push is seats with more legroom but many fail to realise that these are just by the lavatories and kitchens thus very uncomfortable (lights crowded and many just stand there to stretch). Actual check-in in Bangkok painless and quick the flight was operated by a brand new 777-300 quite tasty food and acceptable entertainment. The whole flight could have been a great one but there has been ZERO cabin crew presence for a 12 hrs flight. Food was delivered fast and it was collected even faster and then no one was to be found. Absolutely speechless when a crew actually refused to bring drinks for a family with kids commenting that there is a bar at the rear galley (the one they failed to announce so few people knew). Return flight uneventful (with much older plane with visibly less comfort and legroom and ancient useless entertainment) and surprised that the transit in CDG was all right except having 20+ passport control booths and only 1 serviced! Flights on time and baggage unharmed. All in all a very standard flight but if having a choice I would go with other airlines who offer a bit more value for money and attention.
2205,I've travelled from Paris CDG to Berlin Tegel (TXL) (to go and return). I enjoyed my first flight very nice crew with a lot of choices of beverages. Even different types of wine were proposed. However my flight back was disappointing. Crew much less polite beverages were only hot chocolate and coffee. It was an early flight but they could have still offered orange or apple juice for example. Regarding the seat comfort nothing to say they were quite comfortable for a medium-haul flight.
2206,Traveled SHJ-COK-SHJ last month. I have selected this flight because the holiday season started and IX was the cheapest available from UAE to Kochi. After my disastrous trip by Air India last month on the same sector I was not expecting much from IX but I should admit that I was surprised. Nice and clean aircraft with enough legroom polite cabin crew who were attending the passengers with a smile and on time take off and landing was part of the surprise package. And all these were for half the price of the next available airline.
2207,"DXB-PNQ-DXB. Check in was smooth at DXB T2 and I managed to get 1C. The plane from the inside looked a bit shabby as most AI aircraft somehow do but I was happy for the extra legroom for my 6'3"" frame. A very overweight couple took seats 1A and B after smiling sheepishly at me. The man was overflowing into my seat. I saw that 1D was empty and moved over. AIX served a flimsy cardboard box containing a sandwich a small packet of banana chips something fried and inedible and a muffin. Strange assortment but better than nothing and welcome on a low cost carrier. Unlimited water as well. Drinks are chargeable. Flight left about 30 minutes late but arriving into PNQ was a breeze and I was home in 10 minutes after leaving the airport. Check-in in PNQ for the return leg was chaotic as usual and the woman insisted my bags were overweight. I smiled a lot and finally after I removed my laptop from my hand luggage she let me go through and even gave me a reclining exit row seat. The seat bottom was worn out and the metal bar kept poking my rear. When I asked for a blanket (even a used blanket) I was told they had run out of them. I avoided serious long term damage to my tailbone by moving and shifting through the flight. Same food was served on this leg. Overall it was good value for money. But basic maintenance a word missing in India's lexicon could be better. Sitting on metal for 3 hours is no fun."
2208,DXB-IXE. Boarded with apprehension but quite pleasantly surprised. Reasonably clean aircraft pleasant crew and food! Not bad for a budget airline and way better than Air India (the so called full service airline). Have flown them a couple of times again on the same sector.
2209,I am regular passenger in UAE-Kerala route. Flights seems to be fairly reasonable compared to the fare structure and clean. Crew helpful. But the snacks to be supplied as per the timing. On mid night flights supplying banana chips and cakes really upset the stomach. Any toasted bread sandwiches (veg or non-veg) would be more ideal which will not add up the cost to the airlines. The fare calculation methods seems strange. Sometimes a person buying an online ticket far earlier before 1 or two months pays more than someone take it on the day or previous day of the flight. Also the taxes calculation. More basic fare is with less tax and vice versa. Recently the cancellation charges have been increased to 35% which is really unbearable. It should be reversed to 10% before 10 days and 15% prior to 24 hrs at least.
2210,I flew from Heathrow to Delhi in the B787. The seat was extremely comfortable but the inflight entertainment system did not work for the whole flight! The cabin was extremely cold. Luckily on the trip back from Delhi to Heathrow we were in the B777-300ER we had lovely seats next to the loo and tea machine and our inflight entertainment system worked a treat. The food was also great and the air hostesses were excellent. All in all I would fly the Air India B777-300ER again!
2211,Flying from DUB (Dublin) to CDG (Paris) on an Air France service operated by Cityjet. A great service overall for this short flight with an onboard snack which consisted of a selection of sandwiches and drinks. Crew were very friendly and seats were comfortable with good legroom in the economy section. There was a 20 minute delay on the return flight caused by a problem with the airport buses however it was an early morning flight so the pilot said he was able to take 'shortcuts'. This worked and we landed in Dublin on time despite the delay. Overall for the service provided on such a short flight it is hard to rate the airline down. Flights arrived on time were comfortable and had friendly staff. I would easily fly with Air France again.
2212,Flight 083 SFO to CDG - July 15th. 084 CDG to SFO July 30th. 1609 Stuttgart to CDG July 30th. Had a wonderful experience with Air France. Quite honestly I am surprised that there are bad reviews with this airline. Food and French wine was superb. Service was excellent. Seats in business class extremely comfortable. I slept 6 hours straight from SFO to Paris. I would with Air France again and look forward to it.
2213,CDG-BOS. We started of with 7 hours delay in Charles de Gaulles the plane (747) was very old the staff and cabin crew was unfriendly and the food was not up to other airlines standards. First and last Air France Long haul flight.
2214,Singapore to Calcutta return. An adequate performance from this budget carrier. The flights were on time the comfort was adequate and the staff generally reasonably friendly. The only slight downside was the quality of food offered in the snackbox - barely edible pastries and deep fried cookies. However the flight is only about 4 hours so having little to eat wasn't a big problem. The tickets were 50% cheaper than the only other carrier to offer non-stop flights on this route (Singapore Air) so overall I was extremely pleased with Air India Express.
2215,TRZ to KUL via Chennai return. The aircraft was relatively clean on both sectors. Since this was the only flight to Trichy from Kuala Lumpur I thought it would be more practical to just take this flight since there is no hassle of getting out into Chennai. However the transit procedure in Chennai is terrible. We had to get on bus queue up till everyone got off the plane and go though security check again. For the price you pay the service is not at all worthwhile.
2216,I paid INR 13000 on IX flight from Kolkata to Singapore compared to about 21000 in SQ. The aircraft was clean crew reasonably friendly. They served snacks on the flight. I would say if they keep the aircraft clean and maintains time it's good value for money. I would have to fly few more times to see if they are reliable!
2217,I travelled on Air India recently from Singapore to Chennai. The flight was on time good hot breakfast was served. IFE had good selection of Indian and English movies. The best part is the spacious new 787 Dreamliner had full flat beds. It was very comfortable. FA were attentive and polite.
2218,Travelled Birmingham to Delhi return in November 2014. Found the Dreamliner very comfortable. There was only a slight delay on the return flight due to a counter glitch at Delhi airport. The cabin crew were friendly and professional. I must congratulate Air India in employing crew members of all ages. Both my wife and I have noticed a major improvement in services offered by Air India. I hope the Airline continue to provide this level of service. The food offered during the flight was of a good standard. Finally the Maharaja Lounge at Delhi airport was of a high standard.
2219,Birmingham to Amritsar. I was impressed with new Dreamliner seats entertainment everything spot on. Staff really good and helpful. Due to Fog flight was delayed (2 hours) from BHX and on the way back again due to Fog flight was 3 hours delayed from ATQ. Air India took care of all the passengers on the airport and provided Breakfast and snacks. Delay in DEL airport (we had to wait for 5 hours and we were not allowed to go out) its a shame. Don't know what the reason was for delay. Other than that no issues no problems.
2220,23 July - Jakarta - Singapore - Paris (AF) - Amsterdam (KLM) Premium Economy was fine. However the return journey AF 0254 5th August 2014 - Premium Economy Paris - Singapore - Jakarta was extremely disappointing frustrating and uncomfortable. Despite several attempts before leaving Jakarta to check-in online and select seats and again prior to our return flight this was not possible (yet online check-in from Jakarta - Paris was no problem). Seat allocation on check-in at Amsterdam Schiphol noted 'SBY' having been allocated by Air France. We presented to 'Customer Service' CDG to be told seats cannot be allocated until close of the boarding gate because 'standby' had been allocated - why? we booked our flights in May 2014! At the Gate we were told to wait until boarding was called that we would be on the flight and they were hoping to upgrade us. When we re-presented as advised we were told an upgrade wasn't possible but we 'could' be allocated separated premium economy seats - for a couple married 36 years on a 17 hour flight - this is unacceptable! No-one was able to do anything - the ground staff person was surprised we were unhappy and said an upgrade was not promised. The flight crew re-allocated us seats together but then an unhappy traveller arrived to find one of us in his seat - embarrassing for us and for him. This gentleman did agree to being re-seated. Anticipating a problem for the final leg of out journey (Singapore- Jakarta) we asked the cabin crew who shrugged and said yes there would be a problem; the ground staff in the Transfer area said the plane is full and no it was not possible for us to sit together. This is a short flight so no real issue - however my husband had an empty seat beside him so he asked and I was invited to move - but no- one actually considered this! In fact there were at least 3 empty seats in Premium Economy - it seems that neither the ground staff nor the flight attendants have any idea of the seating on board their flight. We have traveled to Europe Asia and Australia every year often more than once a year for the past 11 years. We will not travel with an airline that does not care about what is important to us!
2221,I travelled to South America and back in premium economy. Was quite apprehensive after reading various negative reviews. But to my surprise the flight the crew and service was excellent. The aircraft was good and the air hostesses were very efficient and polite. The seats were also very comfortable.
2222,Air France (Hop!) LIL-BOD. 1 hour short flight with the CRJ700 security and boarding was quick and efficient at the Lesquin airport (no priority for elite members) drinks and a very small snack served after takeoff followed by sweets before landing. Good service overall.
2223,Air France 006 or Delta 1020 on July 29 2014 Seat 61F Airbus 380. I paid 100% of a business class ticket on Air France airbus 380 and this is what I got: The entertainment system didn't work and the smell of urine coming from the toilet was unacceptable. Asked to have a seat changed but was told the flight was sold out. Next time Air France will not be my first choice.
2224,Family of 4 holding Executive Class tickets to Chennai on Wednesday 26 Nov 2014 - food was not very good. Staff service okay. Did not understand why the staff allow economy passengers to walk through the Biz class to use the toilets. Staff from Singapore to Chennai did not give us menu cards but Chennai to Singapore the staff did and found time to talk to us and explain the meals. Inflight movie was good. I like Air India I just wish that people in the Indian airports can be more organised. I will compliment the inflight staff out of Chennai but not as good from Singapore. Overall needs improvement to attract more passengers to Biz.
2225,I am a frequent flyer in the BOM-CCU sector. At first I was quite apprehensive to fly Air India because of the frequent delays. To my surprise the flights were excellent for both legs and on time departure and arrival. The crew were excellent both ways. Hot and delicious breakfast were served both ways. There was no IFE on either flights. The seats were comfortable with ample leg room.
2226,Nice-Venice. A319. Packed. Delayed on departure. On time at arrival. Very cheap ticket (cheaper than Easyjet and with more luggage). Seats did not reclined. Service was ok.
2227,Air France 254 CDG to SIN July 9. As a French national I like to fly with Air France when it's possible. The team on board was very efficient. They provided their new bed sheet and pillow which makes a difference and means you can have a better sleep. The food is always excellent.
2228,JFK-CDG-NCE and FRA-CDG in Business. At JFK terminal 1 already looks old and decrepit compared to other new terminals. The AF lounge was closed due to renovation and we used JL lounge which was pretty disappointing. On board service was decent but agree with comments that for a country which prides itself on food AF food was disappointing. Seats were not the new ones but still decent and managed 3 hours of sleep. CDG-NCE and FRA-CDG was a total let down with just middle seat blocked ; no clue why European carriers do this yet seem to think this is a huge service- would be easier to have bigger seats like in US. Product still not close to EK or SQ but maybe with new seats it will come close.
2229,Flew from IAD to PRG via CDG. Delayed about 1 hour because of problems with cargo loading air-conditioning during that time not operational. Flight Entertainment had to be reset twice. In cabin about ten screaming infants. Not a pleasant flight.
2230,I flew PEK-FNJ at the start of my holiday in the DPRK. I had a bit of trepidation flying on North Korea's state airline but was pleasantly surprised. The Tupolev was smart and modern and the plane was new. We had a reasonable amount of space and the staff were smartly dressed and friendly. The food was a burger with a mystery meat inside which was not very nice and I did not finish it. The air ticket was part of my holiday package so I do not know what it cost.
2231,Delhi-London-Delhi Business Class travel in November this year. The journey was overall comfortable with good seats and ontime performance. DEL-LHR sector good cabin crew with average service they say X brand of beer available and when you ask they say oh its not cold we have Y brand. The food layout was average nothing to compare with BA or Emirates they are superb. LHR-DEL menu card given and then taken back saying sorry it was the First Class Menu please read the Business Class now. The crew were a lot older and I guessed that might be the reason for not apt customer service barring 1 or 2 crew members. All in all a great price though and convenient timings which makes it a choice. Full flights considering now a part of Star Alliance. If the customer service and food is improved marginally then full marks for sure.
2232,A319 from Mumbai to Bangalore. Delayed start arrived 20 min late. Clean cabin with half the IFE not working. Friendly crew quick breakfast service. Poor meal with flimsy plastic cutlery. Apparently a recent cost cutting measure. The flimsy hot beverage cup had no handle just a tab to hold with the tips of two fingers!
2233,Ageing A-320 from Bangalore to Mumbai. Some fixtures missing. Starboard engine made a constant loud jarring noise in the front cabin for about 15-20 min until plane settled into cruise. On time departure and landed 15 min early. Decent meal but with the new cost-cutting plastic cutlery. Crew were friendly and happily served extra beverage in a proper cup this time.
2234,First time flying with Air India from LHR to Delhi. The outbound flight AI 116 was delayed by 1.5 hours due to technical issues on the aircraft - Boeing Dreamliner. Check-in was breeze and staff were professional and friendly. I was lucky enough to get upgraded to business class. Seats and cabin was extremely comfortable and seats reclined flat. Service was good and friendly but it lacked the professionalism experienced on other premium carriers - the younger staff not as diligent as older staff. Food was good although the red wine was exceptional. Inflight not great but still had enough variety to pass the time. Return flight was on Boeing 777 in economy- surprised by the amount of legroom and comfort of seat - better than BA! Again found older staff better than younger staff. Food was disappointing although no worse than BA - I found the pre-landing snack inedible. Also I found the control functions for lights games and tv were not working. In fact the tv for both my wife and son were not working at all. Luckily I had my tablets and iPad! Overall I found AI no worse than travelling on BA. Service could be improved and some the aircraft facilities need updating but the same can be said for many other flag carriers.
2235,"ICN-CDG. Business Class. B777-300. No queue at check-in. No priority security lane (although there was only a short queue anyway). The KAL lounge near to the gate was adequate. Separate First/Business boarding lane. Initial impressions were of a cabin that is past its best. The seat arms were worn and my TV monitor had a crack in the screen. On time departure with lunch served at 10.45 local time! Immediately afterwards on this day time flight the window blinds were pulled down and the lights turned off. This situation continued until about 90 minutes from CDG. The in-flight entertainment was not very extensive particularly for non-French speakers. Most of the crew did what was necessary but no more. Lots of ""bonjour"" and ""au revoir"" but not much in between. Arrived 40 minutes early due to tail winds. Priority passport check with no delays. Did not get an opportunity to freshen up as no arrival lounge appears to be available in Terminal 2E. As no AF personnel were visible between the aircraft and exiting the baggage area I didn't have a chance to ask if one was available."
2236,CAI-CDG return 2 adults and 2 children. Flight out was punctual and reasonably good service. Very good value ticket. Good selection of movies (including kids) but not as many as Singapore or Emirates. Cabin temperature was very cold on both outgoing and incoming flights. Got a premium economy upgrade on boarding on the return leg. This meant a very comfy seat and nicer food. The boarding started on time but the boarding went very slowly and the flight took off around 30 mins late with no explanation from staff. This led to a 30 min late arrival into CAI.
2237,"Flew from TLV to SFO by way of CDG. On the evening prior to our flight we were notified by way of a very simple email that our flight had been canceled. No phone numbers were provided of personnel who could assist us with rescheduling nor were we able to call the local customer service number as they close in TLV at 5pm and this was past 10. We Skype'd with customer service in the US and were told that we had been rebooked on El Al - which is great but someone could have told us! Anyway we flew out of TLV with El Al to connect in CDG to SFO and the flight was uneventful. Old ugly plane with seats that have no support or leg room (I'm 5'10"" long legs) and a horrible entertainment system. The stewardesses tried that has to be said but their service was perfunctory at best. I think the main problem is that it honestly feels as though AF doesn't care about their customers that they're a source of revenue and that their travel experience just simply doesn't matter to the company. I have other comments to make but they're about issues that I'm not allowed to discuss."
2238,I was flying from Beijing to Pyongyang with a Tupolev 204-300. The aircraft was in an excellent state and the service was very friendly. The flight departed and arrived in time.
2239,A timewarp experience to say the least my flight from Beijing to Pyongyang was without hitch although you'd be hard pressed to find a team less interested in not only the well being but the safety of the passengers. For example when the purser was meant to make the safety announcement she looked around and saw a flight full of foreigners. As a result she actually shrugged rolled her eyes and sat right back down instead of briefing us. That it was a 30 year old Tupolev made that nagging feeling of 'I should probably listen to the safety announcement in case I jinx the flight' all the more pressing. That said the flight was a dream. The plane felt so heavy we barely realised we were touching down. The food was passable but the experience was unforgettable. Our seats tilted forwards rather than backwards. But for a 2 hour flight the sense of wonder far outweighs any actual discomfort. The stewardesses seemed more interested in reapplying thick strata of foundation and redoing their 60s overdone hairstyles than actually serving their passengers but the sight was certainly more entertaining than the sad slightly desperate propaganda movies played throughout the flight. My Air Koryo flight was a tremendous start to my trip.
2240,"PEK-FNJ return in the newer Tu-204. Check in at PEK is fast and agents seem blind to overweight/over size baggage (not mine but many others). The plane is clean and seats are comfortable with very good pitch. FA's served water apple juice and a North Korean greenish carbonated drink (soda) and the ""hamburgers"" that were brought in from FNJ. The plane departed on time and arrived into FNJ early. The plane was parked out on a taxiway and all pax were bussed to the terminal because the terminal is under construction. All arrivals and departures were handled in a temporary terminal and can only handle one flight at a time. Fortunately there are only 4 flights a day. All 7 immigration booths were open to handle about a plane load of 150 passengers. Luggage arrived about 20 minutes after we arrived at the terminal. Return FNJ-PEK was on the other Tu-204. Check in is quick and easy. I requested a window seat and got one. Again the terminal can only process one flight at a time. We had to wait in the public area while they handle an earlier flight to Vladivostok. Once the pax for that flight boarded the bus we cleared security and checked in. Check in is quick and again I requested a window seat with no problem. All pax then were bussed to the remote parking site and boarded the plane about 30 minutes before scheduled departure. The flight left 5 minutes early. Inflight experience was similar to the last flight PEK-PNJ. This flight was originally scheduled to use a smaller An-148 but was switched to a larger Tu-204-300. The plane was about 80% full."
2241,On October 31 2014 I had the unpleasant experience of traveling from JFK to DEL via Air India - the onboard service was horrendous. I was escorted in the wrong direction on boarding once I eventually got to my seat I waited almost 10 mins for someone to put my jacket away I eventually had to get up and hand the flight attendant my jacket. Very odd odour from the carpet. Requested a special meal 4 weeks in advance it was confirmed but not provided. No menu for dinner and breakfast options flight attendant walked up and down asking veg or non-veg food presentation was below par. On board movie selection was outdated - seat 8H had mechanical failure would not recline. Bathroom were dirty 6 hours into the 14 hour flight. Flight attendants provided wrong immigration paperwork causing delay in DEL.
2242,Dreamliner - Melbourne to New Delhi Oct 22nd 2014 and return 1st Nov 2014. Before flying I read the negative reports and I was concerned but the Dreamliner flights were very good. Only complaint was their movie selections did not work properly. As with all aircraft the seats are small for a larger person.
2243,After 2 flights with Jet Airways from Bangkok to India in their poor quality business class my company booked me on Air India and this was a pleasant surprise. New planes (Dreamliner) good seats fully reclining friendly and attentive attendants reasonably good food and average entertainment system a reason for me now to continue flying on Air India with the bonus of the Star Alliance mileage.
2244,London-Delhi-Sydney in Business. Was the cheapest business one-way so I didn't have too high expectations but I would use them again. London-Delhi full 777 which was well maintained and the seats spacious. Cabin crew were all very pleasant food nice if you like curry. Seat turns into a reasonable flat bed. Transit at Delhi much less painful than I feared. Lounge pretty ordinary with limited food and drink and leaking showers despite being fairly new. Flight to Sydney (via Melbourne) left an hour late and on 787 Dreamliner which was very new with more spacious seats and cabin less than 1/4 full. Food again decent curries very friendly service slept for about 8 hours. Inflight TV hopeless on both flights unless you are into Bollywood so take an iPad. Only negative was that there was a lot of confusion as to whether you need to get off in Melbourne (we did in the end) and a long wait for transit security.
2245,I have booked the flight from Australia - via Singapore Paris to Munich - besides the plane being old and the seats worn out the head set only worked on one side that the crew were not able to replace and the food below an expected standard the service extremely slow where I had to get up myself and asked several times to get a drink is not what you would expect when you pay the extra money to experience comfort to arrive on the other side of the world relaxed. I'm on my way back to Australia via Guangzhou and sitting in a so called Lounge with the present Lounge under construction and the offering is garden chairs with chips and noodle out of the packet with warm beer.
2246,"Yerevan (Armenia) - Paris. 24 June 2014 Business Class. Flight time is 5 hours 15 mins. Due to depart at 8.40am (slightly delayed). Arrive Paris 11.55am. Seat configuration economy seats with table between. Two stewardesses assigned to business class. One older and a younger. On arrival to aircraft hand towels distributed to business class passengers. No offer of refreshments as is the norm with other airlines. Older stewardess was instead busy making herself and the younger stewardess a cup of tea/coffee. Other cabin crew come and get themselves a water. In the end I got their attention and requested a juice. The other business class passengers received nothing. No assistance with putting hand luggage (small backpack) in overhead locker on landing. Clearly having difficulty due to a pinched nerve in back and was in a lot of pain. Younger stewardess helped on departure. Older stewardess wouldn't. Instead would walk past me to abruptly point out (twice) that my hand luggage needed to go back to overhead locker for landing. Breakfast of omelette. Was grey and rubbery. Unappetising. My request for a glass of wine was refused by the older stewardess as this was ""a breakfast flight so no alcohol is served"". End of flight curtains opened and business class and economy class passengers exited together to shared bus. Have yet to work out how this could have cost me almost NZ$2000. Would I travel with Air France again? No. Would I recommend this airline? No."
2247,Flight CDG to BKK AF 166 in 777300ER with 10 abreast seating. Very cramped crew were stressed and managed on a 10 hr flight between meals to come by one time only with water. Very uncomfortable bad connections of headphones and no excuse for delay. Not even 'we hope to welcome you on board of one of our flights again'. Well that explains all sad experience.
2248,PEK-FNJ-PEK 12-19 August 2014. Departed and arrived on time on both flights good FAs and great seats. Interesting airplane (TU204) and very likely the first and last time I fly a Russian built plane (not a lot operated where I spend most of my time). Flight to North-hard and bumpy landing. Back to Beijing was good - not so many turns and much smoother. Once we arrived in Pyongyang immigration took 10 mins and bags were delivered immediately. I'm glad it all went well.
2249,18 May 2013 PEK-FNJ JS 152. 25 May 2013 FNJ-PEK JS 151. Not as bad as expected. Standard level of service modern aircraft (Tu-204) similar to 757 or 320 series not any worse when comparing with some airlines of Europe or Asia. Aircraft and interior were in mint condition on time service no problems at all.
2250,I flew from Beijing to Moscow on a charter flight last month I was pleasantly surprised with the service and the joy of flying on a TU-154M. I was in business class and found it to be just fine the entertainment was a tad basic but the food and cabin crew were lovely. I would have no hesitation of flying them again.
2251,"Flew FNJ-PEK last week. Handling on ground smooth and efficient accepting a couple of kgs more weight than allowed without even a question aircraft clean and modern service friendly and with a smile both on the ground and in the air. Ok catering and a good choice of drinks given the short leg of just 1.5 hrs flight time. On time flight. I guess the bad rating comes from the ""old"" Air Koryo operating but since a while both their equipment and their attitude has changed strongly and it's another carrier now."
2252,I travelled Sydney-Hyderabad via New Delhi on 16th August 2014 and the flight was delayed by 1.5 hours and I missed my connecting flight to Hyderabad. After 2 hours I was given overnight accommodation and booked in the morning flight to Hyderabad. I had the same bizarre experience on my return flight to Sydney via New Delhi on 23/10/2014. I got a phone call a day before the flight that it has been modified and will leave couple of hours early and will go to Delhi via Vishakhapatnam. The flight from Hyderabad was delayed again by an hour due to check-in system being down which again resulted in me missing my connection to Sydney. There were 8 passengers connecting to Sydney and a notification by the captain was not good enough to save our day. It does not end here at immigration I had my departure stamp and as I was waiting for my wife and kids passports to get stamped when the Air India staff informed us that the flight to Sydney is now closed and we can't board the aircraft. It took another 4 hours to do the paperwork to cancel the departure stamp on my passport. Then the routine of going to hotel and take the flight the next day. There is no sense of customer service or sympathy at this inconvenience. I would make every effort never to fly Air India again. The only good thing about the journey was the plane itself. There is ample legroom the seats are comfortable and the dreamliner 787 windows are dimmed to give night experience. Flight staff service varies person to person - some are good and others indifferent. Overall do not fly Air India if you don't have the buffer time to offset for these delays.
2253,I travelled to Bangkok from Delhi on 12th Oct'14. The flight was delayed by 1.5 hours but we somehow managed that delay. My return flight was on 23rd Oct'14 - the flight was delayed by 5 hours. I had to catch next flight (after 2 hours) from Delhi to Lucknow on the same day. I had to literally beg them to transfer me to another flight. I don't understand why Air India flights are always delayed and other airlines are always on time. They have got good aircraft but there attitude towards passengers and time management needs to be improved.
2254,Peak Season flight-AI 602 last night. Our original flight was the late night 11pm flight which was delayed by an hour or so. We requested the airline staff at the airport to change us to an earlier flight due to this delay. In spite of the flight being totally packed they were kind enough to accommodate us on the 9pm flight. As for the flight it was great we had premium economy seats great food on time good service and a no-bumps ride. Also not to mention one of the most engaging pilot who gave us stats on every single item relating to the flight-it just felt good!
2255,Flew in March April Sept Oct 2014 between UK and Delhi. I would recommend AI but carry your own food. Timely. Good flights. Choice and quality of food / drinks unsatisfactory. Cannot explain why food was of such poor quality - stale fruit poor presentation. Rescheduled my departure from Delhi without a problem.
2256,Paris - Casablanca. Very comfortable the crew were excellent! The food was quite good not the best I have eaten but still good for an airline. The flight was smooth like the landing. I would recommend Air France to every one who wants a great level of comfort and a high level of service.
2257,Flew Air France flight 0007 which is a JFK-CDG flight. Flight departed on time boarding times were good considering that the plane was an A380 (still however if you do not like waiting to board on long lines then I suggest you take one of their several other daily flights). Food was free and decent legroom was pretty good. Crew were friendly and professional. My baggage arrived in CDG with the flight. Didn't have to pay for my first checked bag (I would suggest trying to fit everything into one however as the second bag is expensive). My only complaint is that I had checked in online and only had to drop off a bag at JFK's check-in desks but the line was huge and it was not apparent that there was a separate line for people like me. Overall a very good trip - it was also the cheapest ticket for the flight.
2258,"Recently flew Bogota-Paris-Amsterdam-Paris-Bogota. The long-haul BOG-CDG was terrible. The A-340-300 was not as tidy as one could expect and IFE was deplorable. I couldn't watch movies because anytime I pressed the obsolete screen it would appear ""veuillez patienter"". On top of that this flight had a 45 minute delay so I lost my connection to AMS. Fortunately ground staff at CDG were polite and booked me another flight later that day and provided me a 20-euro meal voucher. CDG-AMS was nothing special FAs were quick and not-so-kind at serving snacks and beverages. My return flight was in Premium Economy and things really improved here. FAs were extremely kind and smiling. However I waited more than 40 minutes for my bag even though I had a priority sticker. Conclusion of this review: Don't fly Air France if your travelling Economy. Choose it if you book Premium."
2259,Warsaw-Paris-Montreal and return Minneapolis-Paris Mixed reviews really the crew were pretty friendly and service was spotty. Food from Paris was really good and quite poor from the US to Paris. Decent French wines champagne and Spirits from MSP. Weirdly I was told that they only had wine and port for flights to Montreal. Service from CDG-YUL was a joke not even a drink served until we were over Irish airspace such a disorganized serving of dinner it was laughable. Attendants were stumbling over them selves serving trays and than I just got one passed to me from behind with no words or choices but it was very tasty and the portions were just right. All other requests were self-serving. The 777-300 was horrible no legroom and very cramped A340 old and falling apart but much more comfortable with the exception of the middle 4 seats they were empty but fixed armrests prevented you from getting comfortable and sleeping flat. Bring a book or ipad as the IFE on the A340 is rubbish. I would fly again if the price is right don't expect too much and you might get lucky.
2260,On both legs (Beijing - Pyongyang - Beijing) the plane was a more than decent TU 204 with a reasonable seat pitch. Check in fast and efficient both at Pyongyang and Beijing: check in staff also turned a blind eye of a 2 kgs excess I had on both legs. This airline is an experience in itself: propaganda is on air during the whole flight with DPRK music. Complimentary inflight service with local both soft and alcoholic drinks. Deplaning at Pyongyang fast with rapid baggage delivery: in less than 30 minutes I was on my way (escorted by guides) to the hotel.
2261,Beijing (PEK) to Pyongyang (FNJ) return 22-24 August in economy. PEK to FNJ was on a newish and very clean two class TU-204 with decent seat pitch in economy drop down inflight entertainment and efficient service (economy bulkhead is row 4 first exit row with extra legroom is row 7). Catering consisted of the infamous Air Koryo 'hamburger' containing some kind of mystery meat and a choice of alcoholic or soft drink. Inflight entertainment consisted of clips from classical music performances and the obligatory state propaganda about the DPRK. Although there are headphone sockets none are given out (music plays throughout the cabin). Smooth landing but long taxiing time in Pyongyang. FNJ to PEK was on an older one class TU-204 with slightly less legroom but the service was the same - short propaganda piece inflight music and catering with the dreaded Air Koryo 'hamburger'. FAs are reasonably efficient if a bit robotic with adequate English skills (better than China Eastern for example). Quick check-in procedures in both Beijing and Pyongyang. Requested (and given) a window seat on both flights. No issues with luggage although baggage delivery in Pyongyang is painfully slow (allow 45 minutes or so waiting time). Overall a decent effort. The 1 star classification is unjustified - based on my experiences Air Koryo is somewhere between 2 and 3 stars overall. Catering and safety procedures need to be improved - tray tables were down and cabin baggage blocking access during take off.
2262,Honestly can't fault Air Koryo - their 1-star rating is completely unjustified. I've had worse flights on Malaysia Airlines Turkish Airlines and British Airways. I flew PEK-FNJ on a modern Tupolev-204 and both check-in and boarding were faultless. We departed on time and the cabin crew were courteous. Free food and drinks were served and the safety demonstration was very professional. Once we arrived in Pyongyang immigration took 10 mins and bags were delivered immediately. I'd definitely use them again.
2263,PEK-FNJ on their brand-new Antonov An-148. Courteous and professional cabin crew served a lavish hot meal with several different savoury items in little plastic dishes - fish chicken salad plus a main of chicken curry plus dessert bread roll tea cider or beer. Landed on time and formalities to enter North Korea went very quickly. FNJ-PRK on their Tupolev Tu-204-100 wasn't as smooth boarding started early but a small hitch checking in a passenger with an oversize bag halted check in for over half an hour while staff dithered. This resulted in a departure an hour late which wasn't made up in the air and I missed my connection to the US necessitating a 24h stay in Beijing. Since I was originally only going to be in transit and not enter China Air Koryo's PEK staff had to rebook me before I could enter China which took about an hour. The change fee I incurred on my flight to the US was Â£300 of which Air Koryo contributed $100. Delays happen but this one was so easily avoided. Will definitely fly Air Koryo again as they are a very interesting airline compared to the competition (Air China) and have a vastly better onboard product but will be prepared for the odd burst of eccentric behaviour such as this.
2264,New Delhi to Srinagar and back. While in the past I have had reservations about flying Air India I found their overall performance better than I had previously anticipated and expected. There are two newer perks with flying Air India. The first is the new Terminal 3 at New Delhi which is modern efficient and clean a huge improvement over the previous Delhi airport. Flying in an out is a breeze with the newer terminal offering a large selection of amenities. The second is the membership of Air India with the Star Alliance making earning frequent flier points possible. The DEL-SXR sector was served by an older A320 - comfortable seats in one class configuration with no special amenities in an older layout. Service consisted of hot beverages with biscuits - not exemplary but adequate for a short flight. Srinagar had been affected by floods at the time of my departure so the Air India staff graciously allowed us to leave the city three days before our scheduled departure. The plane was a A330 with modern seats offering excellent legroom with tasty refreshments. The aircraft sported a modern looking interior with restrooms under the main cabin - something I had not seen before - with no inflight entertainment but perfectly adequate for a short flight. Air India may be one of the more underrated airlines out there. Despite its financial difficulties their inflight product has improved markedly over the years and their Star Alliance membership and modern hub in Delhi makes them attractive to fly with both on short haul and long haul flights. My expectations were low but I was more than satisfied and I would consider flying with them again.
2265,AI 667/668 between BOM-TRV-BOM. A319. Check-in quick and efficient. Flights clean and comfortable. On time one way slightly delayed the other. Good breakfast service cabin crew helpful. Quickly disembarked both times. No complaints. Ticket was about 35% cheaper than the nearest competitor.
2266,I travel Air India 3-4 times a year. This time I was travelling from Delhi (DEL) to Kochi (KOX) on an A320 the seats were not comfortable at all. The TV on the flight was not working. The food was horrible.
2267,Flew BHX to CDG (return). Outward trip pretty ordinary but no significant complaints. Thought it took a master stroke of organisation by Air France to seat myself and wife (pensioners) in 8A and B and to pre-board a severely disabled gentleman in 8C who was completely unable physically to move to allow us access to our seats. No complaint to him he was great but climbing into our seats and out at CDG we did wonder how we were expected to cope. Overall a very basic experience.
2268,Flew from LAX-CDG on the A380. We were in the second Business Class cabin on the upper deck. We had a very handsome friendly all-male crew who provided a nice if not amazing service on the 11-hour flight. Seats are not lie flat but still very comfortable affording me a long sleep. The food was good if unmemorable. The IFE provided a decent selection but is not comprehensive enough to be competitive with the top airlines. Overall this was a nice flight. There was nothing too spectacular about it but I would fly in Business with them again (especially now that they are upgrading to lie-flat seats).
2269,Not as lucky as the last writer here. Travelled on an ancient Ilyushin aircraft and whilst happy to reach my destination this is not an airline I would use again (no choice this time on my schedule to Pyongyang). This plane was not maintained well from the surface appearance in the cabin and many seat mechanisms also were broken. Cabin staff had a fixed smile on boarding and whilst they gave out a meal tray they could not speak or understand English and appeared to rather poorly trained. Food was as expected I guess but the quality was well below all Asian airlines I have ever flown and think it was the cheapest meal ever sampled on a plane.
2270,Flew a total 8 sectors between Beijing Pyongyang Chongjin and Sondok onboard IL-62 IL-18 Tu-134 and Tu-204. Flights were all on time. Good English spoken onboard and a full meal service on 1.5 hours between Beijing to Pyongyang. All baggage delivered promptly with no delays. Planes are maintained well.
2271,Only flew internal flights (3 legs) on AN-24. Drinks (beer or cider) provided on the 2 longer legs. No IFE. FAs spoke reasonable English and were friendly. No safety demonstration and the overhead bins were just overhead shelves. I like the way you can push the empty seats all the way forward (so they lie flat) in a half-empty plane it's a good option for more leg room! There is no choice flying domestic in DPRK but Air Koryo provided good entertainment.
2272,The Dreamliner flight from Sydney to Delhi was a disappointment. 1) Seats were very cramped. Not adequate leg space for such a long flight. 2) Toilets were dirty and toilet tissues were not replaced. 3) The entire economy seating area smelt. 4) A snack and a drink was very much needed before landing. Just two meals for a 13 hour flight was not adequate. 5) Fruit juice and diet drinks were not available after the first meal service. 6) A wet wipe or steamed towel should have been provided at the end of such along flight. We had to disembark even without being able to freshen up. Definitely not up to international standards.
2273,"CDG-SYD (via DEL and MEL). Check-in was a mess at CDG - told to leave executive line and wait to the side - then told to get back in to executive class line after waiting for several minutes to the side. AI use Cathay lounge for this flight at terminal 2C and its really nice. 787 Dreamliner for both legs. My overall impression is that this plane is massively over hyped from a customer aspect anyway - there is really nothing special about this plane - the windows are the most noticeable difference- and while this is nice during the couple of minutes during taking off and landing - you don't notice it for the rest of the flight. Everything is plastic on this plane - the toilet door feels like an ice cream container lid. The seat is comfortable in bed mode it is wide and well padded - but there is no Z-mode for relaxation - you can put the backrest back and the footrest up but the seat remains flat at all times - its not really that comfortable for relaxing/watching TV. A sat in cushion and a larger cotton pillow are provided - which are very comfortable in addition to a duvet and a thin blanket - which makes a great sleeping experience. IFE screen is large and high definition - there is a reasonable choice of (both Indian and Western) movies and television shows - but not quite enough to stretch out for the 12 hour flight. Food was variable. No menus provided - options were stated by staff at the time of meal service. Out of CDG the supper was lobster with champagne sauce - it was dry and tough - but definitely still lobster which is great in business class. Otherwise all the other meals were curry and sandwiches were offered on the Melbourne to Sydney leg - really this should be a proper breakfast. An announcement was made that no alcohol could be served on the domestic leg from MEL to SYD - what they actually mean is no duty free alcohol can be served - its pretty cheap to stop serving alcohol just because you have to pay the duty on it. Almost all passengers immediately removed their shoes and socks immediately upon boarding - so be prepared for the feet. The staff are a mixed bunch - some are fantastic - friendly smiling communicative and anticipating requests - these staff were all female. Unfortunately the male staff were some of the most surly resentful and unpleasant people I have ever encountered in a business class cabin - attendant call button was met with a ""yes"" and a glare from these men. The lounge at Delhi was interesting - I was there at from 9-12 am this is a big lounge with many comfortable chairs but limited food and drink options. Showers were available. Wifi was difficult to access staff seemed disinterested and resentful of requests for assistance - there is clearly no customer service mentality about this place. Overall this was a very average experience and certainly the worst business class flight I have ever taken - however the price was very reasonable and I would consider booking it again and I would cautiously recommend Air India."
2274,"Trying to get to Delhi from Bombay for a 6pm wedding. Our 1pm flight - cancelled till 2.30pm. 2.30pm flight - told at counter it was over-booked and is now full. The next available flight is at 5pm - delayed till 5.20pm without prior notice. 5.45pm - begin takeoff procedures. 5.55pm - electrical failure. Plane comes to a standstill. Lights and AC continue to be switched on and off. 6pm - captain announces ""there has been an electrical failure and out technical team is on their way to trouble-shoot"". No further explanation offered. No beverages offered. If you got up to ask for water they did oblige by giving you one small glass. 6.45pm - herded like animals and packed like sardines onto a stationary bus on the tarmac. When asked what was happening and where we were going we were told ""nowhere. you can not stand on the tarmac so you must sit on the bus and wait while we do final checks onboard. The buses were over-packed and we were locked inside while staff and drivers disappeared. 7.15pm - finally start to re-board passengers. We decide not to get back onto an aircraft that has electrical failures. We demanded our luggage and a full refund. The ground staff obliged however sent us wondering around the airport unescorted in search of the duty manager. This whole process took until 8pm. After 7 hours all delays and cancellations sitting around the airport on the plane on buses and being spoken to in a patronising manner by everyone from ground staff to on-flight staff we did not end up flying to Delhi and we have missed our friends wedding. I will never fly with or recommend Air India."
2275,Traveled on New Delhi to Dubai sector AI 995 on brand new B787 Dreamliner. Check in was easy and hassle free. Boarding too went smoothly. Flight departed 10 minutes early. Aircraft was brand new fresh. Cabin was spacious and seating arrangement was a comfortable 3-3-3 layout. Contrary to expectation the seat width was not wide enough and there was a general discomfort in seating. Inflight entertainment was excellent with a wide range of movies and shows. There were 5 regional movies available in my native language an experience never found in any other flights. Food as usual was very good though the crew were asking passengers whether they are strict vegetarians as they were running out of veg meals due many passengers pre ordered veg meals. Landed 20 minutes before scheduled arrival time. The overall travel experience was excellent and B787 Dreamliner is one perfect aircraft to fly.
2276,Went to Oslo via Paris by Air France from Canada. Two Stops: Both had delays. One overnight due to maintenance issues. They managed to lose my luggage as well. The service was the worst I have had. Will never fly Air France again.
2277,My wife and I flew with our adult children and grandchildren (5 and 21 months old) on the 6th of June YYZ-CDG and 16th of June CDG-YYZ. On board service was impeccable crew were extremely helpful resourceful and friendly. Even the meals - especially on the CDG-YYZ flight - was above normal airline food. A further plus was the good air- quality on board. Best flights to and from Europe we have had!
2278,CDG-SGN. This flight was a codeshare booked through Vietnam airlines for a very good price. We were able to select seats by checking in on the Air France website which was easy to use. Check in at CDG was a nightmare - I don't think I've waited this long for economy check-in - the fact that this was business class (in the sky priority area) made it really bad. There seemed to be about 6 counters open for all of Air France business class at CDG (hundreds of people - huge line snaking on for ever). No priority pass for customs/security. Lounge was good (see separate review). 777-200ER plane full in business. Service was excellent - excellent staff polite and efficient. I quite like the seat - although its not horizontal quite comfy for lounging some minor acrobatics had to be performed if you are not on the aisle and need to get over someone who is fully stretched out. Food was acceptable for plane food although they did run out of my choice (sitting in 4K). Champagne was delicious (Ayala) and they set up a self service bar in the galley - very much preferred to constantly pressing the call button. No priority pass given for customs at SGN. Although this flight was not perfect the 11 hours went by in a flash and I had a great time and would not hesitate to recommend Air France.
2279,Flew Beijing-Pyongyang (IL-62M) Pyongyang-Samjiyon return (Tu-134) Pyongyang-Hamhung return (IL-18) Pyongyang-Beijing (Tu-204) as well as 3 other flights on their An-24RV IL-76 and Mi-8 helicopter. I was on an organized aviation tour and we had not one problem on the whole trip. While all but the Tu-204 were ancient Soviet aircraft they were in immaculate condition. Every flight left on time with most arriving ahead of schedule. The crew's attitudes varied from flight to flight with some being better than others. Food was only given out on the international sectors and I must admit was revolting. IFE was also extremely poor and only available on their two Tupolev Tu-204 aircraft. All they showed us was a North Korean concert which was on a loop. While it didn't bother me too much on our 2 hour flight from Pyongyang to Beijing it would have driven me insane if I was flying to some of their other destinations such as Kuala Lumpur or Bangkok.
2280,SHE-FNJ-SHE in Economy class. On the way to Pyongyang it was an old aircraft check in at Shenyang airport was smooth and check in at Korean air counter. Boarding was fine staff on board helpful and friendly. Due to the air conditioning the cabin was full of fog. There was a lot of condensation. No food for 1.5 hours flight to Pyong Yang. Check in at Pyong Yang was easy because there were not many flights at all. Departure and arrival are sharing same hall. One room for everything but very efficient. On the way back to Shenyang was new TU204 very modern aircraft. Food was served (a hamburger). Would recommend for the experience of the old aircraft (one off experience). I would fly again with the new aircraft in the future.
2281,Beijing to Pyongyang return. The plane was clean and well presented. Check-in service was impersonal but satisfactory. The food was good. Both flights left and arrived right on time. A shame the airline doesn't fly more routes.
2282,FNY-PEK as part of an organised tour. The aircraft used was one of the newer Tupolevs. Good points. Check- in assisted by our 'minder' ensured that all luggage went through with no problems. Seating was better than some other aircrafts flown food - although only a snack was more than adequate for a short journey (and provided free). FA's were efficient and any reasonable needs were complied with. However the IFE consisted of the same propaganda film shown in the airport and must have been on an endless loop. The flight left earlier than my agenda showed although we got there in ample time I was not notified of any change. We were advised that there was no Business Class - there was and for most of us this would have been the preferred option. Overall I believe Air Koryu is a reasonable airline to fly and would not hesitate to use them again.
2283,I flew Air Koryo as part of an organized tour in and out of DPRK planes were new TU204s. The planes were clean and plenty of overhead luggage space crew was pleasant and efficient food okay for a short flight. The overall experience was better than some airlines with 2 and 3 star ratings.
2284,Booked just a day early on AI to take the very early morning flight from DEL to MUM last week. Very reasonable fare (even for last min) great aircraft 787 and good service.
2285,Took a late night flight on AI from DEL to BOM recently. Aircraft was a 321 and the flight was over booked. Yet service was excellent great food. The aircraft was in decent condition. Flight slightly bumpy but that can be blamed on the rains around Mumbai.
2286,Flying to the Maldives via Mumbai from Ahmedabad on Sept 14th. Checked in and were told flight was on time. We were to have a 5 hour break in Mumbai giving us plenty of time to catch connection on Sri Lanka Airways. The flight never arrived and was 4 hours late taking off although AI personnel insisting we would make our connection. Never did no help from AI personnel in Mumbai and worst experience on a flight ended up in transit at the airport for over 26 hours.
2287,Rigolet Labrador to Goose Bay Labrador on 13 October 2013 on an Air Labrador twin Otter. Aircraft has been well used over the years but provided a comfortable and quick way back to Goose Bay. Bush flying co-pilot loaded and unloaded the bags seating - well- wherever there is an empty seat. No complaints about the service and would not hesitate to fly with them again.
2288,Low marks because of incredible run-around re: trying to add bags to booking (willing to pay and website indicated this was possible) - and even after paying were told by clueless agent at AF at RAK/Marrakech airport (who didn't know how to process vouchers) that we had to pay 200 euros for 3 bags - it took a kind manager to get this taken care of in the middle of the bedlam of checking in (not much respect for queuing). The flight itself was OK but nothing great - our meal on a 2.5 hour flight was a plastic-wrapped sandwich (albeit with tasty fresh bread) and no alcohol served - service was friendly and helpful was my first flight with AF and probably the last.
2289,Flew from Toronto to Heathrow via Paris. Purchased Business Class tickets for my wife and I and we were not disappointed. We had flown Air France Business Class once before and love the service and enjoy being able to sit next to each other. I find the seats comfortable despite not being fully lie flat. The lounge in Paris has wonderful showers.
2290,LHR-CDG-HAV and HAV-CDG-LHR. Going was a pretty new 777-300. Main meal was good however usual terrible Air France breakfast of some hard bread and tea/coffee. Seats were OK nothing special. Stop in CDG was poor as usual not the airline's fault though. CDG is the worst designed overpriced airport I have ever been to. Coming back slightly older 777 with no USB port which was annoying. Very uncomfortable seats couldn't really get into any sleeping position. Service is almost non existent apart from meal times and one or two drinks rounds. You have to get yourself to the back of the plane and help yourself to drinks and ice cream but they don't tell you this so if you don't know then no drinks for you!
2291,Beijing to Sunan International an experience to fly their IL-62 it was back in time. Food was good and service efficient. As North Koreans travel with lots and lots of baggage it was placed all over the plane. Plane on time in Sunan but waited more than 1 hour for our baggage.
2292,PEK-FNJ New TU204 seats relatively comfortable service friendly meal standard economy meal. Pyongyang Times and Korea Today newspapers which keep first-time DPRK visitor busy for the flight.
2293,"PEK-FNJ on Tu-204. Check in quick and efficient at PEK. Clean new aircraft seating reasonably comfortable and adequate for 2 hour trip. Was served bland meal but no worse than many other economy class meals. Service was efficient but cold drinks offered and free English language DPRK ""literature"". Entertaining pre-take off video with politics included and inflight video showed happy images of the DPRK. Quite reasonable flight noticeable that all non-Koreans were in the front economy cabin - with the back cabin full of Koreans. Pre- take off and touchdown were marked by the happy playful music of an electronic band eerie but very much part of the DPRK experience. I was pleased to land given the safety reputation."
2294,PEK-FNJ-PEK in business class on new Tu-204. The seats were quite spacious and airplane comfortable. I thought it really odd that they served a huge meal PEK-FNJ but only bread on the return. The flight attendants were decent enough though English skills were lacking. There was access to the Air China lounge at PEK T2. I didn't visit the lounge on the return at FNJ. On the flight PEK-FNJ there were no more seats so a North Korean teenager sat in the flight attendant jump seat for the whole flight. On the way back the security guard sat in the flight attendant jump seat and she sort of sat on the very edge of the same jump seat and held the wall for take off and landing. They also kept the curtains closed to the front of the aircraft which in the event of an evacuation would be a no-no because people couldn't see to get to the exit.
2295,PEK-FNJ. Interesting to say the least. Outbound was oldest plane I have ever seen in my life (Il-62) and literally falling apart at the seams. Propaganda handed out announcements regarding how this flight was made possible by the dear leader etc. Return was same aircraft type but much better shape. However upon landing in Beijing was quickly sweating due to no air conditioning. Not like you have much of a choice when flying to Pyongyang - snag Air China if you want a safe flight but Air Koryo if you want the experience.
2296,I was excited to be travelling on Air India's new 'Dreamliner' from Sydney to Delhi yesterday. The experience fell well short of my expectations. I endeavoured to do on-line check-in but it was not available so I phoned and requested an aisle set. That request was never registered but the check-in assistant in Sydney gave me an exit row seat which I was very happy with. On the flight the entertainment system for my seat 30C was not working. I initially complained but I was dismissed by the first flight attendant and told I would need to wait for it to cut in. After an hour of waiting I approached another flight attendant who assured me he would re-set the system. Following another few failed attempts I was assured that they would register the fact that it wasn't working and that it would fixed for the next passenger. Not sure how that helped me! When it came time for meal- time the flight attendant asked me to pull out my tray and was irritated when I couldn't. The tray was actually broken. She did endeavour to fix it but it remained a problem throughout the flight. Unfortunately the entertainment system appears to control the overhead lighting as well. The result was that I had no access to movies music or reading light for the full flight which is 12 hrs 30 minutes that's a long time to sit in the dark. There was no apology or understanding from staff. The food was very basic with little variety there was minimal genuine service on the flight. Staff seemed to vanish between meals and seemed irritated when a passenger asked for something. If anything I found some of the staff quite rude. This was a very full flight I think staff need to pay some attention to the toilets during the trip. At one stage one of the toilet basins was clogged and another passenger complained to staff. I do a lot of travel and this is the worst flights I have taken. I would endeavour never to fly Air India again but from Sydney to Delhi there is very little choice of operators. Hopefully Air India will develop a true sense of service before my next trip.
2297,August 2014 - Flew the Dreamliner from Paris to Delhi. The departure was on-time and arrival in Delhi was 20 minutes before time. The aircraft looked new seats were comfortable cabin crew was efficient and had nice smiles on their faces (much more welcoming than many other airlines in my experience). Food was good in-flight entertainment offered a lot of choice although it was slightly heavier in terms of Bollywood stuff. Decent sized blankets in this era of cost-saving with most other airlines offering half-sized blankets! Baggage arrived on the belt in Delhi minutes after landing. All in all a very positive experience and I'll definitely fly Air India again.
2298,JFK-DEL on 3 Aug and BOM-JFK on 23 Aug. Cabin crew disappear during the night. On other airlines they walk through the cabin a few times with glasses of water for passengers. Not on AI. I discovered that they put out cookies sandwiches and soft drinks for passengers in one of the galleys but there was no announcement made. No drinks were offered on the BOM-JFK flight.
2299,CDG-SNG wrote a less than complimentary review 3 weeks ago when flew the other way. This trip better - main issue is just age of seats cramped cabin and mean amenities eg: no paper cups in toilets often no paper towels only tissues. AV is very poor quality and selection. Staff very pleasant food on this leg was better than ex Singapore.
2300,PVG-CDG on A380 flight delayed 1 hour due to traffic control at Shanghai Pudong Airport. Economy class seat is so hard and uncomfortable food awful cabin crew friendly bit they just disappeared after meal service can't believe that they just served beverage once for entire 12 hrs flight! Inflight entertainment is good.
2301,GIG-CDG-LIS AF443 Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon via Paris Charles de Gaulle Boeing 777-300ER brand new aircraft friendly cabin crew very poor seat comfort for an 11 hour overnight transatlantic flight. Just 2 meals during the flight after 2 hours all the crew disappear to go and have a rest on the back of the plane as you see them 3 hours prior to landing waking up and tidy up themselves. They just give you a poor amount of juices and no food at all just ice creams. IFE very good and a good selection of movies as the screen is big enough. Very poor seat comfort in economy you hardly can pull down your chair. Overall is a good value for price flying with Air France don't expect something excellent. They should look after the standards followed by KLM as they are in a partnership which is an excellent choice for a long haul flights!
2302,PEK-FNJ on old Tupolev 154. Professional if solemn crew but decent flight and lots of food.
2303,Round trip PEK-FNJ. New Tupolev plane. Service inflight entertainment and food excellent. A clean and comfortable plane comfortable seats and professional flight crew.
2304,Beijing to Pyongyang and return and could enjoy the new Tupolev planes of Air Koryo. The business class is very small (8 seats but comfortable with good seats). Stewardesses attentive entertainment is miserable and so is the food. Anyhow the Tupolevs bring a huge improvement to the image of Air Koryo.
2305,I took a round trip of Beijing to Pyongyang - Il-62 and Tu-154 aircraft - and the experience was to say the least memorable. As I was sat quite far back in the Il-62 it was right next to the engines and I'll never forget the feeling of impending dread and doom as we descended down to Sunan Airport. We landed safely. The food was satisfactory with chicken curry beef with rice some melon-esque vegetable bread and dessert. Seats were nice but it was slightly cramped. The luggage space was limited and there was no cover to prevent it from falling off. There were North Korean magazines and a North Korean newspaper (Pyongyang Daily) up for grabs too on a meal cart. The return to Beijing was on the Tu-154 : sitting a few rows behind Business class the flight was very comfortable. We did feel hungrier this time as there was no food service coupled with delays hovering over Beijing due to busy traffic at the Airport.
2306,PEK to FNJ roundtrip on Ilyushin 62--The flight was only 1.5 hours. Aircraft was very old-looking and used. I had to work hard at attaching my safety belt. The fabric on the seats was old and frayed. The crew was very perfunctory in their duties but still polite and civil. The crew was not service oriented nor did it seem inclined to be. Not a bad experience but nothing to standout in my mind.
2307,Newark to Calcutta and back. I figured there is a reason why the tickets were cheaper than other airlines. After all you get what you pay for. But I have to admit after traveling to Calcutta and coming back to the US that I am quite satisfied with the service offered by Air India. Staff were courteous professional helpful and food was excellent. The only complaint I have is the seat quality the seats are extremely uncomfortable almost felt like I was sitting on a piece of wood during the lengthier legs of the flight (Newark to Mumbai Mumbai to Newark). Seat quality is very important especially for a 16 hour duration flight. Surprisingly the seats were roomier and a bit more comfortable on the flight from Mumbai to Calcutta. I wish it worked the other way round. Air India is known for delays but no complaints there either in fact we arrived early from Mumbai from Newark.
2308,DEL to GOI via BOM. Tatty old A321 that looked liked it hadn't been properly clean since being brought into service 20 years ago. Washroom basin filthy with brown stains everywhere. Surly crew who were mannerless. Cramped uncomfortable seats. No alcohol or soft drinks available on either legs. Sat on plane at Mumbai whilst plane serviced for 40 minutes - terribly unprofessional ground crew cleaning the plane around you.
2309,We were on flight from BLR-BOM-JDH. The flight was on-time entertainment systems were working properly the crew was polite lunch was satisfactory. Aircraft A319 seemed new and comfortable.
2310,Flew from Chicago to Delhi the leg room in the airplane was good but its a poorly maintained aircraft. The entire plane was dirty. One of the toilets were not working. The snacks were not served you had to walk to the back of the aircraft to find a sandwich and a drink. Horrible experience.
2311,"Arrived in EZE with LH on first class and connecting to MVD with AF In C class and no F available but bags never arrived sorry attitude at airport in MVD and once I obtained their little paper proving I never got my bags got to their website to make the complaint messy website it worked after a lot of effort and phone calls. Checked in a few weeks later MVD to Fra via EZE to TLV 1st class Check in agent said ""no computer says no"" could not believe AF bags could not be check in all the way through although same reservation system. Vile attitude had to re-route my flight with LH via Sao lost my C ticket MVD to EZE and used TAM instead."
2312,Flew MAD-CDG-YUL and return back to Lisbon. The first impression on arrival at the Madrid airport early in the morning was terrible. Complete chaos people standing in 3 queues pushing around and arguing with staff. I must say there were only 3 persons wearing Air France uniforms. They were rude not attentive at all returning you to another queue as there were other flight checking in before our flight at 7am to Paris. We flew business class but were not allowed to go directly to the Premium counter nobody really checked our tickets. Some staff were chit chatting instead of helping other customers. At boarding another chaos no proper staff there either. The flight was delayed and we arrived just in time to rush to our gate for the flight to Montreal. CDG is so big and the staff there so difficult so slow and we were asked for passports 4 times! The long haul flight was ok food was ok and the IFE was ok. Nothing special and nothing to be mentioned. Considering expensive business fare I would expect much more. Lounge in Madrid was poor the one in Paris OK and on return the Montreal lounge was again just OK. Will try Swiss next time.
2313,Overnight flight from Haneda to Tokyo. OK flight. Wire to headphones broken so could not use the inflight system - Head of Cabin very embarrassed but just nothing they could do onboard and full flight so could not move. My complaint was regarding the food - totally overcooked / burnt dish that was not edible. Crew seemed to be well aware but could not do much about it as most dishes seemed to have been forgotten in the oven too long. Not the first time this happens to me on Air France and quite a petty as their main courses are normally quite good.
2314,Flew SIN-CDG CDG-SIN. Good flights. The 2x3x2 layout is poor and the seat is almost flat. Some bumps in the seat when fully reclined and only a thin blanket provided. However I did sleep on both flights. Service was good. Didn't have dinner leaving Singapore so cannot comment but had excellent food on leaving Paris. CDG lounge was spacious with two levels making it seem less crowded. Little choice of food and no hot food. The cold food provided was good. Lovely spacious showers and facial treatment by Clarins beauty therapist was a treat so long as you have time to to sign up for it.
2315,Delhi-Kolkata-Delhi. Delhi-Kolkata (CCU) on Airbus A321. Kolkata-Delhi on Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. Both flights were on time and aircraft's were considerably clean. Check in (both times) took hardly 5 minutes. IFE on A321 was not good but B787 had great collection of movies and music however most of earphones provided were broken (carry your own earphone). Food was a complete let down on both flights and staff did little to make your journey better. Overall for 2 hour flights Air India is a good option given its price. Also Air India and Jet Airways operate from Terminal 3 in Delhi which makes airport experience slightly better than other domestic airlines.
2316,EWR-BOM-AMD. Flight was supposed to depart on 3 July 2014 I flew on 5th July. Everything went well until take off there was a problem with the air-conditioning which was not resolved at all. After 4.5 hours we were told to get off the plane. After getting our baggage we were told to stand in a queue for 40 mins to get hotel vouchers and after getting the voucher I was waited for the hotel transportation for 3 hours. We were 54 passengers and there was only 1 bus which could carry 34 passengers. Back to the airport for 11 am next day told to stand in line for another flight which was at 4 pm on 4 July 2014. After standing in line for 4 hours I was told the flight was full and another was scheduled for 8. Boarded the flight and after 2 hrs we were told that there was problem with the engine and it took them another 4 hours to decide that we had to get off the plane again another motel was given. Spoke to a manager of Air India and they got me on 5th July's AI 190 EWR-BOM-AMD flight. Finally on 5th July I arrived home 72 hours late. I have decided not to fly Air India in the future.
2317,CDG-YUL. Return flight from Paris to Montreal by Air France last month. Both flights were just very good. Excellent service tasty food friendly staff and decent comfort. The service of Air France is really significantly better In comparison with competitors on this route like Air Canada and Air Transat. I will recommend this route of Air France to everyone who wants basic comfort during the travel.
2318,JFK-CDG on 05/06/2014 and then CDG-JFK on 05/20/2014. Both flights were very smooth with minimal turbulence during both flights. Staff service on both flights were very good. Dinner snacks and drinks were served in a timely fashion. Seats were comfortable. On the return flight two rows ahead of me were vacant so a few of us were moved into them to break up the row and give us more space. I chose the Italian dinner from the A La Carte menu. Much tastier than dinners I've had on other airlines. Solid selection of Movies/TV/Music and the headphones provided were good quality. One of the better airlines I've flown with. Very positive experience.
2319,We flew from Atlanta to Paris. From the minute we entered the international terminal in Atlanta GA to the minute we left Paris on an Air Austria flight bound for Vienna I have nothing but wonderful things to say about AF. The staff in Atlanta went beyond their job description to make our check in and transition to the jet as perfect as it could be. Yes the food isn't gourmet but it was hot tasty and filling. We had a decent Merlot and our stewardess served us each 2 little bottles of VSOP Cognac. The cabin was clean and comfortable. A great selection of movies. There was more leg room than on domestic flights. Service was kind and considerate. The cabin was darkened and it was quiet and easy to rest. We were served a basic fruit/coffee/muffin breakfast nothing fancy but it was OK. All in all the best thing about AF is the people.
2320,Flew the Dreamliner from Singapore to Frankfurt via Delhi. They had their new (plated) catering on board but still the choice and quality disappointing and the service average which is a shame as Indian food can be outstanding even the curry option was very disappointing. The cabin crew in business on whole do not seem comfortable or confident and are usually older. I mention the age issue only because I think that they have been used to a different type of service which no longer is the standard for business class. I appears that the business cabin crew are chosen on seniority and Air India needs to change this and use younger crew who can bring a new attitude and freshness to the service. Having said that the seat for sleeping was excellent with nice large pillows and good quality cotton quilts. The Dreamliner definitely delivers a much better cabin comfort and had a major affect on jet lag. We had 1.5 hr scheduled transit in Delhi which was a worry we ended up with 60 mins to complete the transfer which we did ok as we had already been issued boarding passes in Singapore. Having said that value for money is excellent. I know many have disliked the decor and I have to agree that it doesn't come up to Cathay's but its ok. If they can just up their game with cabin crew and food Air India could become a great airline.
2321,Flew Tel Aviv to Paris 5/26/14. Unbelievably awful. Not updated. Cramped seats same as coach but with a few inches more leg room. Only reclined a few inches. Can't lie down. Hard to get out from window seat. Food wasn't good. No wine. Really it was awful. What a complete waste. I can't believe they got away with calling it Business Class. I hear they are upgrading but I won't be back.
2322,NCL-CDG-BOG-CDG-NC.L Decent fare during Air France sale and added benefit of avoiding overnight stay in MAD or transit through PTY with KLM. A little apprehensive after reading a few past reviews. Air France treat you excellently in Affaires and it does feel a little like business class used to be - something special. Short hop from Newcastle on time - nice breakfast served and CityJet crew couldn't have been nicer. We'd been warned about transit at CDG with most saying that 90 mins 'wasn't nearly enough' to make the connection. Arrived and left out of 2E which is clean and modern with easy signage. The flight connections centre has lots of screens detailing the departure gate of your next flight. With Sky Priority everything we were through security in 3 minutes and in the lounge at 2E within 20 mins of landing (you don't need to clear passport control as UK is outside Shengen anyway). Lounge at CDG nice although slight absence of food but we weren't hungry as had just been fed. Boarding onto Airbus A340 with Sky Priority was pain free. Welcomed on board by charming and good- humoured crew. Despite the age of these aircraft the cabin looked and felt new. The seats were very comfortable and nearly full flat - just off 180 degrees horizontal. I'm 6ft and had no issues getting a great 4 hours sleep. Food-wise we were welcomed with champagne and juice. Shortly after our on-time take off menus were brought round. The amuse-bouche followed (more champagne) cold salmon starter choice for 4 mains cheese desserts and digestifs. A buffet was set up at the rear of the cabin and crew were on hand if you needed anything. There was an Express option of meals if you wanted it. The only minor gripe I had was that there are only 2 toilets in business class cabin. In Bogota bags off in 10 minutes. Return trip much the same - Air France uses the LAN lounge which was excellent. Crew couldn't have been better and inflight services were all excellent. The IFE doesn't have the range of Emirates but had enough recent films/TV to keep me going. I prefer the personalised service at AF over robotic EK crew. While I can get by in basic French (which was appreciated by staff) my travel partner was English speaking and was treated equally well. I'd recommend AF business to anyone for a long haul trip and CDG was a dream to transit through (although may be a different story in economy).
2323,JFK to Belgrade via Paris. Outbound we traveled in business and returned in premium economy. Awful experience in both classes. It was worse on return in premium economy. The plane was old and dirty seats very uncomfortable. The food was awful. Stale breads lack of taste small portions. We were refused entry to the lounge on return in Paris even though the premium economy tickets state that we are permitted to use the business class lounge. I would not fly Air France again. And on the way out they lost our luggage all four pieces. There was absolutely no help with connecting flights in Paris. There was not one person that we ran across at the airport who was helpful.
2324,Lisbon - Paris - Havana + Havana - Paris - Lisbon. On the way to Havana everything went ok there was an entertainment system onboard with recent movies and tv shows though I would have appreciated a little more offer. The food was good for airline meal. The check in was efficient in Lisbon and in Paris but not so much on Havana. The flight back departed with an hour or so delayed because the crew of the flight arrived late making me lose my connecting flight to Lisbon with more than 4 hours difference from what was schedule. I was offered a voucher for a sandwich + drink. I won't fly again with Air France because even though nothing serious happened it could have because they showed at various levels lack of reliability. They offer good discounts sometimes and their economy class is very good; but if you like punctuality you should look for other airliners.
2325,MEL-LHR-MEL in June. Aircraft: Very impressed with the 787 (Dreamliner) - leg room and the seat pitch is very good and comfortable the cabin environment is nice. Food: curry was the only option and catered for Indian passengers. Very limited option (no alternatives). No child's meal provided requested at the time of booking and it was not available (so if you are travelling with children please take your own food). Refreshments only served with meals not provided in any other times considering the long flights on all the sector. Entertainment: Is mainly aimed at Indian audiences very limited entertainment and games for kids (suggest taking a tablet/DS loaded with your favourite movies or games to keep them occupied). The senior management need more focus to improve the standard and efficiency as Air India has joined star alliance they need to improve on following to be par with other major airlines and to attract more passengers with different nationalities. Cabin crew must improve their customer service. More variety of food option for all ages especially for children. Refreshments are served on regular basis on long flights. Noted that toilets are not cleaned during the long flight and some are unusable due to cleanliness. It appears that cabin crews not checking are more interested in resting in their pods for majority of the flights. Improvement on on-time performance as our both outbound and inbound flights are delayed. Surely would like to fly once again and hope the service will improve with joining with star alliance and management focus to turnaround the airline.
2326,My husband and I took Air India from Kolkata to Singapore. Our domestic flight was good but the international flight was horrible. We were given different seats no blankets were provided and the food was cold and very small in quantity. Even the inflight entertainment was zero as nothing was working in order. Whole journey we suffered a lot.
2327,"The Air France Experience was ""could do better"". Our morning flight from Birmingham to Tunis yesterday was an experience. We checked in on time with two suit cases for our short journey to Paris (CDG). Flight was enjoyable however the breakfast was poor croissant stale service slow. There were no signs at CDG telling us where our next connection was. All it needed was a screen at the exit to show the flights desks and connecting details. It left us wondering around between L & D2 and the Duty Free. Fortunately the plane took off late so we did not miss our connection. However the reason why it was late some passengers did not check in so bags were unloaded (including ours as we later found out to our cost) and on arriving in Tunis one of our bags was missing. After a long wait in the baggage hall we  with several other passengers who had the Air France experience reported the loss but as no one there could speak English we left hoping that our bag would be sent on to us. Twenty four hours later it was not. We are still waiting for someone from the line to explain and return our luggage. Air France is no better than Ryanair for it's service or passenger concern and the cabin crew need retraining in customer service."
2328,NRT to CDG. Staff courteous but not attentive nor particularly warm or friendly. Like the experiences of other reviewers here after the first meal had been cleared away the crew appeared once with water and once with ice-cream then disappeared before serving breakfast. Meals were poor but a selection of snacks (hot soup sandwiches cookies and drinks) were available in the galley. The entertainment system was a disappointment after flying this route several times over the last years with other airlines. The personal screen was small and hard to see and movie choices very limited especially for children. My biggest complaint was the standards of cleanliness. The plane was obviously quite old (with ashtrays still on the doors at the back) and looked a little worse for wear (toilets looked particularly grubby) but there is no excuse for the lack of cleaning. When I unclipped my try for the first meal there was a used tissue stuck in there and the tray was covered in crumbs. Someone had either been sick over or spilled their lunch over the (very bulky) airline magazine in the seat pocket of my daughter leaving it sticky and smelly. Somehow staff were unable to regulate the temperature in the plane and it was quite cold (other passengers wrapping themselves up in whatever they had with them)- aside from 45 minutes or so in the middle of the night when the heating system had obviously been turned on full-blast and the cabin turned into an oven. The blankets looked very tatty and dirty and when released from their meaningless plastic bag proved to be covered in thick long black hairs. I opened all the bags of our party of four and they were all equally as filthy so went unused. In terms of value we booked the flight 9 months in advance and got a decent price but I hope I never have to use AirFrance again.
2329,"I booked an Edinburgh to Perpignan flight with Air France and to my surprise I received no frequent flyer miles. Nothing in the documents I have printed indicate this and at GBP 376 it was not the cheapest option. Today I received an email saying they reward my loyalty and that ""it always earns you more miles."" Air France certainly needs to look at their service especially as with code sharing their clients have a chance to compare them with other carriers."
2330,"Overall the service on the flight was inline with other international carriers. The food was acceptable curry was the only option and I suggest that all passengers opt for the ""veg"" option. Entertainment is mainly aimed at Indian audiences and I expected and agree with this. I suggest taking a tablet loaded with your favourite movies or shows - but I would do this on any airline. The 787 is by far much more comfortable that the 777. Very impressed with the 787 (Dreamliner) - leg room is normal the seat pitch is incredible the cabin environment is lovely and the atmospheric conditions are noticeably better on the 787. (I didn't think this after the outbound journey which consisted of two 787 sectors. The return journey was a 777 sector followed by a 787 sector this is when you notice how great the 787 really is). Transit via Delhi: Information around this process is extremely hard to find on the internet with mixed reviews on sites such as this. If you are an international transiting passenger (i.e. you have landed in Delhi and are connecting with another Air India flight within 24 hours) then you do not need a visa so long as you are not exceeding 24 hours and are not leaving the terminal. There are two options inside the terminal for accommodation. I have done both. Eaton Smart Hotel - transit hotel - This is the option for a transit greater than 4 hours. If you stay here you can also leave the hotel and access any facilities in the terminal - just keep you passport and boarding card with you. Sams Pods - Ideal for less than 4 hours. $10US/ hour. You have access to a bed TV and desk in a small pod in the terminal building. No access to wash facilities other than those provided in the terminal. If you have a flight with Air India and have a long transit it would be well worth you questioning your ability to get a hotel paid for by the airline. I paid for mine as advised for by my flight centre agent. All other passengers on my flight managed to get this included in their ticket free of charge. If you pay for it you are looking at $190AUD."
2331,I travelled on Air India from London(LHR) to Chennai via Bombay. The first leg was a brand new 787 it is great product seating 3-3-3 and much better leg room then any other airline. I am tall 6.2 ft still I find very comfortable seating. On board we had 3 servings one drinks service with beer wine and spirits one good full meal with choice of Chicken fish or veg options and one snack before landing. For 8 an hours flight - lots of food. Good quality food and we enjoyed it and there were desserts too! Inflight entertainment was good with choice of new Hollywood and Bollywood movies TV shows sports and business section - enough to keep us busy for 8 hours. FA's were good lots of smiles and caring for kids and elders. Toilets were kept clean all the time. Flight landed in Bombay full 30 minutes ahead of schedule. The second leg was an A319 again good product hot breakfast served with choice of either Scrambled eggs and potato or South Indian Veg. We all enjoyed the breakfast. Air India has improved a lot and now stands on par with other international airlines. I will fly again and recommend fully.
2332,Flew on the brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner to Amritsar from Delhi. Fascinating experience. The plane met all my expectations with beautifully designed cabin and lighting. The meal was also served despite being a 45 minutes journey. Surely would like to fly one again.
2333,An hour late leaving Taipei. Plane seating was very tight but ok for me. Staff immaculate and very polite - probably this airlines saving grace. Food was hot but a bit bland. Couldn't hear hostess or pilot on the intercom. Return flight was ok smaller airbus but seating adequate. Again food was nice and hot but I had to ask for tea which should be served after meal. I didn't expect too much from an hour and a half flight but they could supply headphones and music. Also both flights were serviced by steps NO air-bridge - surely this wouldn't affect pricing too much would it? Overall fair for the price but some attention to detail needed.
2334,ICN-MFM on old A321. Seats are old styled and very tight. Service is outstanding but meals are poor. No various beverages for their serving as well. Captain spoke English very well. A321-200 is too narrow between seats and aisle however quite ok for me. For my next trip if the price is right then I may use this flight again.
2335,SIN-CDG for particular schedule and price won't do again unless they have a complete overhaul of facilities. Business class was just poor and mean the 2-3-2 seating is unacceptable - had preselected aisle seat but when went to checkin online had been put in a middle seat. There was one available aisle left row 12 with toilets behind. Everything was just tacky lots of plastic and plastic wrapping on amenities - having disposable covers for the headphones is unpleasant - but probably necessary since the headphones appear fixed in the seat. Entertainment offerings were basic food exceedingly average. amenities pack basic blanket made of that rather nasty artificial velour-type material that feels like it will give you an electric shock. Seats uncomfortable headrest juts forwards armrests solid so can't use as arm rests. They may be upgrading their business class but should be discounting what they offer - I travel frequently and I've had better food entertainment systems and amenities in other airline's premium economy. This experience was by far the least of any business class I've flown in the last 5 years. Staff were fine doing their job politely.
2336,Flew LHR-CDG-SIN Business class. After having read the reviews on here I wasn't really sure what to expect - and was pleasantly surprised. The seat was very comfortable most so in a reclining position. When converted to bed was less so but none the less satisfactory. The service was really good very friendly and professional having recently taken Singapore Airlines on the same route I had low expectations. Food was lovely - quality good presentation and flavoursome. The IFE was not the best; difficult to navigate around cumbersome - however had some interesting films. Overall I would recommend them for long hall business. Very pleasant journey and very reasonably priced.
2337,AF Premium Economy is an upgrade to an already good Economy product at least on the Airbus A380. Noteworthy - and better than on BA - is that on short-haul flights to Pairs with Air France PE passengers are seated in Business and receive business class service. Only the middle seat is not free as in Business. On my flight from CDG to SFO the crew were very friendly the food was good and the PE seats provide a lot of private space. I could sleep for a few hours but people who complain that the shell seats are too hard will be pleased to hear that AF also replaces the cushions in the A380 seats (and improve the touchscreen). You get an amenity kit sky priority boarding and check in plus a slightly better main meal. No pre-flight cocktails and certainly not the enhanced catering as on Air New Zealand. However if you need to work and/or want to watch a few movies in a comfortable environment and cannot afford business class then AF PE is definitely worth checking out.
2338,Flight cancelled by 24 hours because the plane was leaking (which they only found out when we have already boarded). Long awaited vacations had to be cut short by this whole day as even though we were in their head quarters in Paris they had no airplanes to replace this. We had to wait in a bed and breakfast next to the hotel for the whole day and night and Air France offered no compensation terrible customer handling no one properly explains anything their personnel are rude entertainment screen for my husband did not work on the flight the staff are surprised by upset customers. We flew the next day wish we had never flown with them just a ruined start to a long awaited vacation and no customer service considering that we paid over 2000 euros for the flights. Terrible airline no customer service airplanes broken in such a competitive market I have no idea how they still exist.
2339,Traveled from NY (JFK) to DEL (IGI) in May 2014. The ticket was slightly more expensive than other airlines but the flight was half empty. The plane was a Boeing 777-300ER with a very nice cabin and a 3-3-3 configuration (unlike 3-4-3 on most other airlines). I requested the air hostess to move me from the front row to some empty seats behind and she happily did so. I was in the center aisle and both seats besides me were empty I could sleep (laid on 3 seats) all the way through without any disturbance. The food was excellent staff was good and the in- flight entertainment was nice (not the best but you will like it esp. if you are an Indian). Flight was on time. I would certainly recommend Air India it esp for the JFK-DEL route.
2340,5th June flight AI 302 and returned on 16th June flight AI 301. Traveled to Sydney from Delhi and back on Dreamliner very convenient timings excellent staff service. Nothing better than a direct flight will travel again on Air India to international destinations.
2341,Flew BOM-GOI and back (AI 661 and 662). Outbound: A321- Check-in smooth flight was delayed by 30 mins due to airport congestion was kept informed by the cockpit crew with regular updates. Crew were attentive friendly and responsive - although only peanuts juice and water was served. Inbound: A321 - Check in smooth flight was delayed by 20 mins and received the revised time SMS well in time Flight took off as per revised schedule again crew was attentive friendly and responsive although same thing was served for snacks. Overall a good experience and would recommend.
2342,My wife and I recently flew MFM-CTU in business class. The flight departed Macau 40 mins late with no explanation offered to passengers. Once onboard A320 the polite though business like crew assisted passengers in storing carry on items. The aircraft interior could have used a thorough cleaning. Meal service was efficient although flight attendants disappeared once the bland food was served. The pilot and first officer spoke excellent English cabin attendants could have used some tutoring. We chose this carrier because it offered the only choice of non stop service between Macau and Chengdu.
2343,Flew Air Macau from Tapei to Macau and back during the Chinese New Year. A321 were deployed at the TPE-MFM sector. Economy class was full seats were cramped but bearable for the 1.5 hr flight. Food was poor. MFM-TPE sector had no boarding bridge so has to take the bus to the aircraft. Which I find it quite annoying given how small the Macau International Airport was and not much traffic go through Air Macau still can't find a boarding bridge. Again food was poor on the way back. Crew on both flight were efficient though but lack of smile and can clearly felt that they were treating Business Class passengers better when the curtain between the two classes is still open.
2344,If this is first class let me go back to business class. On an airbus A380 between JNB and CDG. No pre take off drink as no welcome drink. Service just average food nothing great. Do not know if 1st class product is up to it from AF was extremely disappointed and will not pay such a high price for such a bad service.
2345,Flew from Paris to Cayenne on April 2014 in business class. Overall good experience nice lounge in Paris Orly West fast track to go quickly from customs and police. Good seating on board with a 2x2x2 configuration angle lie flat NEV4 seat but very comfortable. Good food and excellent champagne. The crew were very attentive at every moment. I noticed Air France will change soon business class seat on international haul flights on a 1x2x1 configuration I hope it will soon include flights to the Caribbean.
2346,January 2014 - AF 347 Montreal - CDG and AF 342 from CDG to Montreal in business. Experienced the usual insult again by the AF staff. If you are not French you don't count at AF even if you do your best to address the staff in French. Big difference with the friendliness shown by the staff a sister company KLM. Seats are OK but I don't understand that when AF overhauled their business class some years ago they didn't go for flat beds (even not on the brand new A380). Food is OK although why is the bread always stale?
2347,I flew from Amritsar to London via Delhi on flight AI115. Early morning departure from Amritsar with 2 hour stop over in Delhi then it was 7am when we took off from Delhi. The flight to Delhi was 50 mins on an airbus A321. Was given juice and a snack. No complaints. On the international leg it was a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The flight was brilliant. I cant complain. The leg room was great (I flew economy). Even when the person in front reclines their seat it isn't uncomfortable. The IFE was excellent. Fast and easy to use. Plenty of movies to choose from mainly Bollywood with a few regional choices too. Maybe not so great on the Hollywood selection. The breakfast wasn't the greatest but for airline standards it was ok. Later in the flight lunch was served. It was lovely. I had the non veg option. It was chicken rice and also saag. It was probably one of the best airline meals I've had. The crew were well presented and hospitable. The flight was ahead of schedule too. Plane was spotless. I would definitely recommend Air India.
2348,Travelled by AI to HYD. Aircraft was VT-SCB in the Indian livery. Plus points: Check in was a breeze. Flight departed on time. Minus points: Aircraft was unclean. Crumbs on the tray table the side panels looked as if the last time they had been cleaned was during the Airbus delivery. All that pax were given was 2 cheap pieces of biscuit. The spring rod from the seat pocket was broken and was poking my knee on for the entire flight. For a full flight I did not have an option to change my seat. Never again with Air India.
2349,"AF0111 Shanghai-Paris 25 Jan 2014 - Business Class. Nice A380 despite cabin too warm. After all the promotion for this plane and then at the meal they run out of food. You are offered either Chinese or Vegetarian trays you walk away with a bad taste in your mouth. You truly think that after one week of Chinese food I want Vegetarian or Chinese? Which part of ""Business Class"" do they fail to understand."
2350,Flew LHR-CDG-GIG in business class. The seats were normal on both sectors but we were disappointed with the IFE system which was very cumbersome. The crew were very friendly. The food offerings on the long haul sector were often way too complicated. Equally the promised buffet available throughout was non existent which made for a very long and hungry flight. Would only use again if price were right.
2351,Houston to Tel Aviv. Flight from Houston to Paris very old 777. Small personal screens. Very hard seats. Food as on many AF flights has become lousy. After dinner all staff disappeared beside an ice cream service. Flight from Paris to Tel Aviv same as the past several years. Small A320. Hard seats no personal TV and bad food. With prices AF is charging there many options out there and better service.
2352,SIN-CDG return on a Boeing 777-300. Arriving at Paris there was a long wait before we could disembark then about 20 mins in bus to terminal building. Not the efficient service we are used to in Singapore! On return flight we experienced bad turbulence (worst we frequent fliers had ever experienced). At no point did the captain speak to the passengers to apologize explain or reassure and as it was night the FAs were nowhere to be seen. Furthermore 3 TVs for my family of 5 were not working and all the FAs did was repeatedly restart the system. We asked to change seats as plane was not full but had to organize with with other passengers to ensure our kids weren't sitting alone. I did not feel the FAs' English was good enough to deal with this problem competently. They did the minimum during the whole flight. Food was okay but I would've expected Air France to serve better.
2353,The service offered was very poor. There was no entertainment at all. I travelled from Hyderabad to Delhi. The duration of flight is two hours. Service was unavailable during the entire journey. The food was not at all good.
2354,It was a BHX-DEL-ATQ return flight on the Boeing 787-8. I had read the comments thinking it was horrible but it turned out to be the opposite! An ordinary Meat Curry with Saag Aloo and Rice! Entertainment was impressive- Bollywood and a few Hollywood movies! A steward didn't give my wife a vegetarian meal! She gave her a Chicken Meal nevertheless another steward came and gave her a veg meal so it was okay!
2355,Bangkok to Mumbai. We were travelling along with family. Horrible flight. Travelling period was 4 hours 30 min. Entertainment system was not working at all. Staff on the board was not cooperative. It was a horrible experience.
2356,Flew AF from CDG to Havana 3 weeks ago. Flew Economy but bagged the two seat row at the rear of the 777. That allowed us to walk about without disturbing fellow passengers. Good leg room. Comfortable seating. Food good with additional snacks en route. Plenty of wine soft drinks and beer. Great crew and adequate entertainment. Departed CDG a little late but made up time to land Havana more or less on time. Return journey not so good. aircraft booked solid. Had no choice of seat. Food not very good due to supposed catering issue in Havana and departed 3 hours late. That decided it for us next time upgrade to business even if we have to pay more.
2357,"DUB-CDG-ABV. I flew AF 3 times on this route in 2013 and have to say there's been a tremendous improvement with on board food in Economy compared to their competitors. Also the flight attendants were courteous and actually smiled which was great especially in comparison to the ""smile less"" Lufthansa flight attendants. The inflight entertainment selection was ok. However the coach transfers is a pain really but other than that AF is cool on this route and equally offers good fare prices to same. Its AF for now and the foreseeable future."
2358,Udaipur to New Delhi. The flight left 30 minutes early - I hope everyone was on board. The flight attendant's were vey good but we did not eat the meal. The other 6 business class passengers who were Indian asked what the meal was and would not eat it. Overall the flight was comfortable and we would fly Air India domestically again.
2359,Bom-Jaipur-Bom on A319. I was surprised to receive breakfast outbound and snack inbound. There was no choice and they only served tea/coffee/water as beverages but what they served was pretty good. The cabin attendants were pleasant legroom was good. There was seatback IFE but it appeared to only have one channel playing some Bollywood farce. Both flights were quite good for a short domestic hop.
2360,BCN-ORY one-way to catch a QR flight at CDG. Obviously a very bad flight once again due to a very bad crew. But still nothing you can compare with rude disorganized and idiot ground staff at ORY. Bus shuttle to CDG was to pay despite of integrated flight ticket. EUR 21 for 20 km. What a crockery. Delayed 20 minutes chaotic driving style driver was screaming me like a jail keeper as I complained about it. Never again.
2361,"ATH-CDG-LAX. ATH-CDG: Slept through this flight other than a quick breakfast which tasted alright no other comments on this flight. CDG-LAX: Airbus A380 (AF66). We flew near the rear of the aircraft which was quite empty to the surprise of my group as well as the flight attendants. After seeing this I went to move seats but was reprimanded by the flight attendants to sit down even though the seat belt sign had not yet been illuminated! After taking my seat it was clear the seats were much wider than those I had been on before measuring at about 19.0"" wide. The food that was served was fantastic starting with a nice tortellini with squash and ending with an ice cream sandwich. There was a second meal served at a later point which also tasted nice. Between meals I used the IFE which had a great selection but was unresponsive at times and seemed to take a long time to load. Some of my friends had issues in terms of functionality as well. Arrival was very uneventful with the lengthy lines in customs to deal with. Overall I really enjoy Air France and hope to fly them again."
2362,Paris CDG to Seoul ICN with a Boeing 777-300er. I was very disappointed by the poor quality of the seat. They were from the old generation with a very small individual screen. The seat was very hard with a lack of legroom. The meal was good but could have been improved. The crew were nice. Regarding the inflight entertainment - good choice of movies but very poor choice of music.
2363,Travelled 11th April 2014 was very disappointed with the delay we faced at LHR 6 hours delay due to technical problems with the new dreamliner 787. Not happy with leg space I was expecting something a bit more sophisticated not nice experience for those who are broad and tall. Had problems with entertainment system on the way to DEL and on the way back to LHR crew were friendly. Sorry Air India but first and last.
2364,BOM-DEL-SYD we reach domestic airport by 7 am to beat Mumbai traffic to catch our 10 am flight since we were FFM there is seperate queue at domestic airport and queue was small and quick The check in staff was not all courteous. We requested in case we can be pushed up on earlier flight to Delhi for which he asked us to pay extra for changes so we continue with our original booking. Flight boarding from Mumbai was slow and eventually took off 50 minutes late and hence reach Delhi at 12.45 for our connection flight to Sydney departing at 13.25. DEL staff were prompt to receive us and took us to transfer desk and immigration and finally get our security clear and put us on our flight at such a short transit time. due to delay we could not enjoy new Delhi airport. Flight from Delhi departed on time flight was light so staff made announcement for passenger to move and spread out in aircraft if they wish and occupy empty rows good meal courteous staff cabin was clean few toilets were smelly - wish they do something to keep them clean on long flight decent entertainment.
2365,Melbourne to Delhi. The new Dreamliner 788 is a great plane a lot quieter more room to move about cleaner air and large windows. Left and arrived early. Business class half empty so the service was very good not quite as good as the Asian airlines but more than satisfactory. Seat comfort was fine and the lay flat bed made sleeping easy. The entertainment was good watched 2 movies in English. Ordered special food which was my mistake and cannot blame the airline for the disappointing food. The snack between meals (smoked salmon) was most enjoyable. The extras included a nice travel suit better than Qantas pyjamas duvet and pillows were comfortable and travel socks and eye masks supplied. Second leg Delhi to London plane service and entertainment as good as the first flight. Food. Gave up on my special meals and ordered from the menu. Breakfast (Poached eggs) was fine and the dinner (Supreme of chicken) served just prior to arrival as good as any meal I have had on a plane. Fresh fruit to finish. Extras - none which for a 9 hour plus flight was surprising bnot even travel socks.
2366,Short haul flight from Trivandrum to Chennai. Pleasantly surprised by the condition of the aircraft which was a new one. The crew were efficient and friendly. The flight was on time and there were no time discrepancies on arrival either. Since it was a short haul flight snacks were offered. There is always room for improvement like the inflight entertainment. Overall I was pleased and would definitely consider flying Air India again.
2367,"HAV-CDG-OSL. A full 777-300 with much dreaded 3-4-3 seating. Was lucky and got a window-seat all the way in the back in a double-seat. Still not very comfortable. Seat-pitch is not 32"" as AF says. Seat is hard recline of the kind where seat slides forward as you use recline button. IFE very good and easy to use. As always: You see the (always polite) crew the first 1.5 hour of the flight and then again the very last hour. Be it day or night flight. For the first time with AF I saw the cabin-crew serving water from bottles between meals. Hot meal is fine the so called breakfast a joke for us who do not rely entirely on sugar. I have now learned how to go from terminal 2F/E to 2G with the ""on-tarmac shuttle-bus"" and it makes the connection very fast and easy. Recommend AF? Only if price is low. Prefer sister airline in the AirFrance/KLM group but they are usually slightly more expensive from Norway."
2368,ZRH-CDG Airbus A318. Very chaotic Boarding and unpleasant bus ride to the aircraft. Over 25 minutes delayed towards scheduled arrival on a 1 hour flight without any information or apologies whatsoever. Coffee with small bakery snack OK. flight attendants professional and friendly. Had an exit row without paying any additional fees - good seat (10F). Overall OK but prefer flying with airlines where you do not have to use buses to board.
2369,SFO to CDG return. I booked 2 business class tickets 6 months in advance for cost saving. The equipment was changed on the return flight and I was notified of seat changes which required a call. 1 month before the flight they cancelled the return flight and rebooked on a different day without notification although they had email text phone information. I discovered this accidentally 3 weeks before the flight and contacted Air France and spent 1.5 hours on the phone making new arrangements with a choice of my money back or a flight on a different day. The flight at this time had almost doubled so I stayed an additional day with additional costs. When I contacted Air France their complaint process is difficult and eventually unproductive. I fly only once a year international but was disappointed by this airline.
2370,I recently travelled Heathrow to Bogota changing at Charles de Gaulle. I have travelled long-haul a lot in the last few years to Australia and I would like to say I was extremely impressed by the quality of the flight attendants on Air France. They could not have been more courteous helpful and considerate. The meals were a pleasant surprise too better than I have experienced on other long haul flights.
2371,Mumbai - Jeddah and back. The flight to Jeddah was a hopping service from Mumbai to Hyderabad and onto Jeddah. Aircraft was an old 747-400 piloted by an all women cockpit crew. Aircraft though old was neatly maintained. Served with a light snack on the Mumbai-Hyderabad sector and a full meal on the Hyderabad-Jeddah sector. Cabin crew curt but efficient. Decent selection of in-flight entertainment though some of the touchscreens were not working. Return was a direct flight to Mumbai. Aircraft was a 777-300. Neatly maintained. Efficient cabin crew. There was a slight delay in take -off due to a temporary runway closure at Jeddah airport but the captain was prompt to keep the passengers informed of the status. Decent in-flight entertainment system and a good hot dinner served. Air India looks to be improving its quality of service by the day.
2372,Flew in March 2014 LHR-CCU-LHR via Delhi. Outbound flight was Dreamliner new flight and good food/drinks service was excellent. DEL-CCU was also good as well. On my way back faced little bit of hassle at CCU airport re baggage x-ray CCU-DEL service was good but were not satisfied with DEL-LHR leg no choice of drinks and also no wine video entertainment was not working properly arrived London Heathrow ahead of time though. Service should be improved on DEL-LHR sector.
2373,My mother left on AI 43 MAA-DEL connecting AI 101 DEL-JFK on May 2 2014. Flight was slightly delayed from Chennai. She is 82 years of age and had a broken vertebra 6 months back and after my trip to SYD/MEL last Oct-Nov I decided that the transit is pretty good at Delhi and my mother could go unaccompanied in Business Class. The flight arrived 45 mins ahead of schedule at JFK and being a passenger in a wheelchair she was absolutely thrilled with the care the AI staff bestowed on her. The only issue I faced was getting a wheelchair at Chennai airport as the AI counter was closed and I was not allowed inside - but security staff were kind enough to offer a seat for my mother and advised me to get an AI staff and fetch a wheelchair. My mother informs me that the connection in Delhi (to AI 101) was very smooth and she was well taken care of. She was full of praise for the cabin staff. AI has definitely turned over a new leaf and there has been a tremendous improvement in their attitude as well as service - their hub at T3 Delhi is much better than what prevailed in Mumbai and the ground staff are wonderful at Delhi!
2374,Flew DEL-MUM-DEL. Flight was on time and food was excellent. The IFE was satisfactory. They need to improve on that. Overall experience was good. Highly recommended.
2375,AMS to Rio and back from Buenos Aires both through CDG. Have had difficulties pre-selecting a seat or checking-in online. Just like the time before or the time before that. CDG-Rio leg on upper deck of 747 in AF seatplus (ordinarily payable but free for FB elite which is my case). Check-in agent in AMS wasn't able to put me on those seats. At CDG a very friendly and helpful agent did. Cabin half empty seats quite good for economy and service friendly and professional despite the late departure hour. BUE to CDG on 777. Seats cramped and seat configuration defies logic. Seats are so arranged that for window passengers there is nothing but the window itself to lean against and try to sleep. Easily one of the worst long haul economy propositions I've come across. Departure on time and early arrival. Food inedible.
2376,As a Delta Platinum member who flies mostly on Air France I was astonished when Air France took away my wife's seat and put her on a waiting list when traffic kept us from arriving at the airport in Paris until 90 minutes before the flight. This was despite our being on the same reservation - with an 8 year old child with us! I was told that a Flying Blue Elite Plus member would have been treated the same way which is even worse than thinking it was an aberration. This is the second time that Air France's computer system tried to separate my family. Luckily a very nice agent managed to get this fixed although we then had to run to the gate. Then in the flight the food was truly the worst we have ever eaten on an international flight. My son and I ate almost nothing during an 11 hour flight. The deterioration in Air France's food over the last two years is dramatic. On the positive side the crew was very nice and the new 380 aircraft was unusually quiet and had decent leg room for economy seats. The entertainment program was also good.
2377,"We used AF in premium economy for a HAM-CDG-HAV round trip in March and found the flights excellent value for money. The long hauls were on barely two years old 777-300s. We found the shell seats more than adequate for Y+ (though we are both tall) bearing in mind the very (!) reasonable fare compared to C. Flight attendants were impeccable - attentive all smiles efficient present at all times - and more than happy to converse in a variety of languages other than French (including German). Food and drinks were plenty well presented and of high quality. For those who like in-flight entertainment there was an abundance to choose from including lots of music and screens of decent size. As a nice add-on AF Y+ gives you some extra services (""sky priority"" i.e. quicker check in customer services and boarding and fast lane access at security / immigration) which are particularly useful at CDG. All in all very pleasant great value for money and definitely recommendable."
2378,BHX-CDG-PTY A318 out of Birmingham was good fun seats a little narrow but decent pitch crew pretty miserable juice and a croissant for an hour flight not bad. CDG is a pretty poor airport in comparison with other European hubs. Flight to PTY departed from terminal 2E. 777-200 was quite old but well maintained. 3x4x3 seating does make your seat very narrow but pitch wasn't too bad. Worst thing was the IFE like something from the late 90's choice was minimal and screen quality awful. Food and service was good (champagne cognac and ice cream all offered) but crew quickly vanished once the first meal was served although the self service trolley's are a great idea and encourages you to get up and stretch your legs.
2379,I flew BKK-TNR-BKK in business class in May 2015. Overall the 8 hr flight is good and on-time (a bit earlier than scheduled). On TNR-BKK the flight stopped in Bangkok before going to Guangzhou. A340 was used on this route. Staff are very nice the facilities on board like toilet entertainment and food and beverages could be compared to business class on other airlines. Inflight entertainment - no flying map no music no movie.
2380,I flew Economy Paris-Tana Tana-Antsiranana Antsiranana-Tana Tana-Paris in Sept and Oct 2014. Local flights were on 737 nothing special (neither bad nor good) the intercontinental flight was on an old 340. The fittings were old but ok seating and food ok as well in-flight entertainment a little inferior to Air France (smaller screen not as many choices) but then again AF also does not use their newest equipment on this route so that the difference is not this big. Two of the four flights were delayed by several hours one of which was my return flight on Oct 6 to Paris which was delayed by 3.5 hours. This may become a real problem for anybody requiring a connecting flight as AirMad has no code-share partners in Europe with whom one could book a combined ticket. Hence it cost me about 350 Euro to change the reservation for my AF connecting flight (fortunately it could be changed) and Air Madagascar is not willing to reimburse me referring to the conditions of sale (even though AirMad told me differently in Tana when it became clear that the delay would cause me to miss my connecting flight in Paris). Hence people not living near Paris or Marseille should take this risk into account (after all my so far longest delay on an AirMad flight was 13 hours in 2010 hence one should plan on long transfer times to be on the sure side). I would not recommend it.
2381,AI310 BOM-DEL. Packed flight just ahead of the Holi Holidays but great on boarding and inflight service. On time departure and on time arrival.
2382,AI330 30 April BOM-BKK A321 Seat: 30A (Window). Check-in gain smooth and efficient agents urgently need to be trained to smile. Boarding was good the buses were clean not smelly and new. I use Air India for great legroom (better than TG) on all of their flights so this was again good. Inflight entertainment average 1 Hollywood 1 Bollywood 1 Punjabi 1 Comedy 1 Music channel fair for a 4 hour overnight flight. I've flown this flight many times and as usual I ordered VLML (Vegetarian Lacto-Ovo meal) and like every time on this flight it has never been offered. (Standard meal for as long as I can remember on this flight is (Vegetarian: 3 grilled Paneer cubes 1 Veggie puff and 2 Kachori balls). (Non Vegetarian: 3 Grilled Chicken cubes 1 Chicken puff and 2 Kachori balls). The crew ranged in age I must again commend them for their teamwork and efforts they were very professional courteous and service minded. Baggage delivered on time even though parked on a remote bay. Overall a great flight - obviously will fly them again.
2383,AI331 25 April BKK-BOM A321 Seat:9F (Exit Window). Check-in was Smooth and efficient agents in BKK had smiles on their faces. Boarding was decent and organised. Seat with obviously great legroom (Exit window). Inflight entertainment crashed in the first 15 minutes of being airborne. I ordered a VOML (Vegetarian Oriental meal) less than 6 hrs prior to departure but my surprise it was offered to me on the plane. I must commend the Crew who make a huge effort to satisfy passengers on the plane since most of them are first time flyers and seeing Drinks/Food being free they want to extract the most they can. Loved the good sleep. Warning - Seat row * has a layout of 2x2 against the standard of 3x3 these seats do not recline at all (Staff at the check-in warn you of this as well which is great).
2384,AI 639 BOM-BLR and AI 610 BLR-BOM: Major plus points are 1) Better legroom 2) Hot meal and 3) Inflight entertainment (for what it is worth) - at approximately the same price as LCC's. Staff were efficient and some even smiled. Flight was late out of BOM informed by SMS 2 hrs in advance (which is not much help). Both flights were light so plenty of space quick service and not much crowd around the loo. Baggage appeared in decent time. So all in all not a bad option.
2385,"BOD-NCE operated by the new value cost subsidiary ""HOP!"" in a neat EMB170 with leather seats. Free newspaper a drink and a biscuit for this on time one hour flight. Cabin crew very nice and professional. We were greeted by the captain together with the purser. Nice convenient flight at a reasonable price."
2386,"Flew Paris to Oslo. The flight is operated by AF's subsidairy called HOP. They operate smaller planes although the Embraer 190 is decent enough. 2x2 seating with reasonable overhead lockers. Seat is adequate (much more leg room than an AF 777 in economy and probably a little wider) for a 2.5 hours flight. In both cases the crew did the job professionally although the service in economy is limited to a drink and some biscuits. On return was upgraded to ""Premium"" which is not much different (same seat) but includes a decent cold light meal and Champagne. Left on time and arrived on time both ways. it seems however that heating / A/C is diffcult to manage on all Embraer 19X planes every time I take one it is much too hot in the middle despite crew efforts. Globally a very decent performance. No IFE but the only competition (SAS) is not better and you have to buy your drink and the stewardesses on HOP were much more stylish."
2387,"ABZ-CDG-BKK (Round-Trip): ABZ-CDG Travelled 12th February early morning flight. Departed 15 mins late. No breakfast served. Just coffee or tea for a 2 hours flight. Quite pathetic honestly! 5 hrs layover at CDG since I am a flying blue petroleum - I would be able to use Business (Crown) lounge in Schiphol but not in CDG. Again pathetic! I believe since they are now like one company - they should offer the same standard service. Instead I was offered a 30 euros voucher for meal. CDG-BKK mostly full as it was a high-season over the far east. Lunch was served. Not much to praise about really. Small portion. Limitation of beer. I could not believe this! Nothing was served for the next 10 hrs beside cheap-looking sandwich and help-yourself drinks. The newly design thin-cushion seat is just terrible. Could not imagine how bigger person could tolerate that long! ""Breakfast"" was served an hour before landing - I would not call it breakfast myself. Return leg pretty much the same. Cheap sour wine. I asked for one more bread roll could not believe that it was turned down. Return flight from CDG-ABZ was a bit more cheerful with sandwich and drink offered for an evening flight. It was my first time with AF and probably the last."
2388,My flight was AF188 from Paris Charles de Gaulle to Hong Kong on the 10th march 2014. The plane took off and landed on time the service was good flight attendants were polite and professional. I travel a lot and the food on economy was much better than others airlines. I will definitely fly again with Air France and I recommend it.
2389,Flew from Toliara to Tana. What to say about Air Madagascar - the airline usually runs on Malagasy time and this was no exception. Flight was due to leave at 18.25. By 19.00 no plane had turned up and there was absolutely nobody in the terminal with any kind of information. There are screens in the terminal but as there is only 1 flight per day they are of little use. Fortunately TLE has a fairly modern terminal (for Madagascar) and a number of places to buy drinks. 8pm came and went then 9pm still no plane and it's getting dark. Eventually at about half past 9 three guys arrived in a jeep proceeded to drive down the runway setting up a series of cones with lights on top. The first we knew anything was happening was when a plane appeared on the runway taxied up to the terminal and unloaded some passengers. We were then allowed out onto the tarmac and up the steps to the plane. Plane was a fairly modern 737 seats were reasonably comfortable staff were very friendly and as the plane was only half full the flight was one of the most pleasant I have had on AirMad. Flying with AirMad is always an experience.
2390,We have just returned from Johannesburg via Antananarivo to Nosy Be on air Madagascar. All of our flights were on time. We found the airline to be extremely reliable the planes in good condition the staff extremely efficient and friendly. We shall certainly recommend Air Madagascar to all of our friends travelling to Madagascar.
2391,We flew from Bhopal to Delhi. Our international flight had a baggage limit of 25 kg however the limit on this flight was 15 kg. We were therefore way over the limit. We were taken away to a small room and made to feel like criminals. We had to pay a significant fine and were ignored when we tried to explain our situation. The whole situation was handled very unprofessionally and as a result we will certainly not use Air India in the future.
2392,Paris CDG to Kathmandu via Delhi and back. All flights on schedule. Comfortable planes (Dreamliner). Inflight entertainment good. Very good service at Delhi airport: my husband had left his coat on the plane a single inquiry and the coat was delivered to us.
2393,Flew from Bahrain-New Delhi. Excellent flight service has improved drastically since when I last flew. Clean new aircraft with comfortable seats. Cabin crew were polite and enthusiastic. Good selection of beverages and food (Indian options only) was delicious. Departed and landed on time. Entertainment was limited to Hindi films and a few old Hollywood classics. Air India could try improving its entertainment system. Other then that a perfect flight. Would not hesitate to fly AI again.
2394,My flight AF 55 from Washington to Paris on March 24 was cancelled on March 23 without explanation. The proposed replacement flight AF 4033 was also cancelled. I am left without knowing what to do with my hotel extension as I write this review on March 24 at 12.53 pm. My hotel check out is 13.30 and I have no news from Air France. I have decided to book another flight not knowing how much refund I will get. This is a very bad treatment of customers. On a previous same flight couple years back I was asked to take Economy with a Business Class ticket because the flight was overbooked.
2395,Flying from Paris to Singapore multiple times a year. Price of the ticket is marginally below Singapore Airlines but service and seat are much worse. Food is average - similar to Delta or US Airways and staff do the minimum that is required. It is hard to get a drink in between services ask for information or anything else than simply telling which drink we want and which main dish we want. Airline is surprisingly weak.
2396,Flew Heathrow to Washington via Paris CDG. Flight from London to Paris departed early and the croissant and drinks service was perfectly acceptable for this short flight. Crew attentive but the aircraft did have old style thick seats rather then the thin seats found on Lufthansa etc. Flight from Paris to Washington on 777-300ER departed late seat pitch was tight fine for me but could be uncomfortable for a taller person. Seat back TV on demand but screen was very small and choices not extensive. Meal was edible but contained no vegetables. Overall very average and there are far better ways to cross the Atlantic good job their economy is being refurbished later this year.
2397,CDG-RUH-CDG 7 hours flight from Paris to Riyadh. Departure and landing was on time however a minor incident happened in Riyadh where the plane was kept on the taxiway for about 20 mins because it had nowhere to park. Crew friendly and helpful. Very clean cabin with good food - CDG-RUH breakfast and RUH-CDG dinner. Alcoholic beverages weren't served when we where in Saudi airspace but once we left it I enjoyed a nice glass of champagne. Good experience highly recommended.
2398,CDG-TNR-CDG B767 TNR-NOS B737 NOS-TNR-TMM ATR 72 TMM-TNR Twin Otter. The seating on the B767 is uncomfortable. Entertainment poor and toilets not very clean. Positive points the FAs and food. A big positive point to the schedule - by leaving CDG at the end of the day you don't waste the next one not withstanding the 10hours flight. Domestic flights were nice and acceptable. However on the leg NOS-TNR I experienced a 5 hours delay (quite usual).
2399,We used Air Madagascar for four internal flights. All four were reasonably on time (max delay about 45 mins). Cabin staff friendly and good complimentary snack and newspaper on each flight. Be prepared for very rapid braking at fort Dauphin (short runway)
2400,SYD-DEL-BOM via MEL flew on 18th April. Flight was full so no chances for change of seats my entertainment system broke down so no entertainment available for whole flight it was a new 787. Lots of other passengers were complaining that their systems were not working. Otherwise flight staff were efficient quick and the food was good. Flight landed one hour late may be due to head wind but otherwise it was an OK flight.
2401,LHR-DEL-SYD. In both cases the plane was very lightly loaded in both business and economy cabins. Seats in B777 (LHR-DEL) and B787 (DEL-SYD) were lie flat and not too difficult to manoeuvre after a little experimentation. IFE: B777 has less choice for western tastes and the remote control was very fiddly in the end I gave up. B787 had touch screen which was much easier to use and more responsive. Service overall was very good except for one older female attendant on LHR-DEL who appeared to speak barely any English and could learn to crack a smile from time to time.
2402,AI 102 from JFK to DEL on their non stop service. I would rate the trip to be completely satisfactory. Comfort - This is what the trip is about. Kudos to AI team for having their Boeing 777-300ER to be configured as 3-3-3 seating instead of 3-4-3 seating which many airlines do this translates to excellent seat space and good leg room. The trip has perfect timings and usually reaches Delhi well ahead of schedule. Food - Being from Indian origin I liked the food which is hot and a little spicy. Entertainment - Now many would want a great entertainment units for this flight and even would have made plans to watch a lot of things inflight well don't this flight is great to sleep and rest. The movie selection was not great and their interface needs improvement Crew - Now there are a lot of small things that make an airline great and I do tend to see them from the captain speaking about the journey and enthusiasm of the crew with a big smile each time they serve. Transfer at Delhi was fast and breezy. Overall even though there are a few shortcomings I would recommend this flight.
2403,LHR to Jo'burg and back via Paris in Jan 2014. Full flight CDG to Jo'burg but very good service food films. Return less busy and had 3 seats to myself which was great overnight on a long flight.. Connections each way at CDG very smooth and in same terminal which helped. Last flew with Air France on business from Sanaa to Paris quite a long time back and although in 1st class was not impressed. Much improved airline on the basis of these last 4 flights.
2404,We recently flew from Detroit to Paris on Air France. Seats were crammed into spaces and not lined up evenly! Absolutely no room to move and when the person in front of us reclined they were in our laps! To get out of our seats we had to climb over arm rests because there was absolutely no leg room. I am a small person so you can imagine how uncomfortable this had to be for a larger person. I will never fly this airline again! No room to breathe horrible food miserable trip!
2405,GIG (Rio de Janeiro)-CDG-BCN. A poor flight from the beginning to the end. My luggage was 4kgs overweight at check-in. In order to avoid charges AF agent proposed me to purchase a hand cabin luggage at the airport and carry it with me in cabin. So did I. Luggage went through general security check however at the boarding gate I was asked to check it in without explanation. Equipment was a grotty A330-200 very reduced pitch IFE was not working cabin crew were incredibly rude and Chef de Cabine was behaving like a jail keeper. Food was inedible with very small portions toilets were dirty and smelly with no soap available. Arrival at CDG: dirty airport rude police agents absent ground staff. CDG-BCN was delayed without explanation and to end the bad dream second piece of luggage (hand cabin bag) did not fly to BCN and was kept at GIG. Needless to say never again with Air France KLM nor any SkyTeam member (by far the worst alliance all around the world).
2406,AI 55 Kochi to BOM. Fully packed late night flight on time decent dinner and decently well looked after for a short flight. Polite crew. Will fly again.
2407,Rating : 10/10 Cabin Flown Economy Value for Money Seat Comfort Staff Service Catering Entertainment Recommended
2408,JFK to CCU and back in Air India and I was in for a pleasant surprise. The aircraft a Boeing 777-300ER was clean the seat was reasonably comfortable. The food was good they offered Indian veg and non-veg and one continental platter. The crew would only offer you veg or non-veg one has to poke the crew and only then they would tell you of the continental option. The JFK-DEL flight arrived almost 70 minutes ahead of schedule. Once we deplaned there were Air India ground staff to help us connect to the onward domestic flights. The domestic flight was an Airbus A320. The flight was clean although surprisingly I found the crew more helpful and courteous than the international leg. It was on time as well and we landed at CCU a full 7 minutes before time. No surprises during the return flights as well. Luggage was delivered quickly on all occasions. The airline have certainly improved since the last time I traveled with them. However there are rooms for improvement in staff behavior and in-flight entertainment.
2409,Paris (CDG) to Mumbai (BOM) - The flight took off on time from CDG. It was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. The food served onboard was good plenty of drinks extremely hospitable and wonderful flight hostesses. In-flight entertainment was excellent. Reached Delhi half an hour before the scheduled arrival. Had a changeover at IGI T3 New Delhi. The flight from Delhi to Mumbai was an average one with good food good crew but a little bit noisy people around. I would definitely repeat Air India in the future.
2410,Paid for exit row seats on flight from Paris to Toronto reserved 4 months in advance as I am 6ft 5 in tall and need extra leg room. They oversold exit row seats and provided only one of the two exit row seats purchased (me and spouse) then like pulling teeth to get them to look at it and they refused to compensate the $70 for the exit row seat on the basis that we got a seat even if it was not exit row and even though we were seated in separate rows. Unbelievable customer service especially when all along they agreed on all the facts above.
2411,I travelled in Premium Economy from Toronto to New Delhi on February 24 2014 and returned on March 8 2014. Seats were very uncomfortable - no recline. Food was the same as in Economy Class. You have to travel back to the aircraft for toilet with the Economy Class passengers. No airport lounge access. Had to pay $55 at the Paris airport for lounge access. Lounge was good.
2412,Flight AF165 BKK-CDG on March 9. B777-300 plane was full big disappointment is the service during the flight better said no service. After take off lunch served food ok for economy cheap sour wine came with the food. After that for about 9 hours no service from PNC they kept snacks and drinks in the rear and front galley but how can passengers get out from the middle seat. 1 hour prior to landing there was a small food service again.
2413,AI 115 Amritsar to London Heathrow via Delhi the flight left Amritsar on time snacks served during flight and there was IFE available. The flight leaving Delhi was on time and we flew in a dreamliner. The flight actually landed an hour early and it was hassle free. The crew were attentive and the whilst there was IFE it could do giving you a wider choice of viewing you get the same selection on both inbound and outbound flights.
2414,AI 112 Heathrow to Amritsar via Delhi flight was on time leaving London staff were attentive only down side was the IFE need a wider choice of programmes and films. Aircraft was clean and the crew did make you feel welcome. Captain did keep us informed when we hit some severe turbulence as to how long it would last. I had heard some horror stories about flying with Air India but my experience was a good one. The connecting flight from Delhi to Amritsar also left on time you going get served snacks given it is only a 40 min flight.
2415,Flew BKK-BOM-LHR. BKK-BOM unexciting and somewhat hard-nosed female cabin crew which is a shame. Flight was on- time. 7-hour layover in Mumbai was lovely in new terminal building great food options and plenty of lounger chairs to lay-back and rest. BOM-LHR on 787 was fabulous very comfortable lots of legroom pleasant peaceful cabin except for one unfortunate air-rage incident which was handled very professionally by the cabin crew. Food a bit heavy for my liking but I would fly these guys again.
2416,I have flown Air France on my return trip from GRU-CDG-TXL. The check-in GRU was very chaotic but the positive aspect was that I was upgraded to Premium Economy which is better on an almost 12 hour flight. The AVOD on the B777-300 was quite outdated but the service was amazing and extremely nice. Everyone spoke Portuguese which was great for me. The food was very good. The seat comfort was worse than on KLM. The transfer in CDG was a breeze even though I had a 40 minute connection. The flight to TXL was uneventful and had the service was just professional. I would recommend to fly on Air France.
2417,"BKK-CDG 6 March 2014 on a 777-300. After having years of good experiences flying on Air France this was a huge disappointment. The seat pitch is ridiculously tight 22"" at best. I'm 194 cm tall. It was excruciating for a 12 hour flight. When the person in front me reclined immediately upon boarding my knees were crushed. The catering service was also completely inadequate. The first meal was served within 45 minutes after departure no drinks service beforehand. Instead a tiny bottle of cheap red wine came included on the meal tray. (It appears that the days of receiving Champagne even in economy are long gone.) The food itself was okay but there wasn't much of it. There was no food or drinks service for another 9 hours until a small meal was served just before landing by which time I was extremely hungry. This was a daytime flight which made the lack of service especially hard to fathom. There are drinks and snacks in the galley during the flight but I could not get out of my seat as I was boxed in the window seat by two people who did not did leave their seats for the entire flight and there was no room to get out. Their 777-300 aircraft has a 3-4-3 layout so the odds of finding yourself boxed into one of these tiny seats are quite high. Given the premium that AF charges on this route I will be much more likely to fly one of their Asian or Middle Eastern competitors in the future if this is how cut-rate their service is going to be moving forward. When disembarking from the flight I noticed that their premium economy and business class sections also appeared to be very cramped on this aircraft. I'm very disappointed with Air France and I am probably unlikely to go out of my way to maintain Flying Blue Elite status in the future."
2418,TXL-CDG-LAX. Both flights on time CDG-LAX on A380 special meal request honored good IFE clean cabin that was maintained during the flight most staff courteous and helpful. Wheelchair assistance requested for both CDG and LAX upon arrival in CDG none was available so my accompanying passenger had to walk the long distance between CDG Terminals 2F and 2L by herself. Somewhat compensated by security staff letting us use the Priority line for passport control and boarding. CDG-LAX: Usually after the meal service the majority of the cabin staff would go to their rest area and the cabin would be darkened. Well not on Air France. Before disappearing the cabin crew left a few trolleys loaded with snacks and drinks in the aft galley so that area turned into the most popular spot on the plane. My seat was in row 45 immoderately after the galley bulkhead so I was pulled into the bar action. At one time I counted about 25 people crammed into the galley area. There were several groups of 3-4 people each who just hung out for what seemed hours kept drinking alcohol and were becoming louder and louder. As all the lights in the galley were left on and as the curtain was open all the time due to the high passenger traffic the entire aft cabin was brightly illuminated and rendered the otherwise great concept of mood lighting completely useless. The economy class purser arrived shortly thereafter and listened to my complaint and then explained that it was airline policy not to provide beverages and snack runs between the meals as most airlines do but to keep the galley fully opened to the passengers for self-service. The party went on for the next 5 hours until the FA's were back and the second meal/beverage service was started. All in all this was a very unpleasant experience showing the complete lack of effort from the FAs and the pursers to rectify a situation in which a passenger was being inconvenienced. My recommendation: if you want to sleep on the AF 380 stay clear of the aft main deck cabin (rows 45 and up).
2419,I travelled on Air India flight AI301 serviced by the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. It was an excellent flight. The cabin crew were very friendly and smiled. The food was good but there was not enough western entertainment compared to other airlines. The seat was very comfortable with a great amount of leg room. I would love to fly with Air India again.
2420,The seats on 777-300 for AI 112 and AI 111 are a bit small. The reclining part of the seat is also not very much. Food is served quickly after the drinks are served. I was told that it is AI policy not to allow passengers to mix drinks. There was no wine on AI 111 and I think only red wine on AI 112. When I requested a second drink (AI112) I was asked why did I not ask for a larger drink first time. The food and staff were ok. Good value for the price in comparison to other airlines.
2421,Paris (CDG) to Detroit (DTW). Usually fly with Delta but had to book with Air France as the timing of the flight was more convenient. Seated at the back of the plane which smelt of urine at least for the first few hours of the trip. Seats are probably around 30 years old and completely worn out. It's impossible to raise the arms between the seats and the TV screen embedded in the seat in front of you is about 3x3 inches in size and blurry and impossible to watch. Staff friendly and helpful.
2422,Flew SCL-CDG-Rome and then back from London. Great experience as usual with them. We only have 2 companies flying directly to Europe one is Iberia (awful) and the other Air France. I choose Air France every time I can despite their prices have been rising over the past 2 years. Food was nice you can even buy a special menu if you want I ordered non diabetic food and it was even tasty! They also provided ice cream beverages and yoghurt during flight. Plus they were very helpful at CDG indicating ways to connect to our next flight. Entertainment was nice too a lot of good options. I tried to buy a ticket for a place with extra room leg for my father but it wasn't available. The only downside I had was that the flight at Heathrow was delayed about one hour so we had to rush (literally run) our way in CDG to not miss the flight home. Love the fact they provide a direct flight from Santiago to Paris.
2423,CDG-JNB-CDG. A380s Y class is probably the showcase of AF in this class. AF tries hard to make it a sophisticated experience: excellent IFE with lots of films good headphones for Y sleeping mask nice lights and music small bar with drinks and ice creams??But I was most of all impressed by the crews on both flights: very experienced extremely attentive very polite but with a sense of humour. These FAs like to interact with passengers and do care about their job as opposed to the robotic FAs of some airlines! One the downside meals were very disappointing and limited not sophisticated at all they used to be much better. Seats were OK but legroom was bad not a good experience if you're tall plus AF makes you pay for exit seats.
2424,AI331 6 Feb BKK-BOM A321 Seat 29F (Window). Excellent check-in service by BFS staff warm welcoming polite and very helpful. Good Legroom much better than other airlines narrow body for sure (even after the guy in front of me reclined the seat did not touch my knees - I'm 6ft 1). Excellent set of crew on the flight (all female operated flight) pre-booked for VOML (Vegetarian Oriental) was served promptly - after I ate I greedily asked for more food and was again promptly given a regular Vegetarian meal with a warm smile and was told to just call if i needed anything else. Could not fault this flight at all.
2425,AI330 20 Feb BKK-BOM A321 Seat 27C and my wife 27A (middle seat empty). Average service from the Indian staff at Bombay Airport no eye contact no greetings just come and go types. Crew again all female crew including cockpit welcoming and pleasant - but midway through the flight after the meal service things changed. I moved to the last empty row so my wife and I both could get some sleep however one of the crew members walked up to me and told me I could not sit there. This left a sour taste after the wonderful flight I had on the inbound.
2426,My family of 4 2 adults and 2 children traveled Dubai-Goa-Dubai on 20th Feb to 8 March on Air India direct. On 20th Feb Dubai-Goa the flight was scheduled at 11pm but took off at 12.20am. The delay announcement was very brief and no one was available at the gate for comments. If passengers were told even at 7-8pm in the evening it would have avoided rushing to the airport. Food specially for children could be managed by us etc. We were left standing as there was nowhere available to sit. No entertainment onboard the seat in the front had a torn pocket which had a wire coming out which could be very dangerous for my child. I had ordered a children's meal however on the flight back on 8th March none was given. When we pay a similar fare compared to other flights why can we not get the same services?
2427,CDG-DEL-CDG. I flew on a dreamliner it was my first time with this airplane. Surprisingly the business class is simultaneously comfortable and neutral. There is no soul in it not an ounce of charm that you frequently find with other companies. However it is very comfortable to sleep on a flat seat.
2428,Flew AF A380 from Heathrow to Jo'burg. Food was awful in-flight entertainment console was impossible to use as touch screen was so broken. Seats felt very cramped. Staff were friendly enough but didn't make up for shortcomings.
2429,CDG to Riyadh in Y class on the A330-200. This was one of the worst travel experiences I have had in recent years. I booked with Saudi who codeshare on this day of the week and went to check in at the Saudi desks in 2C. This was a mistake but Air France counter staff nearby were rude and unhelpful. Their customer service skills were so poor. Air France insists you use the automatic check in when travelling in this cabin but after queuing and following on screen instructions the machine then prints a notice telling you to go to the desk for traditional check in. Boarding was ridiculously slow and badly handled. Scanners failed to read every other card and just two agents on duty had to input details manually. The flight was scheduled for 1330 and was full but boarding did not begin until after 1300. The Y class seating configuration is grotesquely cramped. Seats are narrow with very little space. Should the passenger in front recline their seat the minuscule television screen will be almost touching your nose. Riyadh is not an especially lengthy sector but six hours in these tiny and packed rows was five hours too long. The seats cause real discomfort. The meal was only just hot and not pleasant and the red wine offered was very poor quality. Cheap plonk. Crews had barely enough space to move the trolley. Air France makes much of the glass of champagne it offers to all passengers but every other aspect of the service was very unpleasant indeed. Not to be repeated.
2430,AF112 CDG-PVG Feb 22nd 2014. Positive points of Air France Premium Economy: Seat is very spacious provides enough space for the arms and you can comfortably stretch your legs. Food is nice with starter and dessert. Negative points: The seat's padding: it feels like not existing and it is like sitting on a hard chair. By sitting on the provided blanket it is bearable for a long haul flight. The reclined position: The headrest does not move and forces your head in a strange bend forward position - sleeping is not really possible.
2431,The FRA-DEL leg was delayed 24 hours due to the heavy fog in Delhi (not Air India's fault) but they quickly and painlessly transferred us to a Airport Hotel where we had to spend the night. Air India even arranged for Indian food at the Hotel. Flight took off on time the next day at around 4pm and the Dreamliner was as usual excellent. Great leg room good food (though the portions were tiny the Steward quickly fixed that on request by providing me with an extra tray) staff attentive throughout. What surprised me was the attentiveness of the Stewards towards parents with young kids. Came to check up on the parents multiple times and kept the kids happy with candy and cola. The DEL-HYD leg was pleasant and on time. The return journey HYD-DEL-FRA was uneventful and on time. As a regular traveler on this route I can only recommend Air India for their great service. Contrary to what people say about the airline it has transformed from a hopelessly terrible service to a rather decent airline.
2432,Its been 20 years since I flew Air India and absolutely nothing has changed - the airline is still awful. I took a short hop DEL-JAI and a 40 minute flight turned into a 3 hour ordeal. Arrived DEL airport and check in staff said flight was on time. Went to gate and no plane or agent to ask questions. Told by uninterested ground staff flight was changed to different gate. Went to new gate and waited for 90 minutes and finally asked what time boarding would begin. Told flight was delayed by 1 hour due to late arrival of incoming aircraft - no announcements no information nothing. Ground crew stood around chatting on their cell phones as passengers got annoyed and angry. Finally boarded 90 minutes late and hustled into seats. After 30 captain says airport at JAI Is closed waited another 60 minutes then abruptly push back fro gate. Flight to JAI uneventful crew had a few smiles.
2433,CDG-LAX on A380. Staff were extremely nice both ways and had no problems whatsoever with flight very nice food as well.
2434,"We paid a premium price for 4 premium economy seats on two Air France flights on 26 Dec 2014. The Air France fights were from Dublin to Paris then Paris to Rome. The 4 seats AF provided us were not what AF claims to offer for premium economy in its promotional material. The premium economy seating ""fixed shell"" AF claims to offer didn't exist on these aircraft's. The seats we were given were the same or worse than a standard economy seats. Flight AF1279 from Dublin to Paris was tighter than a standard economy seat. It was one of the most uncomfortable flying experiences I have had in more than 50 years of flying. Flight AF 1404 Paris to Rome was a larger jet but still had the standard six economy seats per row. We booked 4 premium economy seats. AF claims there is ""40% more room"". AF claims there is a ""fixed shell"" in premium economy. The claims about for premium economy are untrue. We feel let down. The connection AF organised in Paris was so tight we had to run with two 7 year old children to get our second flight. Our day with Air France was horrible. Pick another airline."
2435,CDG-SIN-CDG. I was surprised at how bad the catering is out of Paris. I had gluten free meals that were really really poor quality. The salad was frozen hard and breakfast was a rather disturbing concoction. However out of Singapore the food was really quite tasty and certainly some of the better economy meals I've had. There were lots of snacks and drinks available by self-service. Leg room is good although the seats are very hard (tip: pack some sweaters to sit on top of). IFE is dreadful but the cabin crew were mostly friendly.
2436,AI 301 3 Feb 2014. Flew MEL-DEL. Chose Air India as it has a direct connection Delhi-Chandigarh. A friend was raving about the new Dreamliner. End up disappointed. Nothing special other than the fancy lighting on its windows and interior. The remote did not work thank goodness for touch screen TV. Food choice was either veg or non veg only both Indian cuisine. Portion was small ended up asking for a snack 3 hours after lunch was served. Cabin was messy by end of flight too many children on board unfortunately. Good points: Cabin staff were attentive to requests. The female crew uniforms are an old style definitely need a modern design. Also ground support staff were very good to ensure elders all received wheelchair support.
2437,Out LHR to DEL on Boeing 777. Return COK to DEL (A321) and LHR (Boeing 777). All sectors on time with DEL to LHR arriving 30 mins early. Air India staff looked after us well. On return met at domestic terminal by ground staff and escorted to international terminal. Many aspects of the service were good but not consistently good to rival better carriers. Choice of English films/music very poor with virtually no new films or music available. Meals (we are vegetarian) variable but unimaginative and not at a standard acceptable in business class. Staff generally attentive and good but not on domestic sector. Both journeys from and to LHR only half full in business. Whilst the overall product is not the best it is still good value and the low cost.
2438,Flew to Cape Town from Manchester via Paris. All flights were good as regards take offs landings etc. The Manchester to Paris and return flights were comfortable with enough room and an attentive cabin crew. The long haul flights were cramped and uncomfortable. The cabin crews were offhand and the food awful (from a French company). Some of the choices were non-existent and whole rows of passengers missed when drinks were offered. The announcements were too quiet to hear and said at such a speed that even if audible it would have been impossible to understand them.
2439,AF1068 CDG to Manchester on Sunday 16 February after flying in from Colombo. Airport was chaotic but check in was aided by very helpful AF staff who kept a pleasant and efficient attitude despite the numbers of passengers and a broken baggage conveyor. Travelled premium economy on a nearly full flight. Took off on time and service of meals commenced immediately. However we were in last row of premium economy so by the time we received the meal the plane was staring to descend into Manchester. The meal was OK though. Seat comfort was OK.
2440,Flew from Manchester to CDG on the day that the air traffic control in France went on strike. Flight arrived in Manchester on time and aircraft boarded on time but take off was delayed by 30 minutes due to strike. Pilot kept is informed of delay. Plane was full as previous flight cancelled due to strike. In flight service was good if a little hurried due to short flight time. Seat comfort was OK provided seat in front was not reclined. Obviously no IFE provided.
2441,Traveled from Frankfurt and Delhi and back. New large aircraft very comfortable. Good food good service. Left on time. Efficient ground staff and cabin crew. Highly recommended.
2442,AI 672 from Chennai (MAA) to Mumbai (BOM) by VT-SCT (A319). The only flight I had until now which departed 15 mins before the scheduled departure time from Chennai and arrived 30 mins before the scheduled time in Mumbai. South Indian snacks were given as a veg-option and the IFE was working. Though the movie started halfway when we boarded the aircraft. Cabin crew were very acknowledging.
2443,"Business class (AI 302) returning to Australia. I had read the poor reviews but the schedule was good it was non-stop the price was OK and I wanted to try out the new B787 Dreamliner. We were very pleasantly surprised. First the plane: it lives up to the hype. It was quiet and I can believe the pressurisation and humidity are closer to life on the ground. We slept well and felt good on arrival. The lie-flat seats were fabulous with cleverly designed spots to store your things. It was on time. Cabin service was fine if not notable. Ditto entertainment. One quibble: they served a large curry ""supper"" just before landing in Sydney early in the morning. Everyone else serves breakfast."
2444,I have used Air India for my 2 trips in 6 months for Sydney-Delhi flight. Even though planes are new and spacious with good legroom unfortunately 6 month old planes are falling apart too quickly components are broken in toilets inflight entertainment remote broken water seeping out of toilets on carpets service light not working or erratic tray tables dirty with no effort to collect rubbish during or at end of flight. Entertainment: Not much to watch / listen. Food: Nothing exciting again. If you are lucky to take off on time you will get a quick round of drinks. Staff will whack the meal on your tray table. As soon as meals are served you will see cabin crew coming at 100 miles/hr with tea / coffee pots. Next cabin crew are back with trolleys to collect your trays even though half of the plane is still finishing their meals. Staff: Pilots: No updates / Announcements. Cabin Crew are uninterested uncaring and rude. Overall hopeless and frustrating airline.
2445,A horrible experience travelling from Toronto to Paris. Flight attendants didn't speak proper English and couldn't understand me. They just threw my food into my lap as I was trying to wake up and open my table and quickly walked away. They would walk around really fast and disappear for a long time probably hoping to avoid contact with passengers. I had to press the flight attendant button almost 6 times to get a glass of water. Food was okay but the fact that flight attendants were so bad just made the trip horrible. This was the first and last time I'll take Air France!
2446,I flew from Stockholm Arlanda to Paris CDG on the 11th February. It was a very pleasant flight. Probably my best medium-haul flight with Air France. The staff was very nice and helpful. I think that the meal proposed could have been better it was very bit tasty. A large choice of beverages.
2447,We have just returned from our first long haul flight with Air France and it was not a pleasant experience. The new Airbus 380 have next to no leg room in economy I'm only 5' 9'' and yet was cramped. Luckily I had an aisle seat and could put my legs into the aisle so long as I didn't trip anyone. The inflight meals were cold yes even the hot ones. The steward serving my wife tried three separate servings all cold and gave up. We did the return leg with KLM and for it to be part of the same company was amazing as it was the opposite good staff good food and reasonable leg room all be it on a different type of aircraft.
2448,Flew FRA-CCU-FRA in January 2014 changing planes in Delhi both ways. All sectors by new 787s except for CCU-DEL which was on a respectable old A321. All flights reasonably on time. FRA-DEL delayed 45 minutes but as there was nothing much to do in transit in DEL I didn't care and DEL-FRA delayed by 30 minutes as waiting for a connection but we still made our train from FRA with 10 minutes to spare. Check-in personnel friendly and helpful in both FRA and CCU all plane interiors clean including toilets pleasant food. Excellent in-flight map display on the 787s. A few niggles: on one of the 787s my AC power socket didn't work and the audio feed to my seat was dead.
2449,As stated elsewhere the seats/condition of planes are very poor. However there seems to be more legroom. The international flights often come out a lot cheaper - so accept poorer conditions for economy! However the worst part of the flights I've done is the security at an Indian airport. It's atrocious and to be avoided if possible. My last trip travelling from Bangkok to London took more than an hour and that was on airside. To make it more infuriating my hand luggage was searched 4 times and not one was a decent/thorough search - more like they were going through the motions! I will not fly with an Indian stop over any more and would rather pay a little more to avoid it.
2450,Jan 7 2014 MAA-DEL-BHX-MAA. Departure on time though on an old A320 cabin crew attentive and food was good. Connection at DEL was 1.5 hrs which was quite decent timing security again at DEL needs to be streamlined-some customer service skills for the security personnel. DEL/BHX on new Dreamliner seats most comfortable compared to competing airlines. Electronic centrally controlled tinted windows a definite hit in Air India Dreamliners - peaceful sleep food very good but limited drinks in Economy - no wine served. Landing good severe delay in baggage collection waited 45 minutes. I would definitely fly Air India B777 again.
2451,I recently flew on the MAA-DEL-SYD leg. At Chennai airport for an A320 flight they had only 3 operating check-in counters whilst planes from other airlines had 5-6 counters. This led to long delays and lengthy queues. The Air India ground staff at New Delhi airport seemed to be helpful in helping the passengers getting to their connecting flights. The Dreamliner for the Delhi - Sydney leg seemed to be a good one. The flight was delayed by 3 hours due to 3 stewards reporting sick at the last moment and they had to bring in replacement crew. The announcements were spotty and not easily forthcoming. The food served was tiny in portion with only one round of drinks offered for a 12.5 hour journey. The IFE was limited but worked. The toilets didn't have any amenities for a long-haul flight. The punctuality and the unreliability of this airline would make one say never again.
2452,Business class CDG to IAD older 777 with a seat that when extended into the sleeping position pinched my feet because it was improperly aligned the food was unappetizing and the sauce spilt from the serving cup onto the entire plate. The service was haughty. In general a pedestrian airline that charges top dollar for its product. Cannot compare to Turkish business class which is generally 30 % or more less expensive.
2453,Paris-Lagos on 2 Feb 2014. Very pleasant flight. Cabin crew were very friendly premium economy seats were comfortable with a lot of leg space. I'm a frequent long haul flyer with Air France and I have noticed major improvements in Air France flights in the past couple of years specially for flights heading to Asia and Africa.
2454,Despite all the bad reviews about Air-France it is still the only Airline in the world who offers French Champagne (not cheap bubbly) for aperitif and Cognac after your meal no other airline does this! Recently flew from CDG to Kuala Lumpur and both flights were great with a service minded and friendly crew. Glad both flights were not full and the cramped 10 across seats on the Boeing 772 didn't feel too bad.
2455,"BKK-DEL-BHX on 9th December and you do get what you pay for (not a criticism)! We left BKK on time and the first leg was around 4 hours on a fairly old A320 which looked a bit shambolic but did the job. Staff were almost comically surly as a first impression although once you engaged a bit they got better. They dealt with some very rude passengers so in the end we sympathized them more than anything. There was simply no IFE at all but I had brought a book so that didn't make too much difference. The pilot guided us very well through a long patch of turbulence and we slowed right down near landing in response to fog at Delhi. Overall it was pretty poor but pilot seemed experienced and we got there safely so not complaining. The connection was ok and we had a slight delay due to aforementioned fog but this time we were on the 787 dreamliner. Lovely modern aircraft with decent IFE but nowhere near as good as Emirates though a lot is invested in Bollywood stuff. The toilets could have done with cleaning. The food was reasonable with the lamb curry on the first flight the best and all were passable if not great. Staff were a little more enthusiastic on the 2nd flight which was good although the audible ""bing"" sound every time anyone requested crew assistance was unnecessary. Staff were reasonably attentive and drinks were available throughout. I would recommend as it's value for money."
2456,FRA-DEL-MAA return during the festive season on 787 and A320 on the domestic sector. Booked 9 months in advance to get a good price for the peak season and felt it was good value because everything was perfectly fine with the Dreamliner (seat pitch cleanliness meals staff service with a sense of humour at times good on-time performance IFE). The domestic sector was served by an older single-class A320 which was far inferior to the Dreamliner but the staff were good both ways and served hot meals during the 2 1/2 hr flight. Cannot fault Air India in any way and loved the Bollywood films onboard the 787. However the transit arrangements at Delhi International Airport are a nightmare which easily bring the spirits down after a good flight. Air India management should work closely with the authorities to make transit arrangements flexible because their European flights (LHR CDG FRA) as well as Melbourne/Sydney seem to depart within an hour. Too much chaos and too frustrating really.
2457,London-Delhi-Bangkok return in business class. Got a very good deal back in May which was only Â£100 more than my usual Etihad economy trip in economy for the dates. There were some good points to the trip but several bad points to mention. All flights on time except last leg back to Heathrow that was compensated though by my bag being first off. Lounge quality was varied which I'll review separately. LHR-Delhi on B777 - very good seat for sleeping (slept probably 7 hours) though privacy lacking. Good choice of drink selection but food for business class very poor in both presentation and quality. No amenity kits on board for overnight flight. Entertainment on demand but western choice limited with only 3 recent films. Delhi-BKK. Poor all around for a 4 hour flight except the seats were wide and drink choice good again (malt scotch whisky). As noted before chicken or veg should not be the default option for business class and the quality of both was poor even for airline food. No immigration forms on board and fast track vouchers only offered on landing after numerous requests from passengers. Entertainment system on the A321 from the 1990's - no on demand and a choice of 5 channels 1 English. Ended up watching an Indian cop movie. BKK-Delhi - more of the same but breakfast of better quality. Delhi - BKK - although late best of all the legs with attentive cabin crew calls answered on request for drinks a good quality meal this time. Still could see the cost cutting with the amenity kit in business class being a cheap pair of flight socks and eye mask. No explanation given either of 90 minute delay. Will not be returning even considering the cost paid.
2458,Flew from Shillong to Kolkata. Check in and cabin staff were pleasant and the flight was on time but the state of the plane: broken seats frayed seat belts all the panels were grimey the carpet was worn out. I hope the vital parts of the plane were better maintained.
2459,Kuala Lumpur to Paris Feb 2nd 2014 AF241 and flight AF1286 Paris to Edinburgh 3rd Feb 2014. Very agreeable staff good choice of entertainment but very poor catering for coeliac passengers. Very disappointing compared to sister airline KLM who on way out from Edinburgh to Kuala Lumpur via Amsterdam had provide beautifully cooked meals and excellent gluten free bread rolls. Air France options very poor in comparison and no bread rolls.
2460,Flew from Toronto to Paris on Boeing 777 seats were small and uncomfortable. Checking in at Toronto airport at KLM/Air France counter was a disaster. Long line ups and poor customer service. I wasn't able to check in online or at the self service kiosk due to the infant. Flight attendants disappear after they quickly serve the meal. I requested a special meal which was very small and I was still hungry. Meal was about a half cup of rice with a finger size fish fillet. No flight attendants to be seen until a snack was served half hour before landing. A small muffin with juice. Coming back from Paris to Toronto was pretty much the same story - uncomfortable seats no service and small meal.
2461,"LIN-ORY-FDF return. Premium Economy is a great compromise between business and economy especially with AF B777s which squeeze 10 rows across in economy and is unbearably claustrophobic especially on the Caribbean routes when they cram in 468 passengers in a B777-300ER (more than a B747). Premium is great service excellent (same service and food as business). Premium seats very comfortable slide forward rather than recline pitch 36"" on their B777-300ER Caribbean routes (other routes it is 38"") but the width and armrests make a huge difference and the TV screens same as business. Entertainment system is old and needs modernising however. Having travelled in the past in AF business I wouldn't recommend it (slanting flat bed is rubbish!) but would definitely travel premium again. Well done AF great staff attitude improvement in the last few years too."
2462,AF256 CDG-SIN. The return flight was a bit better due to a more pleasant set of crew although I do feel the level of engagement with passengers is lacking and crew members just doing the minimal task of serving the 2 meals quickly and then disappearing in between meal service which makes up a good part of the long flight. The real problem with AF is their planes - just not comfortable for long haul - cramped seating 3-4-3 in a 777 aircraft in a full flight feels suffocating crowded very unpleasant and the inflight entertainment needs a major upgrading - small screen with blurry images that keeps hanging and limited selection. There is also no extras like an ice cream after main meal or selection of snacks and fruits in between meals. In fact the food served is terrible one of the worst ever experienced. I was left very tired and hungry. The scrambled eggs served for breakfast was so overcooked and heated it was like puddle of yellow mud with a small sausage looking awkward in the mess. I think it gives the impression of no care given. That about sums up my experience with AF. Until they improve on the service and product best to look for other options.
2463,AI 234 from Gaya (GAY) to Kolkata (CCU) by A319 VT-SCI. Flight delayed nearly 45 minutes. IFE was switched off for the whole duration and we were served only 2 cookies and a bottle of water. As usual there was a duplication of seats allocated for some passengers which led to some chaos. The only reason I travel AI is because of its ample legroom for a person of 180 cm like me. And the reason I chose this flight was because of the cheap fares available (2k per head) on the domestic leg of international flights (this flight operates as Yangoon-Gaya- Kolkata). Overall an uneventful flight minus the 45 mins delay.
2464,I travelled from Mangalore to Mumbai on 28 December. Flight was delayed 20 minutes and we were promptly alerted of this at Mangalore airport. Check in was smooth and I received the seating of my choice. Boarding was chaotic. One Air India ground staff member announced that boarding would commence for rows 1 to 15 while another commented that boarding would start from rows 16 onwards. This obviously resulted in a confused queue of people. The welcome on board was pretty average however the seating (comfort and leg space) was just fantastic a luxury I had not experienced with other airlines lately. Only tea/coffee cookies and a bottle of water was served which is really appalling given that this is a 12:50 pm departure. Thankfully I had carried a sandwich with me as I had read about the cookies in another review. Flight was delayed 30 minutes overall however there was no announcement made by the captain nor any other announcements about arrival in Mumbai the weather etc. Overall disappointing except for the comfortable seating.
2465,AI 112 LHR-DEL. Check-in fast at a very crowded and pushy LHR Terminal 4 pre-Christmas. Plane left punctually. Crew polite but a little surly but put that down to just the 'Indian way'. Comfy big seats in Executive Class and 100% flat beds in 777-300. The cabin was quiet throughout the duration of the flight. Magazines only offered to first cabin? Crew could not work out my gluten free meal and kept having to replace my tray after serving. Cabin was too hot during shut-eye time and no waters handed out before sleeping. Amenities kit just socks and an eye mask however asked crew for toothbrush/paste which they supplied immediately and then left a pile in the toilets. IFE a bit of a joke?? terrible amateur looking interface which is a nightmare to use. Moving maps didn't work until the final half and hour of the flight?¦handy! This was a connecting flight via Delhi to Bangkok - see following review.
2466,JNB-CDG 4th February. Short haul is pleasant enough and efficient (though avoid Paris Charles de Gaulle if at all possible Orly is a delight). Long haul (A380 economy) was a short haul experience on a long haul flight. I found the seats were thinly padded and barely reclined food short-haul standard. Where the French no doubt find the cabin crew efficient and focused as a Brit I found them professional but stand-offish and unwelcoming. No > concept at check-in of spreading the passengers round the cabin to give everyone a bit more space. An uncomfortable and not particularly pleasant flight.
2467,CDG-MAN-CDG Economy A321. Both legs on-time. Domestic flight configuration with seats not reclining but decent legroom. Good choice of newspapers upon boarding snack and beverage service - sufficient for a one-hour-flight. Surprised that wine and even gin tonic were available on the short flight! Cabin crew professional and friendly. Ticket fare rather competitive. Would fly AF again on short-haul flights.
2468,"HAV-CDG Economy. 2 adults (couple). ""Due to full flight"" we did not get adjacent seats which couldn't be changed - well nobody made a serious effort neither at check-in (2 hrs prior to boarding time) not at the gate. Aircraft an 747-400 which was pretty worn-down. No choice of food offered for dinner. Friendly cabin crew. Long-haul in economy AF is just a 3* airline so don't expect too much."
2469,"AI 332 DEL-BKK. AI lounge in DEL is fine but just don't expect too much non-Indian cuisine. Terrible wifi with a very confusing sign-up process. Showers working clean and enjoyed after connecting flight from LHR. Final call made to rush passengers on board only to be met with a massive queue in the various walkway bridges so not the best first impression. A321 business class seats were good and the way business class seats should be - real business class seats and not 'adapted economy' ones. Cabin crew definitely surly however once smiled at they immediately smile back. Drinks service was fine however only given a packet of French-fry style crisps seemed a bit amateur for executive class. My pre-ordered gluten-free meal left the crew somewhat perplexed and I was met with the response ""veg or no veg"" as an option. 'No veg' was nice enough however the chicken main contained only 3 small chunks of meat. The IFE was not on demand and the cabin was very hot and stuffy throughout most of the flight. We arrived in BKK early however there wasn't a single landing card to be found on the plane which quickly cancelled out any early arrival gains!"
2470,SYD-DEL-SYD. Flight was delayed by 6 hours. Staff very casual in attitude and lacked professionalism. Staff behaviour not the same with all passengers. Food quality and quantity was below average. Saw the drinks trolley just once in a 13 hour flight. No refill of drinks was offered. However plane was modern very nice and comfortable. Seats were comfortable and ample leg space. Inflight entertainment was nice. Don't mind giving them another try and then will decide whether or not to travel AI. I hadn't set very high expectations. There is a lot of room for improvement. Crew need to be trained to be more polite courteous and professional.
2471,Chicago to Delhi in First class. The ticket cost almost 2x business class in a European carrier but I chose it due to the direct nature of the non-stop flight. What a mistake. The first class product is very poor seats uncomfortable and felt like sitting on a metal rod. Cabin service was pathetic with a poor choice of drinks and food. And most shocking is Air India has stopped giving toiletry bags. If you are going to fork out the money do it on Qatar or British Airways.
2472,AF 422 CDG to BOG. AF 423 BOG to CDG. SEAT 01F/3K. A340. In business for all flights. This was my second Business Class flight in a month with AF having travelled LCY-AMS-BKK. BKK-CDG-LHR in late November 2103. The staff are always accommodating and friendly the food good and plentiful the seats on the A340's comfortable and all flights were on time. My biggest complaint for a very long haul flight is that the IFE is not good enough for the price the Business traveller pays for the entire package. It is lacking functionality and lacks any decent programming content. Simply not on par with BA/Virgin etc. I had browsed most of the IFE on my previous return long flight BKK to CDG and to my horror same old so called entertainment system on both legs of CDG-BOG and BOG- CDG. Looking forward to a trip to Lima Peru in March but not with Air France.
2473,MVD-EZE-MVD - C class Boeing 777. Surprised for a short flight. Great check in and well mannered staff on board staff all good and smooth.
2474,TLS-CDG-DUB-AMS-TLS. Two of the four flights were late for no obvious reason. Luggage was lost on the way to Dublin and it took AF 12 hours to send the luggage despite frequent flights between CDG and DUB. Delay on DUB-AMS resulted in unscheduled overnight in AMS. Unfriendly and indifferent staff all the way. AF/KLM makes no effort to get passengers on their next flight if the incoming flight is delayed. Got a hotel voucher in AMS for a hotel which is up to one hour away from the airport (40min waiting time for the bus + 15 min to get there). You also have to queue twice when you lose your connection: once to get your new boarding pass and again to get your hotel voucher. And finally I got numerous messages that my baggage was lost on AMS-TLS as well despite the fact that I found it eventually on the conveyor belt. Silver status on AF/KLM is worth nothing as I got seats in the last row or middle seats allocated.
2475,DEL-CDG with connection within Europe return. The long distance flights were excellent especially the daytime return flight to Delhi. The lounge in CDG is excellent and the food on the flight was superb better than any other airline I have taken in years. Seat although not totally flat was comfortable and the entertainment system was good. Crew were professional. The European flights were without personality operated by Hop! with no real food or service. Long distance AF I found better than Lufthansa or Emirates business. But I find that economy is the acid test most first world airlines have good long distance business class it's economy short haul where they lose it.
2476,"Acceptable, but cabin showing it's age. Seats are a little tight, but good recline. Overhead Flight Map and Inflight Magazine acceptable for 2 hour flight. Water and a Baguette - stay away from the Tuna-fish Sandwich, the turkey one is fine. A big disappointment from their previous offerings. It would be better to stop serving rolls and replace them with a snack (peanuts, chips, ect) and soft-drink instead."
2477,Singapore to Amritsar with a transit in Delhi. The domestic flights were much better than the international flights in every aspect. Upon check-in the officials insisted that our luggage had to be checked out in Delhi and checked in again when the final destination for the luggage was clearly stated as Amritsar on the luggage tags. The same happened on our way back. My 83-year-old grandmother was with me and she has difficulty walking so we requested for a wheelchair for her. Due to this we were the last to get off so that my grandmother had more time and could get off slowly. When we landed in Delhi from Singapore for transit there was a delay in bringing in the wheelchair and the female flight attendant who was apparently in a hurry to get off told my grandmother to walk out and wait outside the plane for the wheelchair. Domestic flight attendants showed more care and were very accommodating towards my grandmother. In-flight entertainment was not working to Delhi and there was no in- flight entertainment to Singapore on the old plane which was quite run-down. Our flight to Singapore from Delhi was on 16th Dec 12.05am and we landed in Delhi on 15th Dec after 4pm for transit. When we tried to enter the international airport the security officials refused to let us in asking us to come back 24 hours later as the date written on our boarding pass was 16th Dec. They refused to listen when we explained our flight was 5mins after midnight. We went to the Air India customer service counter where there were other passengers with the same problem. She simply told us to keep our boarding pass and show them our booking confirmation instead which we did and the security did not accept. The customer service officer refused to come out of her counter and speak to the security officials for us. We managed to enter the airport 3 hours later. We also had to request for wheelchair assistance again and the customer service officer told us to wait while she went to get the wheelchair. After making us wait for 40 mins she returned with 2 cups of coffee and no wheelchair. Upon entering the international airport there was a whole new problem with the Air India officials. On reaching Singapore we realised that there was no communication within Air India for the wheelchair assistance. The air stewardess instead told us off that we should have requested for assistance earlier which we did repeatedly. Overall the experience with them was horrible as they created inconvenience for us every step of the way but certainly eye-opening to see that their service could be of this standard.
2478,I was travelling on an executive class ticket on flight AI 047 from Kochi to Delhi on 9th Dec was disgusting. A very old A320 in all economy configuration. Cabin smelt of stale sweat and was incredibly hot. Of 3 toilets one was shut up with packing tape and looked like it had been for some time. The other 2 were filthy and stank of urine by the time we got to Delhi the floor of the front one had been covered in newspaper to soak up 'liquid'. At least on 3rd class Indian Railways you would not have had windows! My seat had a table located in the armrest it and its housing were filthy. The other armrest had a liftable cover and filled with food scraps and wrappers. Complaints to crew onboard and on the Delhi transfer desk were met with shrug and ignoring you.
2479,Flight 1904 CDG (Paris) to FCO (Rome) January 16 2014. I was unable to select a seat on the Air France website or by phone. However during my short layover in Paris the ticket counter person gave me a nice seat (10A). The seat was above-average and I was able to sleep comfortably during most of the flight. The FAs were competent. The complimentary snack they provided was good: sandwich and small bottle of wine.
2480,CDG-JFK. Very positive flight experience. New airplane with comfortable seats decent food friendly FAs.
2481,Singapore-Paris on AF257. Plane was an old 777 not in great shape. Unpleasant smell and not very clean. Seats very cramped and awful for a long flight. Food terrible one of the worst experienced. Service from crew feels cold and distant. No service of drinks/water in between meals one has to go to the back galley for self service for water and snacks - which was also awful limited choice. Crew literally disappears for most of the flight a good 10 hours and appear only 2 hours prior to arrival for breakfast service. Inflight entertainment is a sad looking small screen with blurry images and poor sound system and even worse limited selection of shows. Really I wish there was more positive things I can say about this flight - but it was overall a great disappointment - you know it's not good when you feel like you just want the flight to end quickly and keep looking at the time wishing it will go faster so you can get out! This flight made me feel depressed very tired very hungry and I kept wishing I had taken Singapore Airline or even Emirates on this route.
2482,LAX-CDG on A380 and from CDG-CMN on A320. One of the worst routes I've had. I was shocked with their service cleanliness and seats although I bought a seat plus! I was very disappointed with what they call a seat plus and I don't recommend anybody pay for them as they are not worth it. The seats were very uncomfortable we were sitting in the first row the TV screen that comes out from the side of the seat was not aligned in a way where you can watch comfortably and there were no window as shown on the seat plan. The flight attendants were the rudest I've seen on a plane. Bathrooms were not clean food was ok. On the way back though it was different. The seats were good on the A380 the seat was in the upper deck and was not a seat plus it was much better then the seat plus. The flight attendants on both flights from CMN to CDG and from CDG to New York were very friendly and helpful. The food was better on the return flight as well.
2483,"Long waits and delays, poor check in service, they had lost our booking. If you try to eat the cardboard bread roll you'll need the bottle of water, take your own inflight movie, as there is none."
2484,"KM4207, KM4206. 26th May - 2nd June 2015. Quite disappointed really with mix up and confusion. Flew from Cardiff, five of us travelling to Malta, got to check in and told that if we all want to sit together they would charge Â£25 per person. Lots of customers complaining! If you request extra leg room at a cost you will be in charge of the emergency exit, no one with any disabilities or under 16 cannot sit in these rows. I had a 14yr old and she was moved!"
2485,ORY to MLA and MLA to LIN. When I purchased the Air Malta flight ticket it stated a hot meal will be provided. But onboard I only received a bread roll and a bottle of water. I don't understand why this airline decided to downgrade their service it is not much different to travelling on a budget airline except you get a refreshment and a free piece of baggage. The aircraft livery is beautiful seat was comfortable for a short haul journey the only thing that might make me use them again is the location of airport they fly to.
2486,Of 4 flights over 6 weeks 3 were ok 1 was disgusting. BHX to DEL and DEL to LHR on 787 were good service on new clean aircraft with good crew DEL to MAA on a 319 was newish clean aircraft with good crew. Food service could be improved by not putting a tray in front of crammed with lots of cling film covered bowls. I do a separate review of the disgusting flight. Better selection of English language films would be appreciated.
2487,"Atlanta to Paris twice in December 2013. On both the Atlanta-Paris flights the first immediate sensation upon boarding the plane was the strong stench of urine. Imagine suffering that for the first 2-3 hours of the flight. On the Air France flight from Paris to Bangalore at takeoff the door to one of the four toilets was already taped up and marked ""unusable"". 3 hours into the flight the one across from it got clogged up leaving only two operating toilets for the entire Economy section. The food was terrible not even properly heated up. There were no snacks brought out by staff. The seats have no cushioning left completely worn out. The quality of service has decreased a lot over the past 2 years."
2488,BKK-CDG. This was my first flight with Air France (and last). What a big disappointment it was. On a 12.5-hour flight I thought we would be served plenty of food and drink. First serving was ok but after that the service was extremely poor. The cabin crew sat in the galley chatting with each other the whole trip. I bothered the staff by asking if i could get a glass of juice and some snacks. I could not believe what I heard when they said that they had run out juice snacks and sandwiches. Second serving came about two hours before landing or nine hours since we last ate so we were really hungry but the food was pitiful and inedible. The only positive thing on this flight was the IFE. I strongly advise against traveling with Air France but if you do it despite this warning don't forget to bring sandwiches with you.
2489,CDG-PVG (Shanghai). I got a good deal probably as it was a China Eastern code share. On time in both directions. Upgraded to Premium Eco on their A380 on the way out. Spacious aircraft good service pretty good IFE good range of drinks including champagne (digestifs on the menu but they don't come around to offer it) but the food is rather bland. Breakfast not very nice and nasty coffee served with powdered creamer. I woke up 3/4 of the way through the flight due a sore bottom - disappointing that the Prem Eco seats on a new aircraft should be so uncomfortable. Return on an older B777 in economy was actually more pleasant - felt more airy well maintained if a bit worn but cosier somehow with more comfortable seats. Not well equipped for China despite now flying to four destinations and partnering with MU. Only one interpreter aboard no Chinese-speaking cabin attendants. Problematic for a few passengers. Also transferring in PVG is a pain - you need to clear immigration customs and then check-in again (you might have to wait for it to open if longer than 4 hours before departure). This took 2 hours on the way out. Day stopover on the way in but I had to put my bag in left luggage as they can't check it through. Decent product work to be done.
2490,20/2/2015-23/2/2015. Flight KM 612 to Rome KM 613 to Malta. I have flown with Air Malta from Malta to Rome Fuimicino and return to Malta. The flight was OK but food was very poor. The service which was provided in Rome was very bad: at the check-in the machine did not know how to fill in the boarding pass normally Be aware: a lot of students are flying on this route and they make a lot of noise especially during boarding.
2491,Travelled to and from Malta this month. We cannot understand how the market research dept. have come up with the plan to remove the hot meal from this service. We travelled 2 hours to the airport 2 hours waiting and a 3.5 hour flight landed us in Malta about 11.30pm. All this time without a meal! I think it's Easyjet next time.
2492,LGW to MLA and return - January 2015 - A320 both ways. Although online check in used there was no dedicated bag drop at LGW which somewhat defeats the point when you have to line up with those who have not checked in. Outbound flight left 10 minutes early and landed 25 minutes ahead of schedule. Air Malta have now discontinued a full meal service in favour of what they describe as a baguette and a bottle of water. The baguette is actually a small soft roll with very little filling. Due to a cabin crew dispute over crew meals being discontinued no hot or cold drinks or snacks could be bought. On the return the dispute has been resolved and a selection of cold snacks hot drinks and full bar service available at prices slightly lower than most low cost carriers. Return was about 15 minutes late. As both flights were lightly booked there were plenty of free seats which made the trip note comfortable but A320's are showing their age.
2493,Manchester to Malta A319 22nd December 2014. Check-in was slow which was a bad start and it got worse. Our economy seats had minimal legroom and when the passenger in front put his seat back just after take-off I was trapped. There was no entertainment system other than a map showing the planes location and the meal of chicken curry with a bread roll and tiny mince pie was embarrassingly poor. For a scheduled flight it was pretty bad and the best bit was leaving the plane on arrival at Luqa.
2494,29/10/2013 Birmingham-DEL. Chaos at check-in as I did online check in and the system provided online boarding pass. Check in desk unsure of this new facility and finally provided manual boarding pass. Slight delays but landed on time at Delhi. Good flight on Dreamliner - seats in economy the best I have flown less noise good food less choice of drinks no wine. Staff need to be cheerful. DEL-Chennai connection was chaos Delhi airport connection: security was long and horribly slow. Connecting flight was delayed 1 hr - no proper information staff were simply sitting at the boarding gate. A320 OK-No coffee due to boiler problem. Surprising all my baggage arrived safely at Chennai.
2495,Flight 114 from Birmingham was not so great 3.5 hrs late. Departure time was 5.30pm but departed at 9.40pm. When we were boarding the plane looked great however upon take off there were problems. They did not have any vegetarian dishes they came back with bread rolls and butter for the rest of the flight. When we got to Delhi we were delayed a further 4hrs due. Poor flight and service.
2496,Flew from Bahrain to Delhi. Flight took off and landed on time. The plane was in good condition and was well kept. Seats were comfortable and there was ample leg room. Inflight service was excellent. Young cabin crew servicing this flight - they were all polite respectful and attentive. Food was good Indian - tasted great - however not much options for non-Indian travelers. Inflight entertainment was satisfactory - had mostly Bollywood films and a few Hollywood flicks- slightly outdated. Overall great flight. would definitely recommend and fly again.
2497,KIX-CDG. Flight departed on time and after the terrible and insufficient meal service attendants passed and lowered all window blinds I refused to close mine (the main reason I chose this flight though I know how mediocre AF is was exactly because I wanted to avoid a night flight) and 3 different attendants came to ask me (politely though) to close it since most passengers wanted to either sleep (it was 2 in the afternoon) or watch a film. Most windows shields were only opened upon landing this is 10 hours later! During the second meal service (even worse than the first one) a hostess dared wake up the passenger sleeping next to me in order to offer him a tray . I consider this a lack of respect. I read that they are trying to raise their standards in order to match the Gulf and other Asian airlines but they still have a very long way to go.
2498,A380 JFK-CDG-VRN and back. The service was very good on both flights. Flight attendants were very polite attentive and friendly. All requests were given promptly. The check-in escort experience at JFK was very good. The agent visited me in the lounge to make sure everything was ok engaged in small talk escorted me to the plane and introduced me to the FAs. The food on flight out of JFK was average for first class. The seat privacy may not be an enclosed suite but it is far enough from other seats to feel the privacy. I am not a privacy freak American anyway. IFE/TV may not be as good but it is not the thing I care since I rarely watch anything on the flights. Bed quality and size were very good. The lounge experiences in Paris is nothing to compare! Nothing comes close to Air France First Class Lounge experience. The design of the lounge is modern and tasteful. Everybody at Air France First Lounge was friendly attentive. They also leave you alone to give privacy but when you gave the sign that you need anything you get fast/polite/genuine responses. Every agents that will give me some service/escorts came to introduce themselves and engaged in small talks. The massages were very good. The food and wine were also the highlight. Food quality/presentation/taste and service were on par with top restaurants. The Limo escorts to the flights were very nice and made me feel like a king. The agent from the first visit remembered my return flight to JFK. While he couldn't be there that day he sent over another agent to come say goodbye and wished me a good flight while I was seated on the plane. CDG-JFK service was even better the FAs were very professional genuinely friendly and attentive. The food out of CDG was much better. Arrival escort at JFK was good. She walked with me all the way outside to send me off with Delta Agent for my connecting flights. All in all the best experience I ever got in first class.
2499,AF 184 CDG-HKG with Boeing 777. Seat plus in Economy class on Emergency exit so plenty of space for the legs. Food was ok not gourmet-cuisine but a lot (snacks dinner sandwich ice cream snacks breakfast). Crew very nice. I was expecting a horrible long flight it actually turned out to be one my most enjoyable AF flights in Economy. On the other hand Flight back to Paris with KLM on the old 747 half cargo was a bad joke.
2500,"Flew CDG-BKK-CDG with the awful Boeing 777-300ER (77W) that Air France is using on the BKK route. Just two words: never again! The seat is very uncomfortable and is announced 32"" pitch but I cannot understand how this is measured as you feel confined in a tiny space and your knees keep being hurt with the magazine holder. Forget if you are taller than 5'6"". For drinking and although AF advertises about Champagne even in Economy it was not possible to obtain more than a reduced choice of beverages and of course no Champagne. As I had ordered a vegetarian meal there was no wine with my dinner and the food was bland. Staff very ineffective and chatting loudly all the time in the galley never cleaning the cabin (some rubbish have been staying on the floor for 9 hours). IFE screen is very poor. A pity for more than 900 euros comparing with other airlines for instance Thai Airways that also has a direct flight. Maybe Premium Economy or Business classes are more comfortable but Premium Eco is double price and I do not think it is worth it."
2501,MLA-LHR. Flown Air Malta many times but this was by far my best experience. Same price as flying Ryanair. Crew very courteous breakfast was standard and impressed that a European airline still serves hot meals. Only downside in my opinion is that the aircraft are showing their age on the interior in particular the seats. They are only 10 years old but a cabin refit would have been of more benefit to the airline than the paint job they all had lovely though it is.
2502,An airline in recovery as Air Malta apparently is I genuinely wonder how things were before. Service aboard was what I can only describe as lack lustre. No welcome in boarding a 15 minute late start with no explanation from the flight deck or crew. A simple explanation is all people need. Surly cabin crew who I presume took inspiration from British Airways of old and for whom eye contact of any sort seemed to be an abominable sin so never occurred as a consequence. The food onboard was 'interesting' - Lamb kebab or nothing. There was a vegetarian option which wasn't freely offered. It's little wonder 'the airline of the Maltese Islands' were unhappy at the prospect and subsequent arrival of additional low cost airlines hitting their passenger load factors. Why any full fare paying passenger would select Air Malta for any other reason than bare price is beyond me. On a positive note once the aircraft was off the ground the actual flight was good the seats were comfortable cleaning regimes could be improved but that's not hugely consequential. Arrival at the destination was on-time and the onboard flight tracking information was good.
2503,"Newark-Mumbai in Business Class on a Boeing 777-300ER. The quality of Business class on Air India has really deteriorated. No amenity kits no menus no choice (sorry but ""veg"" or ""non-veg"" in business class is not very business class) presentation no better than economy class and even the quality of the offerings terrible. IFE offerings limited and one side of the cabin the IFE stopped working and the crew couldn't rejig it. On the plus side the cabin crew were polite helpful and considerate and the flat bed seats very comfortable."
2504,I was flying from Bangalore (BLR) to Melbourne (MEL) via Delhi (DEL). The first leg was on an Airbus A320 and the second on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The seats on both aircraft's had plenty of legroom. Though the in-flight entertainment on the A320 was not switched on the one on the Dreamliner was excellent. The cabin lighting on the 12 hour flight from DEL to MEL was perfectly set. The cabin crew service was excellent. The 3 meals (both flights combined) served was very good. Both flights were on time. Overall experience was fantastic.
2505,Fifth flight on AI665 since June all flights have been on time breakfast adequate. However its been noted since the last time the leg from BOM-IXE provides you only a couple of biscuits and tea. (Jet Airways on the other hand still gives you a proper snack). Overall no reasons to complain thus far.
2506,Ho Chi Minh to Paris seats in economy were good and the entertainment system was fine. We boarded on time and took off the cabin crew came round after an hour with first meal and it was ok. There was supposed to be a self service system on board but it apparently ran out of sandwiches and snacks. It was supposed to be haagen dazs ice cream but in fact it was a cheap type. The food running out is a disgrace and on such a long haul 12 hours it is the only flight I have been on with nothing to eat for 9 hours between meals. The crew could not be bothered.
2507,Flew LHR to BKK via CDG (Economy) December 2013. Seats very narrow on Boeing 777 and less comfortable than seats on British Airways EVA and Thai Airways which I have used on flights to Bangkok previously. IFE was OK. Food outbound to BKK was good with good wine and cheese. On the return journey back from Bangkok the food was poor with some type of very fatty meat as a main course that I (and my wife) could not eat or even identify. Furthermore after the main meal it was a long long time until breakfast was served leaving myself and my fellow passengers hungry. I later established that snacks were available if you made your own way to the galley to collect them but this availability was not announced and by the time I realised (whilst visiting the toilet) all of the sandwiches and most of the ice creams had gone (NOT acceptable). Cabin crew were pleasant and polite but did not seem proactive in any way and (to me) this was evidenced by the fact that they did not bother to serve the snacks or make any announcement as to their availability. The interconnection at CDG was pretty seamless and posed no problem at all. Given the narrow and uncomfortable seats and the poor catering and associated service on the aircraft I would not recommend that you use this airline for this journey unless BA / EVA / Thai are all significantly more expensive for your chosen dates.
2508,LAX-CDG-LAX. A positive experience. On par with the best European carriers. A380 upper deck seats are not state-of-the-art but basically lie-flat and do the job. Big entertainment screen with great options. Service was excellent; lots of smiles and effort to make comfortable. Food was better out of Paris than LA. On return flight plane's engine broke before take-off and airline put all passengers up at hotel for the night; business class got The Holiday Inn. The airline tried their best during a chaotic situation. Would fly again for sure.
2509,Brussels-Malta in business. Flight on time comfortable seats with the middle one free. Pitch between seats just ok for a 2hr 45 flight. Separation between economy and business bring some privacy. We were only 2 in business. Pleasant crew service and food above average with starter main course cheese and dessert. Quality has been met. Good champagne and selection of wine. I want to encourage the company to continue in proposing such a good service for a European business flight. Business class saver fare: 562 euros for a return ticket.
2510,FRA-MLA-FRA. Both flights on time. Impossible to make online check-in for flights from Frankfurt. Inbound flight from Malta was possible to make mobile check-in. They have a check-in counter for online checked-in passengers and no line exists. Another normal check-in counters are really long lines. Complementary chicken rice breads soft drinks and Maltese wines. Display on the ceiling was only flying map. Standard seat pitch on a legacy carrier.
2511,Gatwick-Malta. Online check which makes things easier. Air Malta offer inflight meals even though the flight is usually less than 3 hrs not many airlines do that any more. The price of the tickets was cheaper than Ryanair. Plenty of leg room comfortable seats cabin crew were pleasant enough.
2512,Air India needs to get back to basics and retrain staff what a miserable bunch. I have flown three times with them and there is not one good thing I can say about the flights. The last flight and it will be the last we travelled from Mumbai/Delhi/Singapore all that can be said about it was that we left and arrived on time. I decided that a fitting end to our stay in India would be to spend a couple of days at the Taj Hotel Mumbai we have done so for two years what a magic end to our India journey. But it wasn't the end - I had to endure the Air India flight and that left a nasty taste in our mouths.
2513,Dubai to Goa worst aircraft I have travelled on dirty scruffy broken parts. How can Air India be a National Airline? Inflight entertainment poor food poor flight attendants abysmal. Third world airline.
2514,I was a bit apprehensive before boarding as I read some very bad reviews of Air India but I must say my flight from Mumbai to Delhi on 31 October (AI601) was very good. We were on time flight attendants were really friendly and worked very hard and the breakfast was one of the best ever in my many years of travelling. Check in staff was friendly and gave me and my companions a big smile. I would travel with them again any time. So much better that many European airlines and as good as some Asian ones.
2515,I have been hearing horror stories about Air India and my recent trip proved that they are true. Travelled SHJ-COK on AI934 on 1st November. AI used 20 year old A320 (VT-ESH) with pealed off panels rattling windows and to make the journey worse there was no water in the toilets. Cabin crew were in no mood to work at all and after the food was served they ignored the calls from the passengers for service and were busy chatting to each other. This was the worst flight I ever had since my first flight in 1998 and I will never travel Air India again.
2516,Flew from Manchester to Kuala Lumpur changing at Paris CDG the outbound connecting flight was operated by flybe. We did not have seat details for this leg until check in and they seemed very perplexed at the check-in counter about what to do about onward flights in business class. The girl on the desk did not even know where KL was! After boarding the flight there was a problem with the plane and after a wait we were moved onto a different smaller plane and all allocated seat numbers then became obsolete and we ended up somewhere near the back. On the flight from Paris the choice of main course had run out before they got to us on row 7! The food was ok had better and had far worse maybe my expectations were rather high with it being a French airline. The cabin staff were very good. The seats were flat but slightly angled and as a result not quite as comfortable as could have been. I also found the fabric of the seat a bit on the scratchy side and ended up having to put a blanket between me and the seat to make it more comfortable for sleeping. Was surprised on the return leg to find the plane stopped away from the terminal and we had to be bussed in fortunately the plane was on time or this could have made catching our connection very tight. It was a very reasonable price and I would fly with them again if I could not get a good price from the likes of Emirates or Singapore airlines.
2517,Flew MAN-CDG-HAV return. The only problem was CDG see airport review. I will use this airline again but only for direct flights not via CDG.
2518,Flew CDG to PEK on new year's eve. Being a flying blue gold member I'd booked a seat by an exit for extra comfort (at no extra charge for gold and platinum members) but was reassigned to the back in the middle. When I protested and pointed out that I'd booked another seat I was told there was nothing they could do except buy an upgrade to premium economy. The staff was obviously not thrilled to be flying on December 31st and that reflected in their cold rather unfriendly demeanour but that attitude is nothing new to people who fly AF regularly. The worst part is the old outdated barely-hanging-on cabin interior. My IFE kept resetting and the screen kept shaking with 3 second gaps where it would go dark. The rest of the seat was threadbare and the magazine holder at the bottom of the front seat was broken so that a bit of metal kept biting into my knee. When I chose to stand for a while just because my neighbours were infringing on my personal space and because my knee was hurting I was told by a flight attendant to go stand at the back of the plane.
2519,Paris CDG to Shanghai in an A380 F-HPJH. Brand new A380 less than a year old. Very nice seat and entertainment program. Nice service very good and caring Chinese interpreter. food was great. The only problem was that the seat wasn't very good for sleeping.
2520,The only thing that was right was the time schedule. Seats were too close to one another I am only 165 cm tall and I barely had 3 cm left between my knees and the seat in front of me. Food was mediocre and the friendliness of the staff could be better. The seats with more space cost 50 euro per person per flight so were almost empty. The staff refused to allow taller passengers to take these seats unless they paid the full 50 euros. No more Air Malta for us!
2521,Outbound to Malta we were towards back on plane luckily an empty row behind us allowed guy in aisle seat to move and allow more room cramped seats terrible food and drinks charged at cost - stewardess did not bring back my change either! Take off was creaky and bumpy an old plane! On way out item was stolen from suitcase. Return back to London seat was further forward and even more cramped no leg room at all one guy in row ahead could not put his seat forward limiting room even more. On top of this the plane was extremely hot and the air con was not working properly. Very uncomfortable and sweaty could see most passengers suffering. Food was average. Flight itself smooth and fine.
2522,MLA-LHR-MLA. After a less than favourable review last month things improved significantly on this trip. Same crew were excellent on both legs and The UK Station Manager rang us on arrival at Heathrow to let us know one of our daughters had left their watch on the plane which was quickly retrieved and returned to us. Baggage arrival at LHR was surprisingly fast too. The Etihad lounge at LHR T4 remains Air Malta's trump card out of UK and on both legs we were not asked to weigh our hand luggage (as per last trip). A cynic might argue that having the Air Malta CEO onboard on the return flight may have helped matters but none the less the crew was attentive and the food more than bearable. Usual gripes about seat comfort remain but until Air Malta get new planes there is little chance of any improvement.
2523,AI 347 30 Sep 2013. Travelled on SIN-MAA route. The flight was on time. Take off and landing was smooth. Food served was fresh and good. The air hostesses were pleasant too. Sad to see they have taken out entertainment units from the SIN-MAA route. Overall a pleasant flight.
2524,I took Air India to Singapore and transit via two domestic airports at Kolkata and Chennai in October 2013. Aircraft's was dirty and old the seats were spoilt and not cleaned. The cabin crew were unfriendly. What was worst is that the co-ordination between Air India check in counter and the airport departure notifications were repeatedly inconsistent in all my connecting flights causing many confusion and at one connecting flight I was almost late and got reprimanded openly and loudly by the staff when I was already racing to the different gate (that was on a different floor from that indicated on the Kolkata airport terminal). Disappointing I had thought that this is a state airline and was anticipating better service.
2525,One of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. Although I've flown with the new Dreamliner from Delhi to Frankfurt the aircraft was in a disappointing condition. The cleanliness was poor the crew was rude incompetent and not very service oriented. At least the flight was cheap.
2526,BOS-CDG in business class on Boeing 777-200 F-GSPS. very old seats small screen compared to the new one. only one meal served no breakfast. seat comfort was all right. Overall very disappointing for business class.
2527,NRT-CDG-AMS-LCY/LHR-CDG-NRT in business for the long hauls and premium economy classes on the short hauls. This is my second Japan to Europe flight in a month with Air France and I was not disappointed. The staff are always accommodating and friendly the food good and plentiful the seats on the newer A380's comfortable (the older ones are a bit less so) and the connections easy in CDG. All flights were on time. My only complaint is that the seats in business are not lie flat but they are to be changing this on the newly renovated 777s in the coming year. The CDG lounge in the 2E M gates is truly spectacular as far as interior design goes though lacked any real food. Looking forward to yet another Air France trip in March.
2528,Flight from CDG to BKK economy seats were cramped and uncomfortable. Air France have gone for as many seats as possible even the cabin crew found it difficult to get the trolley through the very tight gangway. I will never fly Air France long haul economy again. Air France you need to revisit your seating plans.
2529,"Flew Edinburgh to Paris. Absolutely awful on an Avro in ""Premium Economy"". There's nothing premium about it except that you get the same food as business class - which isn't that special anyway. The seating is 3-3 and even for the normal sized it is very cramped - and the fares are obscene. If you must fly this route with air France/city jet either travel economy or business ""premium economy"" is nothing other than a gigantic rip off. Truly awful."
2530,Singapore to Mauritius. The crew were sleeping with covers on their head at the back of the plane which were far from a warm welcome I was expecting. However crew were helpful and fairly good for inflight service. Return leg did not meet my expectation - Air Mauritius delayed for 2.5 hours and was not helpful to change my connecting flight KL-Singapore. The ground staff in Mauritius was very poor in service for check in - took over 45 mins only for me.
2531,"Malta - LHR- Malta. Having had some very good trips with Air Malta recently this last trip showed a marked fall in standards. On outbound flight from Malta hand luggage was weighed (first time this has happened in business class) apparently due to ""a change in procedures"". My ten year old daughters were asked their age in the La Vallette lounge despite having business class tickets and there was little room for luggage by the time we boarded the plane. Breakfast on board was a sad affair with the nasty frankfurter sausage having made an unwelcome return. The Crew however were fine. The return flight out of LHR was less joyous. We were treated to an unintentional and lengthy display of origami by the check-in agent writing folding our lounge invitations (Why cannot the boarding passes simply be used for lounge access?) and a whole wad of questions about my wife's visa which is perfectly valid. Thank goodness for the Etihad lounge - a truly professional and quality experience but the joy ended there. The flight was full and service was very slow with dinner not being served until we were well over Nice. When it came the chicken was tough and overcooked and the dessert was unrecognizable either by looks or by taste. The stewardess was stretched whilst the purser sat behind the curtain doing absolutely nothing until late into the flight. Wine and Champagne were all served in tumblers (a pet hate) and the seats themselves are very uncomfortable for a flight where most passengers want to sleep. Priority luggage on Air Malta is also a joke when it comes off with all the other luggage. This is not unique to Air Malta but on a recent Emirates flight it really worked properly. Flying again on 23rd to London so keeping fingers crossed that things will improve."
2532,I'm just back from Malta having flown out and back from London Gatwick. Both flights departed promptly after smooth check in and boarding and arrived on time. Flying Airbus the seats were wider than I have experienced on recent economy flights with other airlines. The staff were friendly and the absence of attempts to sell unwanted items was appreciated. The provided means were pretty average but it was much cheaper to travel with them on my route than with Easyjet where food would have been an extra. I will certainly use them again and it is clear from a number of conversations that they have deservedly won many regular customers among the expat community.
2533,LGW-MLA and return. Outbound flight 40 minutes late departing but no explanation offered. A320 was showing its age seat leather worn and sagging. Legroom was reasonable. The standard of food has deteriorated considerably since my last Air Malta flight 5 months ago - cold ravioli swimming in watery sauce. Staff fairly efficient and friendly. Return A320 was in slightly better condition but my seat refused to stay upright and slowly reclined on its own. Again cooked breakfast was poor - back to the frankfurters with dry scrambled egg and potato. Again late departure with no explanation. The most alarming issue was the lack of final checks by cabin crew on landing - one passenger continued to use an ipad right up to landing!
2534,Flew from Bangalore to Goa - Flight delayed an hour but we were called and informed in advance. Aircraft was cramped. No entertainment considering the flight was going onwards to Dubai. The women crew were old and clumsy. No greeting while clearing trays. I really don't know why the even bother serving anything - two tiny biscuits and lukewarm tea. On the return flight was better more comfortable limited entertainment. Flight from Goa to Bangalore went via Pune and Hyderabad - small packet of peanuts and soft drink until Pune from Pune to Hyderabad two tiny biscuits and lukewarm tea and from Hyderabad to Bangalore - 2 biscuits and lukewarm coffee. This is supposed to be a full service airline! Would rather pay less and fly a low cost airline in future.
2535,AI112 from London to Delhi on AI112. The worst journey. The TV wasn't working lights were not working call button was not working and air hostesses were rude.
2536,AI 888 on 7 October - Mumbai to Delhi. A321. No boarding announcement made until an agent was already taking boarding passes. Friendly welcome on-board - about 45% full so plenty of room. Smooth take off and flight - dinner served and was good quality veggie or chicken curry. In-flight entertainment was only 5 channels and only 1 in English language. Landed and parked at a gate but disembarked via stairs on the right side of the plane - never done that before. Bus to the terminal and bag already coming out. Overall a good flight!
2537,Flew Air France to Jo'burg premium economy. The staff put BA and Virgin to shame. Pleasant helpful and very friendly. I would use again.
2538,London to Madrid with connections in CDG. I only flew this route with AF because it was cheap. All the flights were on time. The seats were comfortable staff friendly and very professional. The connections at CDG were very easy to make. I was very impressed.
2539,GIG-CDG-LIS return flight in economy class. Intercontinental flights in B747 with seats that are only comfortable if the flight is not totally full. Service in economy good for a 11 hour flight with dinner served after departure and breakfast at arrival. Cabin crew speak several languages and are available at anytime. Flights from CDG to LIS in A320 with uneventful service ok for a 2h30 flight. Drinks served and a little snack (cream crackers). I chose AF for the fares and definitely recommend them for intercontinental flights.
2540,Berlin-CDG. Old A320. Looking tired and old. PE = 2 rows behind 3 rows of Business separated by curtain from Economy. Seating = 3x3. Business also 3x3 with middle seat blocked. Purser looked after BC and PE. Drinks/food service in PE identical to BC. Wouldn't bother paying the additional to travel Business on such a short flight when PE has the same service. Appeared that Economy was not offered an alcohol service. Drinks were acceptable (champagne offered ) and food was above expectations. Neatly packaged tasty and well presented. 2nd beverage service offered with tea/coffee. Nothing seemed rushed on a short flight of 1hr 25mins. Would travel short haul AF Premium Economy again. As others have said seats hard and there was no inflight entertainment however not required for such a short flight.
2541,"We were pleasantly surprised by the service and overall comfort of the trip. The cabin staff were professional and friendly and the food and beverages top class. The accommodation arranged for us by Air Mauritius at the Airport Holliday Inn was top class. Thank you and well done, looking forward to our next trip on Air Mauritius later this year."
2542,My wife and I booked business class from Cape Town via Mauritius to Paris (return). The 5.5 hour flight from Cape Town to Mauritius was essentially in economy seats with an arm rest in between the seats with a partial recline. The 12 hour flight from Mauritius to Paris in a A340 was in a reclining seat except that it is not flat so you end up sliding down the seat with your feet getting squashed against the seat in front of you. The airline assured us that this leg of our journey had flat beds which is certainly not the case. The inflight entertainment is a non entity and probably the worst we have experienced.
2543,LHR-MUR return as experienced business travellers there are certain things we expect. We were originally flying BA until they changed the schedule meaning a loss of a days holiday unacceptable when you only have 7 so we changed to Air Mauritius which to be frank I was dreading! Check in fast and efficient fast track through customs as you would expect. As a small airline the lounge is shared with other airlines. A real let down next to no food choice wine etc ok Emirates it wasn't. Once on the plane business seemed reasonably comfortable until you try to sleep the seat doesn't lie flat but sloping to the floor. I'm 5ft 9 and my feet were rammed into the seat in front I didn't sleep a wink all night. Having said that food reasonable wine flowed nicely we couldn't get our TV to work my husband slept most of the way I had a very long night. Return ok lounge very nice food less appealing on the flight home very weird combinations we had 2 full dinners and afternoon tea halfway through. Got the TV to work this time but film selection rubbish.
2544,Manchester - Malta 20 Sep KM147. Malta - Manchester 27 Sep KM 146. Although the flights were both on time the legroom was non existent. Could barely read my book there was so little room. Staff OK and food not great. Will not be travelling on Air Malta again.
2545,1 Sep LHR-MLA KM101 Business class. 10 Sep MLA-LHR KM102 Business class. Great service and smiles from all seats very good for short haul food very good row 1 A and C both directions. Business lounge great and very quiet.
2546,Took two flights with Air Malta. One from Dusseldorf to Malta and Malta to Milan. First flight delayed for over an hour because they lost paperwork for two unaccompanied minors. They made those two girls stand for an hour and wait for the problem to be resolved. Second flight was delayed for over 4 hours. They didn't bother advising partners beforehand so we had to find out at our arrival at the Airport. Very poor customer service. I would not recommend the airline. Seats are filthy and old. Overall appearance of the aircraft is old and not in a good condition. I will not use this airline for my future travels.
2547,Traveled for the first time with Air India - MEL-DEL on 20th Sept 2013. I must say I was very impressed with service. Crew were excellent and so was the food. Dreamliner aircraft didn't disappointed me at all. Every need was attended to with attention.
2548,DEL-LHR on Dreamliner. This was a good flight. Two full meals - a hot breakfast after take off and a full lunch service about 3 hours before arriving in London. The food was actually better in quality and quantity than on Lufthansa which I took last month where the lunch was little more than a snack. South Indian hot breakfast and western main lunch course were both delicious. Flat seats on Dreamliner very good and Caire amenity kits which have more goodies than European airlines. I feel that Air India are missing some details and professionalism to make them really world class. For example the movies are not the latest and the entertainment system not intuitive The chocolates after the meal are of mediocre quality the male cabin crews uniforms look dated but generally the long distance product is not bad. Modern aircraft good food polite service clean bathrooms. Only details to complain about.
2549,AI 609. BOM-BLR. Check in and Security at Terminal 1A is a breeze compared to 1B out of which all the private airlines operate. Departed on time touched down about 15 min early. Cabin crew was their usual grumpy self. The main course was greasy as usual but the rest of the food was quite palatable.
2550,AI 608 from BLR to BOM. Very sparsely populated. Took off on time. Pilot seemed to be in a hurry to get home. Certainly flying a little faster than normal lot of buffeting throughout the flight. Touched down almost 30 min before scheduled time.
2551,Flew to Lisbon last minute so I was not able to get a non-stop flight. There were two legs to my trip JFK-CDG then CDG-LIS. Before I arrived at the airport Air France issued us one boarding pass that worked for both our flights. Flight scheduled to leave at 7.15. However the morning of the flight we received a notification that our flight had been delayed 2 hours. Upon arrival at JFK staff were very friendly and updated us. Lounge in JFK was the nicest I have seen excellent food spacious and comfortable. JFK-CDG was aboard an A380. Boarding took place through two gates so did not take as long as I thought made comfortable by the fact that Air France was sensitive to the boarding time and distributed drinks hot towels and an amenities kit while economy was boarding. Staff spoke excellent English and announcements were made in both French and English. Flight attendants were friendly the seats fully reclined and the pillow and blanket were comfortable. Plane was clean and bathrooms spacious. Individual TV's with plenty of choice. Passengers kept well informed throughout. Upon arrival in Paris immigration took about 5 seconds. A little disappointed with the lounge at CDG. Flight to Lisbon delayed 40 minutes. Flight aboard a B737. Service on this flight was surly. Overall I would definitely take the transatlantic flight again but would try to avoid the CDG-LIS flight.
2552,Booked seat Paris to Singapore months ago 2 seats together with my wife. 7 days before flight they change the seats my wife and I on separate sides of the plane. Contact Air France who refuse to change our seats. 4 days before our flight we find we have no seats allocated and are told we may get seats together when we check in. What a terrible way to treat customers. Their customer relations service is abysmal. Will not travel again with this company and hope that this information will make other people wary of travelling with this company.
2553,Flew to St Martin from Paris. We paid extra for the 'Ocean' inflight meal (Â£12 each). For this we got a starter with 4 prawns and a small forkful of crunchy vegetables followed by small cubes of salmon and rice. The bread and cheese was the same as the ordinary meal. No glasses were provided for the standard quarter bottle of wine. I had to ask twice for a glass. No mineral water was provided as was with the standard meal. The dessert was a soggy tart pastry base with some lemon flavoured mush on it. Bearing in mind we had already paid for a standard meal in the ticket price and were paying extra for this tray Air France should be ashamed for ripping us off in this way. The standard meal looked better than ours and had a glass and mineral water. Do not upgrade your meal. French cuisine? No way!
2554,Flew Cape Town - Mauritius - Perth Business class. The flight from CPT to MRU (A319) is more Premium Economy than business with extra legroom economy class seats (3) with the middle seat blocked. There is no individual IFE on this flight. MRU - Perth (A330) full business with slight inclining beds. Service was good and the food lovely and plentiful with matching wines. Business lounge at MRU airport very good. Would fly again.
2555,A pleasant surprise on this MUR-TNR flight in a 340. Comfortable seats (for a 2 hours flight but in no way a lie flat) nice staff proper food and wine. Much better than my previous flight NAI-MUR where I paid business fare to be seated on a coach seat (and the crew told me it has not changed): this is why I would not recommend this airline.
2556,The staff on the AM plane's do no more than the bare minimum service wise how many times does a customer have to ask for a glass of water? When you get the water its in a plastic cup and its warm! Their own pre flight customer care video states that consuming water is suggested for all flights! If only you could get it. Then there was the seating smelly old uncomfortable and zero leg room. I am 175cm tall and I was looking for space! We flew overnight leaving at 22.00 and the lights in the cabin were off for all of 3hrs in a 8hr flight! What also annoyed us was excessive the use of the PA! They love it everyone has a go the captain the assistant the FA captain and assistant and the toilet cleaner. Give it a rest no one listens to the announcements especially when we are trying to sleep!
2557,FCO-MLA and return in May 2013. Flew economy was pretty good with better than average legroom and seat padding and width. Flights were on time which is always a plus and even on these short flights a snack was served. Cabin crew was efficient but very serious in demeanour. All in all a good value and would fly again.
2558,What a lovely airline. Speedy check in and LHR - MLA business class and back economy but in row 10 with good leg room. Friendly and efficient both ways and totally on time.
2559,Flew LHR to Malta and return. Out on a A319 with plenty of legroom which was great. Back on a A320 which was terrible. Legroom was non-existent. It was as if they tried to cram in as many people as possible. Very uncomfortable for the almost 3 hour journey. I could not even read the paper there was so little room. However both flights were on time and the crew pleasant. Food going out was fine but didn't eat on the way back.
2560,KM 467 Paris - Malta 27 December 2012. Have been travelling with Air Malta over 8 years and never had any complaints. However during my last flight I was disgusted with the attitude of the air hostess who was very rude to the passengers - so unprofessional.
2561,"AI331 9 Aug BKK-BOM A321 Seat: 29f. Cabin crew greeted us in a most ""welcoming"" way with her right arm resting on the galley and the other hand resting on her hip. Mid way INTO THE cabin 1 male steward WAS standing with both arms folded atop a seat - with a blank expression. Settling into my seat I instantly notice that there is more legroom than other airlines. Then no push back for 45 minutes no reason given no information. After 50 minute we pushed back suddenly and took off without any checks that seats were upright or seatbelts. 1 hour into the flight a drink service starts and then pause 1 hour later the meal service starts. Asked if I wanted ""veg or non veg"" I had ordered voml (oriental vegan) told to wait until they had finished. 3 hrs into the flight when all have finished eating the stewardess walks past me suddenly remembers and asks ""did you like it"" and I reply ""well I haven't got it yet so I cant comment on the taste"". He runs to the galley and is back with a ""kosher meal box"". AI330 16 Aug BOM-BKK was less eventful but nothing better. I've always been a staunch TG loyal but thought this 1 time I must try my National Airline - it is the last time."
2562,LHR-DEL-LHR. Air India has improved which is not saying much. The staff are professional if not all that diligent. In business class they are pretty good if slow. The food is great but the red wine absolutely is not. Really awful. Champagne is good beer if fine. IFE is iffy but when it works they have a small selection of English films and lots of Bollywood. Seats are comfortable enough and lie flat. Amenity kits are a lottery. I suspect quartermasters are very rich at AI. Flights left on time. Overall not a terrible experience and as it is the cheapest way to travel J class to India fair value for money. A fair welcome to India.
2563,Business class from Singapore to Paris via Delhi. I've had better economy seats than these business class seats from Singapore to Delhi. Exit row seats would have been better. Plus both my wife's and my video screens didn't work both ways. Half an hour after getting boarding passes plane took off late and we missed our connecting flight to Paris. They put us in hotel and that was it. No further communication or anything. Stuck in airport (smaller than domestic) for 24 hours. More employees than passengers walking around the terminal but nothing gets done. Make a request or ask a question and they smile and every answer is yes but nothing is ever done about it. Got on plane next day and delayed 90 minutes. Missed 26 hours of Paris to look at Delhi airport that has about 10-15 shops. No alcohol in the business lounge. The new Dreamliners from Delhi to Paris are the only redeeming feature. Never again.
2564,"Flew Business Class from JFK-CDG-CAI-CDG-JFK. The Business Class seats were short in the reclining position so my 6' 2"" frame did not fit. I had to sleep in the seated position. Food was fair. I have flown Air France in the past without problems but I will hesitate in the future."
2565,"NRT-CDG-FCO and return. On the outbound I flew premium economy and the return business class. I have enjoyed Air France for several reasons the past few years on these long-hauls and this flight was no different. They are on time reliable and the food is good. Their premium economy seat and benefits suits my space requirements though as many have said the seat bottoms are very hard and there is no recline. If you're awake the entire flight no problem but don't think of sleeping. I upgraded for an extra fee on the return. The seat is much more comfortable and softer but it is not a flat bed and doesn't allow for sleep. The food was even more creative and delicious up in business but the mid-flight ""buffet"" is paltry. Flight attendants are usually very polite and efficient and I've never had a problem with language. One small complaint I experienced this trip was that they tend to cater to and make over the French nationals while being slightly perfunctory with non-French passengers. This is a mixed review but really the flights are smooth food good connection easy at CDG and I am booked on two more premium economy flights from Japan to Europe this winter. One last comment the flights and seats on long haul flights in premium economy are unique. The intra-Europe flights are always a let down in terms of seats. They are the same exact seats as economy. The only benefit being that you get a nice meal/snack and are at the front of the plane."
2566,The seats were narrow and leg room poor. A good point was the seating layout 2x4x2. The staff were polite and reasonably helpful. The inflight entertainment was poor and difficult to get to work. The worst thing was the food on the flight from Heathrow to Mauritius the food was just about acceptable. Coming back was dreadful. The dinner we left most of it and the breakfast was so dreadful that neither of us ate it. We have flown with many different Airlines none have been as bad as that.
2567,Flew from LHR-Mauritius-Perth return with my husband myself and 22 month old son. We weren't looking forward to the flights especially as our son didn't have a seat so was sitting on our laps but all 4 flights were fantastic. We were very lucky that on the 3 of the flights the plane was empty and both ground staff and cabin crew made sure we had a row of four seats so loads of room for a little one to stretch out. I thought the seats were comfortable enough far more leg more than on our flight with Qantas whilst in Australia. The cabin crew were very friendly polite and helpful. They weren't snotty about us walking our son up and down the aisle which we have experienced with other airlines Qantas being one of them. The bar seemed to be open for the entire flight which unfortunately we couldn't take advantage of being responsible parents and the food was nice. I would recommend Air Mauritius their customer service was excellent which helped travelling with a child a very unstressful and relaxing experience.
2568,LHR-MRU April 13: Tight seats and small IFE screens but overall an adequate level of service. Friendly flight crew. Food unspectacular but okay. MRU-CDG April 21: Same tight seats but bigger screens for IFE. Everything else the same as outbound flight.
2569,AMS-MLA return. Check-in in both AMS and MLA was friendly and 20 kilo allowed at no charge. A320 outbound via BRU was well maintained and cleaned on the intermediate stop. Snack bar and juice served on AMS-BRU and decent hot meal served on BRU-MLA and MLA-AMS along with drinks. Alcohol had to be paid for soft drinks etc free. Route map shown. Cabin crew - 5 of them were all rather unfriendly except Purser on way from AMS to MLA. Service on both sectors very rushed. All in all if you get a decent offer a good way to get to Malta. No audio available.
2570,My son and I flew from Vienna to Malta last summer and had an enjoyable flight. We flew in from Riga Latvia on Air Baltic and connected with Air Malta. Flights were on time and our luggage checked through as published. Good food good service clean aircraft and a friendly staff. Couldn't ask for more. I wouldn't hesitate flying Air Malta again.
2571,I've flown Air Malta quite a few times and it's gone downhill badly since my last trip with them. LHR-MLA and return. We flew in an A319 with as many seats as possible shoe-horned in. For a longer flight this would have been hugely uncomfortable and I'm by no means tall. Taller people were standing for large parts of the flight. There was a meal on both flights. The meal outbound was poor the meal on the return was inedible. The staff were as pleasant as they've always been no problems there.
2572,DEL-DXB on 12th May. There was no personal television and shared TV's were not in a good condition. The crew members were very helpful. Recommended.
2573,Traveled from Kolkata to Toronto (via Delhi and New York). As the flight was sparsely populated my wife and I had 3 seats each to ourselves and it was great. Food is pretty okay and since my wife has food allergies the staff were helpful. The journey from New York to Delhi was packed but fairly comfortable as the leg space was just adequate. Alcohol served on both the trips could have been slightly more.
2574,Took AI-191/144 AMD-EWR-AMD and was pleasantly surprised. I flew Business and found the services from ground to destination impeccable. On return leg they allowed me to board just 4 minutes before their scheduled departure as my connection from St Paul was pathetically late. Cabin crew were excellent with good and tasty food with sufficient portions. The plane was spotless and during the long 14+ hour flight toilets were routinely cleaned and toiletries properly replenished. Also the IFE worked superbly with lot of options. I would definitely recommend AI although I agree there is huge room for improvement.
2575,First time on Air India I had an excellent flight from London to Trivandrum and back. Good service in-flight and at on the ground in Heathrow Delhi and Trivandrum. I flew in AI-112 AI-46 AI-466 and AI-111 throughout my trip.
2576,I was disappointed with the business class seats. Fairly uncomfortable! I don't understand the whole concept of sticking your feet into a cubby hole under the seat in front you. There is no real leg support and as the seat doesn't lay flat you are always sliding. The armrests are also hard and elbows are sore at the end of a long flight. Even the Air France lounge at JFK was disappointing. Run down and staff not very good at cleaning. The lounge at CDG was better but still not great. Overall I would probably reserve with a different airline for my next trip as the value simply wasn't there.
2577,Paris-Johannesburg Economy. A380 upper deck. Comfortable seats excellent entertainment program and the best food in Economy I have had in years. Everything on time flight attendants were offering water several times through the flight. Real headphones not the 50 cent cheapos that sound like a tin can. Again very good breakfast. Absolutely no complaints almost perfect for economy long-distance.
2578,I flew CDG to KUL (Kuala Lumpur) on B777-200. Overall a good trip with attentive cabin service very reasonable food and good wines. IFE very good with no system problems. Although I prefer the B777 over the A380 I find the seats in the latter too confining the seat does not go fully flat and its like sleeping on a gentle hill; you tend to slip down and have to regularly push yourself back up to the pillow does not make for a good nights sleep.
2579,We recently travelled as a family of 5 from Melbourne to Paris and London Return (Perth - Mauritius - Paris London - Mauritius - Perth on Air Mauritius). We found the airline to be no frills and got us from A to B efficiently. My complaints are the economy class seats on the older Airbus A340-300s operating from London and Paris to Mauritius were worn uncomfortable and had a terrible entertainment system I struggled to sleep the whole 12 hours. The newer Airbus A330-200s operating the Mauritius to Perth route was more comfortable and had a better newer entertainment system though the particular flight we were on was packed full and quite uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight. The cabin crew did their job but did not go out of their way to offer any additional service. The food service onboard depended on which route you fly on the Parisian route we got a decent curry dinner and a refreshing French breakfast but on the Perth flight we only received a bland meal at about midnight and a horrible hot (vegetable substance) in a bread roll for arrival when all we felt like having something refreshing I noticed a large majority of people did not eat it. In the end it was an ok airline and would recommend it if you are stopping over in Mauritius.
2580,As regular visitors to Malta we have always flown with a different airline but this time we decided to fly with Air Malta mainly because this year Air Malta was a lot more competitive on price than our usual airline. We flew out of Manchester to Luqa on 6th October and returned 13th October. After the excellent service we received we have decided to be regular travellers and look forward to booking in the near future.
2581,LGW-MLA. At the risk of sounding like a record stuck in a groove this was the fourth Air Malta flight in two weeks which went very smoothly and efficiently. Check-in at Gatwick was instant and the revamped fast track facilities were as they should be. Plane left on time and arrived 15 minutes early. Service was friendly. Only gripe is that if you are sitting in row one there is nowhere to put ones bags as the overhead lockers directly above them are used by the crew necessitating stowing the bags slightly further down the plane which is a particular nuisance when disembarking.
2582,Malta - LGW. Another smooth and efficient flight only marred by a faulty seat which had a mind of its own as to when it should recline. A major plus was that Air Malta had replaced the frankfurter at breakfast to something more like a breakfast sausage. On time arrival with speedy immigration and baggage reclaim at Gatwick.
2583,LHR-MLA. The Etihad lounge at LHR Terminal 4 is a great way to start the journey and has both a buffet and a la carte breakfast. Service was slick and very professional. The flight itself was smooth with an excellent crew. Champagne was ice cold though the effect is somewhat lost when it is served to you in a tumbler. The Steward replied that Air Malta could not afford proper glasses due to its current restructuring though in the four years I have flown Air Malta this is one issue that has not yet been addressed. Food was tasty and plentiful very hot towels were offered and my traveling companion who was flying Air Malta for the very first time was impressed.
2584,The aircraft was on time from Manchester and on the return journey from Lourdes (Bartres) the aircraft left early. The staff were a bit distant the food good overall OK.
2585,TLV-TLS. Flights were on time the plane was clean inside and the seats were comfortable but there was not enough legroom. The crew were very friendly and professional. We got tasty sandwiches and drinks. Take off and landing were excellent. We will recommend.
2586,Travelled on Mumbai-Bhubaneshar Sector last week. Aircraft A319. Flight pulled back on time. Ticket Price almost on par to those offered on low cost carriers. Still received sumptuous and tasty complimentary breakfast. Only airline to not charge pre-seat selection charges. The plane was well maintained and crew efficient. Only grouse may be that IFE was not made operational on this flight.
2587,B787 Dreamliner (AI-114) on 8th Aug 2013. Timings were good (9.30pm) plane was superb less engine noise big shaded windows and comfortable seats with better leg room. The food was very good luggage was 46 kgs and I've never seen in my life a big queue for a plane check in. The crew were professional - seem to be new and very young. Smooth take off and landing. Delhi's T3 is much bigger than I thought. Transited to HYD on 9th Aug 2013 on Airbus 321 service was good and the food was very tasty. Only problem was the baggage handling. On my way back to Birmingham on AI113 served tasty food crew were helpful and as usual the new Dreamliner is excellent. Would travel again.
2588,The flight from JFK-CDG was delayed about an hour and Air France insisted that 50 minutes would be enough time to make my connecting flight to Helsinki (in a different terminal). I insisted right back that 50 minutes is nowhere near enough time at CDG knowing I would have to clear security twice ride a bus and a train and then go through passport screening and one more security check. The A380 was nothing special at all unless you were in first class. There is no economy comfort you just pay extra to sit in the exit row. The flight attendants bring drinks and food exactly twice and no more. The plane is gigantic but somehow they really squished all those seats in there. I don't normally fly this route usually I fly with KLM through Amsterdam and I am always pleased with their service. Air France continually leaves a lot to be desired in cabin service the entertainment offerings were pitiful the seats barely reclined and the service that was there was awful. The one thing they did well was fix my connecting flight with Finnair - and Finnair recognized my Platinum status on SkyTeam.
2589,CAN-CDG leg of a SYD-CDG journey. The business seat (NEV4 so the latest version so far on AF) is OK in terms of comfort especially for taller people (shorter people may be frustrated in sitting position as they cannot reach the footrest). The main drawbacks are a lack of room for conveniently putting one's own belongings and lack of privacy (especially compared to the CZ business configuration which we had on the A380 from SYD to CAN which is great in terms of private space). Catering OK although no choice for the starters (this should be improved). Good choice in terms of drinks and possibility to access a bar at all time during the flight. Possibility to have a quick dinner service (without main course) thanks to a very efficient flight attendant; that was very appreciated on a night flight as we were keen on sleeping as soon as possible (and even more appreciated considering that the dinner service with AF is usually way too long). The IFE is a little bit poor and the user interface is not very friendly (the way of listing the movies for instance should be improved - it always takes a lot of time to go through the whole lot). The flight was perfectly on time both at departure and arrival. Globally a good experience.
2590,29/10 AF 188 CDG-HKG. 6/11 AF 185 HKG-CDG. Flew from Paris to HKG and return. Seat is average on a 12-13 hours flight staff food and IFE were ok.
2591,We flew from London to Mauritius and Mauritius to Perth. We had our 16 month old daughter with us and the staff were great. Food was ok seats comfy. The land staff even gave us 4 seats for 3 of us from Mauritius for more comfort.
2592,MK748 MRU-BOM A330 with Air India code-share. One-way ticket to attend a family wedding in India after holiday in Mauritius. Air Mauritius is the only direct flight on this sector and it is code-shared with Air India. The ticket is cheaper if booked under the Air India code-share flight number than the MK one. Mauritius Airport and the Air Mauritius lounge is excellent. Very pleasant crew on the MRU-BOM sector. Economy class seats reasonably comfort. The exit row seats cost more and are available at check-in but crew very kindly assigned them to us as they were empty. Inflight entertainment is adequate with a range of movies and music albums. Meal was a full Indian service with 2 choices and all the usual accompaniments. Would recommend this airline on this sector. Only gripe is the 5am arrival in Mumbai but smooth arrival process as airport is often quiet at this time.
2593,"Not a nice experience between Perth Mauritius and Paris then return. The seats were too close to the ones in front and were some of the smallest I have ever travelled in. The video was not working and nothing could be done which made the 26 hour travel time even longer. I had asked for a ""lactose intolerant"" meal on all legs of the journey and none was forthcoming which means that I did not eat for the whole journey but still paid the same fare as others who had full meals and proper entertainment. I will never fly with these people again and suggest that others also avoid this airline."
2594,NCL-MLA on 31st July back 7 days later. I haven't flown Air Malta for several years and was worried standards would have dropped. In fact it hasn't changed much! Very slow check in at Newcastle and the hard sell from the check in staff to pre book our seats on return (we refused and saved Â£50). We had been told there were no free meals so the hot meal provided was a surprise and a bonus. Cabin crew were busy but helpful if you needed anything. It is a shame there is no in flight entertainment though. Several children were going stir crazy by the end of the flight.
2595,"Travelled to Malta from Exeter on 28 August and returned on 11 September. Delayed by over 3 hours on outward journey only explanation was ""operational difficulties"" and we were given a paltry Â£6 voucher to get a snack. Nothing else was offered not even free phone calls even though that is an entitlement. On the return journey we were gain delayed by 45 minutes because of ""late arrival if the incoming flight"". The flights were good once we actually took off but the whole experience was so tiring and stressful that we will never fly with Air Malta again."
2596,MLA-LGW. This is Air Malta as it should be - quick check-in new fast track security lane at Malta Airport and on time departure arriving early. Service on board was courteous and efficient. Only two minor whinges over breakfast. Could we have something more akin to fresh orange juice and please replace the rather bland frankfurter type sausage with something more akin to a decent breakfast sausage. Looking forward to new livery in November and hopefully the new branding will cover the interior of the plane too. Still missing points which have not been credited from my Catania flight which was reviewed here on 2nd August.
2597,Flying from Bristol to Malta on 3rd September we were removed from the flight due to Air Malta overbooking the flight. The first day of our holiday was spent in Exeter and was tedious boring and somewhat unpleasant and could hardly compare to Malta. Air Malta offered us a paltry compensation and expenses which in no way compensated for the lost of the first day of our 7 day holiday. Apparently we learnt this is common with Air Malta so watch out!
2598,Glasgow to Lourdes this journey proved all the negative reviews I had read about this airline to be spot on. Plane arrived at Glasgow four hours late after which we eventually boarded. Our troubles were just about to begin. After counting the passengers on the plane at least half a dozen times the cabin crew asked passengers sitting in the front seats to move to the back Caused great inconvenience and lost time. We arrived at our destination approx seven hours late - and five hours late going home.
2599,"Paris to Tel Aviv with group of around 35 (charter) no problems. Return a week later - big problems. Flight due to leave around 2100 delayed as plane had not yet left Paris. No explanation. After several false starts finally informed no flight until next day. Agency found us a hotel (very good). Next day after a few time changes finally left at 1930. Explanation of previous day's problem: mechanical and crew unavailability. Crew aboard our flight ""volunteered"". Good people lousy company. Too small and probably not profitable enough to meet obligations. Surely destined to close shop before long."
2600,Hyderabad-Mumbai-Jaipur early morning flight well-kept Airbus A319s on both legs. Flight well operated and on time staff attentive and efficient. Food option quite greasy for that early in the morning couldn't stomach it. IFE seemingly not activated for both legs. Apart from that a completely normal modern domestic airline experience.
2601,I have had a wonderful experience with Air India when I travelled on Delhi-Chicago. Although I was travelling Business it felt like travelling First Class. I appreciate the leg room which their seats provide. Food was very good with sufficient portions. Before travelling with AI I did heard a lot of noise about notorious Cabin crew of AI but my personal opinion is they are much better than Lufthansa United. For sure I would travel only AI now onwards.
2602,SIN-DEL-CDG then CDG-DEL-MAA-SIN in July 2013 in business class. A319 SIN-DEL was 5/10 at best - old plane and unprofessional staff. B787 Dreamliner DEL-CDG (and return) - very professional staff 10/10. DEL-MAA - A320 - OK - 6/10. MAA-SIN No boarding pass from MAA-SIN and no visa for India meant we spent 60 minutes of stress in no-man's- land while an AI staff went to get us boarding passes and clear our luggage through Chennai customs. Chennai business lounge in old terminal was shocking. Wanted to charge for drinks after the first freebie. Eventually got away to SIN on an A330 which was ok - 6.5/10. Would recommend the 787s but not much else even though I got a bargain price in business class. Dreamilners were beautiful the rest was so so.
2603,I had SkyPriority Premium Economy seating on a flight from Toronto Canada to Malaga Spain with a stop in Paris and return via the same route. The premium economy includes a few select rows with seats that have extra leg room and a deeper recline position. In-seat electric outlets for charging your electronics - they require a standard European plug. The comfort pack they handed out included socks ear plugs mask toothbrush and toothpaste and ear phone covers (headsets are built in to the seat) and TV screen either in the armrest or on seat back in front. In the bathroom there were Clarins face products and cotton pads to freshen up. Menu selection and food was very good. Alcoholic beverages are standard. After the meal we were handed a plastic container with a great selection of bon bons. Premium economy seating also meant passengers were able to board the aircraft before the regular economy passengers. Staff were pleasant and accommodating. This was such a great experience I will always choose Air France over a competitor when given the option for my flight.
2604,Manchester to St Maarten via Paris CDG. Apart from an hours delay in CDG on the outward leg all flights were on time. A340-300 for the long haul is adequate in Economy but seats are getting very hard with age and the IFE on both long haul aircraft was two or three generations out of date which is poor on a long flight. Food is barely adequate AF is no exception to a general low standard. Staff polite and efficient but only appeared at trolley service no intermediate drinks service offered available to collect from the galley only. KLM/AF have a monopoly on this route which explains why this 8 hour flight costs as much as a trip to Australia. I would try KLM next time and take my own cushion and packed lunch.
2605,We flew from Perth to Mauritius then Mauritius to KL recently. It was like flying 10-15 years ago. The seats were uncomfortable (I'm 190cm's) the food and service was ok but the service tended to fall away after the main service was completed. I think it would be ok for short flights but 8 hours with my knees around my ears was a little too much to handle. In the end we arrived on time along with our bags so we cant complain too much.
2606,We flew LHR - Mauritius in Business Class and back in Economy. Business class - nice lounge in Terminal 4 with plenty of food and drink. Boarding was separate to economy and very efficient. Seats comfortable with plenty of room and drinks offered before take off. There was option of 3 mains. The seat does not convert into fully flat bed but once I found comfortable position I managed to sleep for 8 hours. Economy class - seats have interesting shape but I found it comfortable. We were lucky that the people in front of us did not recline their seats so we had plenty of leg room. We did not watch the TV (as it was night flight delayed by 4 hours) so we just had food and slept for the rest of the flight. The crew were friendly and helpful. If I ever fly to Mauritius again I would not hesitate to fly Air Mauritius.
2607,Recently travelled JNB-MUR-JNB in economy class. I found the seats and legroom to be the most uncomfortable I have experienced on a long haul flight. Cabin crew pretty cheerful and food edible. In flight entertainment limited but given that it is a 4 hour flight not the end of the world. Would probably use another carrier on my next trip to Mauritius.
2608,The best economy deals so far. Good food and crew service. Seats are a bit cramped and uncomfortable for long haul but for short haul like Mauritius to Johannesburg and Cape Town seats are comfortable and food standard is very high. Ground crew unfriendly at Mauritius airport and passengers seemed to come second. They talk amongst themselves rather than paying attention to passengers. Long waiting and queuing time is a norm. Too many unnecessary questions. Otherwise a very well run airline.
2609,Returned 14th August from Malta to Birmingham UK with 5 hour delay with no explanation as to the problem no Air Malta representatives available to give any information until voucher given out for Light snack - a sandwich and a drink. Very poor customer care. Upon landing in Birmingham the usual comment of Thank you for travelling Air Malta and we look forward to seeing you soon was received with derision so you have lost even more passengers.
2610,Catania-Malta. Had seats in row six pre-booked for this flight which had vanished from the system by the time we got to the check-in desk. The rest of my family were seated in row 21 and myself in a middle seat in row 17. This route is the only route where this problem has occurred and may be something to do with the plane coming in from Munich with passengers on board or lack of efficiency at Catania Airport. The check-in clerk told me to speak with the crew on boarding the plane as there were spare seats in row one but these were already occupied on boarding making any further conversation fruitless. To make matters worse my pre-assigned seat (17E) was occupied by someone else who was reluctant to move despite being in the wrong seat. The saving grace was that the flight was short and punctual. Overall and on the basis of many flights taken I would still recommend Air Malta but if this was my first and only flight I would probably not.
2611,Manchester-Malta return. Very good flights cabin interior comfortable and clean. Drinks cost a lot less than the low cost airline. Cabin crew were attentive not obtrusive. I have travelled with Air Malta for twenty two years and find them to be the confident option.
2612,FRA-MAL on Airbus A319. Flight on time crew were very friendly and smiling. The food was very tasty and consisted of chicken with mashed potatoes and a delicious cake. All in all I was very impressed with Air Malta.
2613,Of the last 4 trips I spent almost as much time delayed by Air India than I did flying by Air India. Goa-Chennai delay 4 hours flight time 1.5 hours Chennai-Singapore delay time 30 mins Flight time 4 hours Singapore-Chennai delay time 5 hours flight time 4 hours Chennai Goa delay time 0 hours Flight time 1.5 hours. In all: delay time 9.5 hours Flight time 11 hours. Then I had to put up with the service.
2614,BOM-SIN. Very limited service in Business Class. Meal the same in Business as Economy. Staff mainly stayed in the front of the aircraft sitting behind a curtain. Very dated plane. Worst Business Class of any airline that I have flown on.
2615,Will never fly Air France again between LAX-CDG. I was 2.5 kg above the weight limit and the fine was 70 euro or about 90 US dollars (ridiculous). Check-in at CDG took 2.5 hours (5 lines required) and barely made it to the gate. Airbus A380 extremely uncomfortable.
2616,Washington to Paris. Boarding 30 minutes late but staff on boarding told me that flight will be in Paris on time. It was very important to me because my connection flight was only 1 hour after arrival time. After boarding plane stood more than half an hour in Washington so departure was more than 1 hour late. During the flight I tried to find out arrival time and departing gate of my next flight (also AF). Air-hostess promised me find it out and to give me an answer about 30 minutes before landing. I did not get the information and on the exit from the plane same hostess made a movement as - sorry I forgot on you. My display was not working and after two requests to the crew I did not received any answer if display can or will be repaired or at least excuse if it cannot be repaired. The drink I ordered was given to another passenger. All crew members were very happy and had good time together chatting and laughing.
2617,Dreadful service on Bangkok-Paris-London return flights. Food awful service even worse. Stewardesses snooty no drinks during flight and questions about snacks rebutted.
2618,Heathrow via Paris to Cancun return. Excellent check in and lounge at London Heathrow and transfer in Paris is fine. The lounge at CDG (being their home hub) was a little on the tired side and far too overcrowded. Onboard seats and catering good on the outbound leg. On the return the biggest difference is the seat as AF do not have lay flat seats. Overnight flight back was okay (minus the seat issue) with staff and catering excellent. Transfer back via Paris all ok and the short hop back to Heathrow was wonderful.
2619,Flown from KL to Cape Town and returned via Air Mauritius. Stopped over in Mauritius. Flown 26/12/13 and returned 1/1/2014. Although seats are cramped and very narrow the service from the air crew was excellent and food all the way was very good. We have a family of 10 and no complaints re inflight services. The only complaints we had were the ground crew at Mauritius airport being slow and a little unpleasant. Ground crew at Cape Town were good and polite.
2620,Mk745 Delhi to Mauritius. The flight was late by 1 hour. The staff were rude. It was a day flight but they served only breakfast. There was only 15 movies to watch. It was very hot onboard.
2621,DUS-MLA-DUS. Outbound leg: Online check-in not functioning long lines at check-in with only 2 check-in staff. At the gate the flight kept being delayed initially by 15 30 40 minutes and then 1 hour for a total of over 2.5 hrs. Ground staff disappeared no drinks no information. Eventually the flight was ready for boarding from an adjacent gate. The onboard experience was uneventful with charter-like service in a cramped cabin. The flight arrived at MLA 2.5 hrs late at almost 1 am. For the return leg online check-in worked well and so I went straight to the baggage-drop counter. Onboard the cabin was very cramped. The cabin crew seemed disinterested (no smiles whatsoever). For the often surly service offered by Air Malta I'd much rather fly a cheaper competitor with better legroom.
2622,FRA-MLA. Normally would use LCC. 20 minute delay in leaving held on a bus for the whole time. Cabin crew friendly with the exception of one uniforms dull and tired. Aircraft seats looked very worn considering the aircraft are relatively new. Food onboard good and free soft drinks and alcohol offered. Overall very pleasant but I can understand why people are switching to budget airlines.
2623,Malta to AMS. Flight departed on time. FA served omelette and beverage. Staffs were friendly and helpful. The cabin was very clean.
2624,Just arrived back to Heathrow from Malta. Everything went like clockwork very attentive friendly cabin crew great in flight food free newspaper. Recommend flying with Air Malta every time beats the competition.
2625,DEL-SIN-DEL. I flew through Air India 380/381. Delhi to Singapore and return. The air hostess' behaviour was not at all professional. They had smiling faces towards First class Passengers though. After that they ran out of blankets so they increased the temperature. The food was wet due to too much condensation and they forgot to mention that the entertainment system was down.
2626,DEL-IXE on A321 on 28/07. Ageing aircraft before time push back. Plane developed a technical snag in Mumbai but ground staff handled the situation professionally and we were shifted to another aircraft. Overall a satisfactory experience.
2627,Business class AF0990 Paris Johannesburg on A380. Flight was fine and service as can be expected. However the business class seats of AF must be the worst in the airline industry. Cannot believe the manager responsible for buying these chairs is still working there. They must know by now that this seat is an affront to the travelers using them. While the whole competition and even their sister company KLM goes full flat AF decided to develop a chair which sets back time a least 10 years. I am very sorry for all the French travelers that have no other choice then use this airline. I definitely will never again.
2628,Kansai International Airport to Paris. The scheduling of food and service was terrible. We took off at 12.30 and were served lunch around 14.00 (2 p.m.). Then after this service the window blinds were pulled down and the lights were dimmed (in the middle of the afternoon!). There was no further service until l5 minutes before midnight - a duration of some 9 hours! when a dinner was served. The pursers vanished (to sleep?). Someone came round with an ice- cream on a stick at some stage. Why Air France wished to turn day into night on what was a day flight that arrived in Paris at the end of the afternoon is beyond me. Why they should consider that a break in service of 9 hours is acceptable is beyond belief. What they have done of course is to use the same service timetable as that for the flight out - which made sense in that context as it was a night flight arriving early in the morning of the following day. Under those circumstances it was logical to give passengers the chance to sleep undisturbed but not for daytime flight. It just requires some basic common sense to understand that a day flight is different from an over night flight.
2629,We have just returned form a holiday in Mauritius we have been there several times but not for nine years. We have flown with other airlines as well as Air Mauritius. I cannot believe the change in what used to be such a fantastic airline. The flight was good though the staff attentive although it looked false on occasions. The biggest change was the standard of food disgusting cold and boring to say the least. Choice of fish or chicken for lunch the fish included a chicken starter chicken sandwich in the afternoon and guess what? Chicken or fish for dinner! The starter being cold crab stick and peas also peas served with the main course. We chose Air Mauritius because we had enjoyed it so much years ago and is was the only airline which offered a direct flight when we wanted to go. Will certainly shop around next year when we plan to return.
2630,Flew Kuala Lumpur-Mauritius-Kuala Lumpur in economy. After reading the negative review about MK I was quite apprehensive however I was pleasant surprised that it turned out to be one of the best flight that I undertook. The plane was nice and clean and I loved the decor. The crew were very attentive pleasant and professional. The food was delicious and adequate. The seats were not very comfortable but never is in economy of any airlines. I look forward to flying Air Mauritius again.
2631,Gatwick to Malta return Club Class. Both flights on time and inflight food and drinks service very good. Few business class passengers on both flights though. Servisair lounge at Gatwick was disappointing however La Valette Club ay Malta airport was modern with excellent selection of drinks.
2632,We were disappointed at the decline in standards. Since our last flight the standard and quantity of food has reduced. On both outward and inbound flights the main meal was chicken on the return chicken in curry sauce with dried up rice. Previously free wine and beer was available this is now a thing of the past and we were only offered soft drinks. On the outward journey the cabin crew seemed disinterested the crew on the return were more customer friendly but were speaking to each other over the voice of the captain giving messages. Cabin crew uniforms are dull and appear old fashioned. Regretfully the whole experience was disappointing and not what we expected of a schedule airline.
2633,Rome to Malta. I've flown Air Malta many times in the past but haven't for quite a while and was surprised to discover it still provided meals and drinks for such a short flight unlike most carriers. The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. The flight departed and arrived on time. There was a hitch at the airport with the departure gate changing and passengers not told - I think this may have been the fault of the airport not the airline. I have flown other airlines in and out of Malta before and have had problems but have always found Air Malta to be the most reliable.
2634,"LHR-MLA return in A320s. Air Malta still seems to provide a very ""old-school"" air service in that you still get a hot meal on short haul flights (over 3 hrs) for a reasonably competitive price. It was all very civilised. The cabin crew was pleasant professional and frequently smiled. The service comprised a meal then drinks round about 40 mins into the flight (alcoholic beverages and certain soft drinks are charged for) followed by a tea/coffee round. If you wanted any more drinks later you could ask the flight attendants who were visible throughout the flights. The niggles for this trip were not being able to check in online for flights from Heathrow whereas you could do so for most other origins and their 20 kg checked baggage allowance when most comparable airlines allow 23 kg. Nevertheless I would definitely use them again."
2635,MXP-FRA-DEL-HYD. Flight was very good and connection was very smooth in Frankfurt crew were reasonable food was average and seat spacing was very good. Aircraft was Dreamliner transit at Delhi was very good domestic sector of the flight was especially good crew very friendly and food very good. They should improve their overseas crew and food otherwise a perfect journey.
2636,LHR-ATQ with stop over in Delhi both ways. 9.30pm departure from London but ended up taking off at 11.40pm due to late arrival of aircraft. Full flight. Boarding was quick. Good point is that the leg room is the best I have experienced compared to other airlines I have flown in economy. Wasn't asked what meal I'd like just given veg option. But it was nice. In fact food was great on all flights. A drink and peanuts on the domestic sector. Cabin crew were ok just done what they had to but call bells are NOT answered. I tried on 5 occasions. Inflight entertainment was average. Great if you like Bollywood movies. But some passengers screens weren't working. The transit in Delhi is a mess lack of organisation and going through security is chaotic not to mention the rudeness of the airport staff (not Air India's fault). I wouldn't hesitate to fly Air India again if the price was cheapest again. Jet Airways service is a lot better.
2637,Paris to Boston in business class. The plane and seats were great except one toilet was not working and closed. The main issue was lack of clear English announcements. Even though the flight was coming to Boston but there was nothing in clear English. This made the situation for us painful. We were served with some appetizers mainly duck. I did not like it and the hostess made a comment in broken English as if I was not hungry. When the main meal was served she did not include me as if I did not need anything to eat in a long flight. My wife sitting next to me was served that main meal while I was talking to her. Before landing they served something that I can only describe as least desirable. It had a tiniest of half a sandwich without any meat or egg. A big cup of heavy marinated fruits. In short after a long flight in AF Business we had to stop at a McDonald before driving home.
2638,CDG-JNB-CDG on A380. One of the best parts was the first lounge in CDG. Welcome is perfect the lounge is not so big but modern and beautiful. The dinner in the lounge was excellent with fine wines. Transfer by limo for Boarding was perfect. Nice welcome by the crew - all the other seats in first were empty! I did not try the onboard dinner. IFE is good but need to be improved compared to other airlines the screen is small. Full flat bed was very comfortable before landing at JNB breakfast was ok. On the return flight to Paris I stayed at the business lounge before boarding there is no first class lounge in JNB. Nice welcome by crew again all the other seats in first were empty. Served a very good champagne before take off. I was disappointed by the catering in first class from JNB wines were very good but food is far from standards in first class. I think that the IFE and the food must be improved on flights especially the return flight to Paris. Another problem is the lack of privacy in fist class fortunately I was alone on these flights.
2639,Flew CDG-JFK on A380. Heard many negative about AF from airport experience to poor flight crews and service well I think that is a thing of the past now. My experience from check-in immigration and security the lounges the flight itself was great. Everyone very friendly and helpful. The business class seats were comfortable the food was wonderful cabin crews did everything they could to make you feel welcomed and taken care of. As far as navigating the dreaded CDG I found the signage easy to follow as we made our way from the Ibis via train shuttle to terminal 2F and on to 2E for check-in.
2640,Flew on 29th 0ctober once again from CDG to JNB. Beside that by now we all know what a great design this A380 is and how much more peaceful it is inside this airplane when flying. The reason for my comment this time is the very noticeable improvement by AF crew and AF catering to put in an effort to take better care of passengers. AF crew are usually always very polite they seem to enjoy their jobs again. Catering has improved again and food quality is very close to what I remembered it was so many years ago and one of the reasons I became a regular customer of AF. Also noticeable is the new design of cutlery even if made from plastic using them makes it much easier to enjoy the food. Well done AF now just improve the snacks served between meals on this route and it will be perfect.
2641,You buy from Mauritius a business ticket at truly business class price and you get an old coach seat on a 4 hours flight in my case Nairobi to Mauritius. Okay they will leave the middle seat empty but you will be extremely cramped in your seat with no possibility to recline it and no space for your legs. To say the least this is a rip-off unexpected from the flag carrier of a country known for the quality of its hospitality. To be fair the meal served was pretty decent and the wines palatable. As for the in-flight entertainment it was at the level of an African regional carrier.
2642,Business Class from Cape Town to Mauritius to London then back to Mauritius and on to Cape Town a week later. The short haul trips CT to Mauritius were a complete waste of money. As far as I can see there is no real benefit to paying for business class. The seats are a three-row of which they only use two so a bit of extra space but not much extra comfort and the food etc was identical (according to a friend who was in economy). The long haul was better but even then the seats are the most uncomfortable business class seats I have ever experienced. The strange pitch means you are always sliding down and there is some kind of hard ridge right in the middle. Horrible. The airport experience was good the flight attendants were nice and the food on the long haul was good but - even for the cheapest Bizclass seat out there - never again except on the short run from SA to Mauritius.
2643,Had booked for the wife and I to go to Luxor for the day booked in advance through Thomson holidays. I thought it would be Egyptair but getting onboard found out it was an Air Memphis MD-83. On entering the plane you could see how old it was old seats equipment etc. It stank of aviation fuel at the back which is where we were sitting. It was only a 30 minute flight to Luxor but I was so glad that is all it was. It was ok and they gave out little cartons of juice to take up the time.
2644,We booked a day trip to Luxor from Sharm and flew Air Memphis. Aircraft was an old MD83 which was tired looking inside and out but clean. Friendly cabin crew juice and a snack were served. Don't let appearances put you off.
2645,Malta-Gatwick Club Class. On arrival at the airport prior to the return to the UK we saw an offer regarding Club Class upgrades for ??9 each on selected flights. We were delighted to discover this would be available on our particular flight KM0118 as it was in fact our wedding anniversary that day. We paid at the information desk and obtained the necessary receipts which we exchanged for Club Class boarding passes. Once on board the service did not appear as attentive as previously experienced and it became apparent when the food was served. When we queried why we had been given an Economy meal on a the mini tray whilst those around us had an overflowing tray of starters mains desserts plus cheese and biscuits etc. The Steward immediately produced the passenger manifest which described us as ?˜involuntary upgrades?? As far as he was concerned we had obtained the upgrade for free and that there were only enough Club Class meals for the ?˜paying customers??so tough luck. The conversation with the Steward was very embarrassing and distressing for us in front of the other 4 passengers in the Club Class cabin who were acutely aware of what was going on.
2646,Since my sister moved to live in Malta over 14 yrs ago my family and I have enjoyed twice yearly trips to Malta from Birmingham Airport. Having always flown with Air Malta all this time and enjoyed the experience apart from the odd delay on departure I was shocked to find out that Air Malta no longer fly from or to Birmingham Airport. Why is this? Now we have to make alternative arrangements to travel elsewhere (other destinations other than Malta) as we were spoilt by Air Malta and their professionalism care and attention to their passengers young and old.
2647,Heathrow-Malta on time staff friendly and relaxed. Hot meal (nothing spectacular but we didn't expect much at this price) hot and cold drinks. Online check in available flying back from Malta but not flying from Heathrow. Can cost a little more than airlines such as Ryanair - but worth it.
2648,Heathrow-Malta return on A320. Friendly and welcoming crew. Awful legroom and space but a complimentary hot meal served with cold drinks and later tea and coffee. Inflight entertainment for the 3hr flight consisted of a wildlife documentary. Overall experience was good but let down by handling agents at Heathrow who took 1 hour and 30 minutes after we had landed to deliver the bags.
2649,Regular user last flights were DEL-BOM-CJB and MAA-IXZ. A320s were showing signs of ageing and the ground crew botched up seat allotment. DEL-BOM-CJB was delayed by an hour at BOM due to congestion (more of the airport's fault than the airline's). Both flights however were smooth and comfortable with decent service and great food. IFE was adequate for a two hour flight though it could do with a better selection. They also have an above- average inflight magazine that's worth a flick through. Experienced pilots made flying through bad monsoon weather fairly unnoticeable while the air hostesses though ageing were very courteous and polite. Compared to private airlines the ones on Air India speak fluent English! Would always stick to AI.
2650,I am a regular traveler between DXB-MAA-DXB (AI 905/ AI 906). Flight was good. Average age of aircraft Airbus A321 is around 3-4 years. Seats are comfortable food is good. There is improvement on punctuality. Turnaround time at DXB is far better and quick. Inflight service is good and crew are efficient.
2651,Flew DEL-MAA Air India's brand new 787 Dreamliner on June 22. Departed on time arrived good 20 min early. Excellent AVOD for a domestic flight. Good food active young crew clean plan smooth flight. Enjoyed the new large electronic window shades sky interiors. Seats were comfortable with foot rest and USB port for charging. Will fly them again.
2652,On Sunday 11/03/2013 they canceled a whole flight from Bologna to Paris France without telling the passengers. My wife on her route back to US from Italy was supposed to be on that flight and they gave her an alternate flight with KLM 12 hours longer and later. The timing was so bad that thanks to the delay of KLM she missed her last part of the flight from Atlanta to Salt Lake City. After 40 hours on the way 24 hours of delay and missing several academic and business meting she arrived on Monday. I never trust Air France ever again.
2653,I flew the A380 from CDG to Washington DC on Monday 21 October and it was a great experience. I had booked a business award flight in seat 66A upper deck and I have no complaints about the quality of the seat the tidiness of the cabin or the high quality of the food served. The crew were nice and professional and I have nothing to complain about. It was a great experience from checking to landing. The food was very good and even though I could not get my first choice the second choice was very tasty (duck with chestnuts and mash).
2654,Travelled from Melbourne to Paris 11th Sep code share Cathay Pacific. While the seats on Air France were not as comfortable as Cathay the service was considerably better. The women who looked after us were fabulous. Friendly polite and happy! This fare was much cheaper than other business class flights but the flight did not reflect this. We were very surprised with our flight considering the reviews were not great. We will certainly consider Air France again.
2655,Heathrow to Mauritius return. Not sure what all the negative comments are about - personally I had a lovely flight with Air Mauritius. Crew were friendly food was fine and seat was fine too. As for entertainment - I'm not too bothered but there seemed to be an ok selection of movies and music etc.! Overall if you're flying economy a plane is a plane and a seat is a seat so take AM and have a nice trip to Mauritius.
2656,India to Mauritius. Frustrated when I saw the touch screen was not working properly. I pressed the call button to call an FA who came to my seat after 15 mins. Water requested was provided after half an hour. I was unable to see flight attendants as they were sitting chatting with each other. Never again.
2657,Atrocious service on Air Mauritius and no follow up on complaint. Having pre-booked 2 aisle seats we found ourselves seated behind an incessantly screaming infant. Since the flight wasn't full we asked to be moved. The young father of the child overheard our request took offence and became aggressive. We called the purser but before we could say anything the father accused us of threatening his wife and children. The purser believed him. We are a well travelled couple in our 50s and have never experienced anything like this. We were moved - but we were shunted to rear of the plane and put in a middle and window seat - despite there being several rows of empty seats (which we were told were broken). I'd further add that flying on an AM plane is like traveling in a compressed sardine can - there is utterly no leg room.
2658,Belgrade to Hurghada on a charter flight. Old plane non-existent leg space cold food and dated biscuits. Only good thing I can say about them is that the cabin crew were nice.
2659,We've made a return flight Paris - Marsa Alam on an A320. I have to say that crew were all very kind playing with children smiling. It's quite rare to see warm food in a charter flight even though the food was forgettable. Seats seem to be refurbished. Mine during the first flight was broken and I was always on recline position even during take-off. Return flight an A320 with no sign on the tail the space for legs was a shame.
2660,Heathrow to Malta and back to Gatwick economy class. Flight just under an hour late leaving Heathrow due to the French air traffic strike but on time leaving Malta on return. Free Maltese newspapers given out on boarding and hot meal served which was basic but edible. Free soft drinks and alcoholic ones charged at Â£2.50. Inflight programmes shown on overhead screens but no headphones give out. Overall quite basic and could be improved considerably with little extras but still better then many other full service carriers.
2661,Manchester to Malta return and encountered no problems. A320 on both flights with pleasant professional cabin crew. Both flights on time. Meals were basic but adequate for such a short flight.
2662,Paris (CDG) Malta return. The inbound flight was delayed for 90 minsh without any explanation and boarding was a mess. Both flights on clean aircraft with enough legroom for the duration of the flight. Inflight tv but no headphones . Food edible except for the bread and ok flight attendants. Altogether an okay airline but nothing to write home about.
2663,Third time I have travelled London to Malta with my family. Flight was excellent food fine and staff very helpful.
2664,Delhi-Chennai via Mumbai. I was not expecting much customer service flight service (timings) but it was the opposite. Very nice in-flight service by cabin crew quick response to passengers and the quality of food was excellent too. Arrived early to our destination.
2665,DEL-IXE on Airbus 321. Pushed back ahead of time early arrival as well. Breakfast adequate. Good all round and would recommended.
2666,We recently flew from San Antonio TX to Paris France with final stop in Barcelona. The dates were October 9th and October 21st. I was extremely pleased with the service crew and food that was offered. The service far exceeded any other flights I have taken in the last five years! The crew actually looked like they enjoyed their jobs and were very accommodating.
2667,AF275 Tokyo-Paris CDG. Rather small and non inviting lounge at Narita very limited choice of food and drinks (comparing to Delta's Crown Room next door). Flight delayed for 4 hrs due to tech problem but all passengers were kept informed some snacks and drinks were served on board while waiting. After take off decent lunch was served food very nice but surprisingly wines choices were limited and not very good. Seat ok IFE as well snacks soups ice cream were served between the meals dinner before arrival was very tasty decent portions and choice. Excellent cabin crew definitely big plus. I missed my connecting flight had to stay overnight in Paris hotel and two meals were booked by AF next morning travelled home. Good service despite delay. Recommended.
2668,Travelled Paris to Johannesburg on the evening A380 flight on 27 September. The economy cabin at the rear is surprisingly cosy for such a large plane and noticeably quieter than any other wide-bodied plane. The dinner and breakfast were both excellent; choice of entertainment very good; and service both professional and friendly. Would be happy to recommend Air France.
2669,We fly fairly regularly to Mauritius. Having used BA not bad although timings now not great and also Emirates great planes disastrous customer service when a problem occurs. So despite my slight reservations we flew with Air Mauritius. Very pleased we did. The staff were friendly helpful and couldn't have been nicer both on the way out and on the return. Food ok usual airline food. Seats although not fully flat bed very comfortable and every bit as comfortable as BA. Flight timings in and out of London superb. A non stop flight out of Heathrow. We will use them again.
2670,"Air Mauritius the cheapest way of getting to Mauritius. PER to SSR must have been the first A330 built seats coming apart - big black box under seat which after reading Skytrax is the ""entertainment"" box - it did not have much in it - only one movie that was worth watching. The staff appeared so uninterested - I would suggest Air Mauritius employ some staff from a country where people want to work. On return I noted that Air Mauritius did have some staff apparently not Mauritian perhaps in an attempt to lift the service standard. Two cups of tea only in a long flight one with UHT milk and one with that chemical called ""Creamer"" so I had coffee instead of tea to hide the revolting taste. Return flight about 90% full. I really noticed the difference when I got back onto Qantas at Perth for the Sydney run. Qantas offer some entertainment - a better range of movies the sound was good had a selection of Australian music - Seekers John Williamson etc. Comparing Air Mauritius to Qantas - like chalk and cheese. Have relatives that will be making two trips back to Australia this year - first will be by Air Mauritius as they are paying the second most likely by Emirates as the company is paying. I can put up with a old plane but there is no excuse for Air Mauritius poor entertainment or slack in flight service."
2671,Perth to Johannesburg (4 legs PER-MRU MRU-JNB return). PER-MRU was excellent 7 hours on an Airbus A340 with the proper large BC seats service and food quality. As it's an overnight stay in Port Louis the airline arranges transfers and accommodation. Both were prompt and very comfortable. MRU-JNB was awful. 4 hours on an old Airbus A319. Business Class was just economy seats 3 wide with the middle seat covered by laydown tray. There was no in-flight entertainment the food was just OK and the service (by 2 attendants) was ordinary to say the least. The reverse legs were on the same type of aircraft an Airbus A330. We were 1.5 hours late leaving Port Louis with no explanations to why. The seats were older style of B/Class. The service was good and the food plentiful but you can easily tell that it's airline food.
2672,Luxor via Sharm to Manchester on A320 after Monarch refused to let me and my 8 year old daughter board with Kiss Flights tickets. There were 13 of us stranded at Luxor and about 70 more in Sharm so we only half filled the plane. The crew was friendly professional and sympathetic to the fact we had been delayed for a further 4 hours. Whilst the plane was obviously quite new the seats were refurb in my opinion but we had plenty of leg room a very pleasant but simple dinner - no alcohol on board - but drinks free with our meal unlike Monarch who only give coffee free. As soon as we had eaten and duty free had been up and down the lights were dimmed as it was very late. Air Memphis may be budget domestic flights but their international flight for me and my companions on board I thinks was excellent.
2673,My son and I flew Air Memphis from Hurghada to Cairo (and the return flight) in August 2010. Like most people I had expected an Egyptair plane and was surprised to see Air Memphis as I had never heard of them. I too noticed a pool of some liquid under the plane as we went up the steps to board but gave it little more thought. The flight up to Cairo was on a relatively new Airbus but it had the same problems of broken seats overhead lockers etc. The person sitting next to me was on her own and obviously a nervous flier at the best of times and she had kittens when the locker above her flew open mid flight! Other than that the flight was uneventful we were offered but politely refused the date biscuits and carton of drink as they looked like they had been offered round many times previously. The flight back was on an ageing MD83 I have never liked flying on planes where the engines are mounted at the back either side of the tail.
2674,I flew Air Memphis Luxor to Abu Simbel on a very ancient Romanian built BAC 111. Frightening on way out even worse when we landed back at Luxor - we were still deplaning onto a ferry bus when the pilot and engineer used a car jack to replace one of the front wheels that had a very bald tyre in front of all passengers. Never again.
2675,Catania - Malta. Queuing at Catania a complete mess and took approx 45 minutes. Once on board allocated seats in row two were filled by two pasengers travelling through from Frankfurt. Had to wait with whole family including two tired seven year old daughters until all passengers boarded and then load supervisor arrived to sort things out for us. Purser was very apologetic but unable to do anything until load supervisor could sort things out. Flight otherwise uneventful until the hardest of landings I have experienced in 40 odd years of flying. No apology or comment from flightdeck or cabin crew on this which was a little disconcerting.
2676,Flew Air Malta to Rome. Outward flight was cancelled by Air Malta with the reason that there was an airport strike in Rome Fiumicino. Interestingly enough there was another flight to Rome Fiumicino with another airline departing an hour later that left as scheduled without any delays etc. Air Malta offered re-routing on another of their flights departing 8 hours later but did not give us any vouchers for meals or snacks or rerouting on an earlier flight with another airline as stipulated by EU law. According to them it was not their fault that the flight was cancelled and therefore we were not entitled to anything. Check-in staff helpful both in Malta and Rome Staff at ticketing desk and cabin crew could not care less about our situation or about the passengers in general. The flights were rather uneventful. Meals can be hardly called dinner or lunch as they consisted of half a sandwich and a small water container (100ml). On the way back we had stopover in Reggio Calabria airport which took about an hour during which about 20 passengers got off and on the aircraft. Would not recommend Air Malta for this route as it is currently being served by much more competitive airlines offering direct routes.
2677,I also contacted Air Malta regarding the Volcanic Ash Problem. Sent them a letter by recorded delivery and have not received any acknowledgement. Have also e-mailed them several times in addition to sending them requests via their feedback form on their website. Have not received any response at all! I do intend to pursue this but will never fly with them again if this is how they treat customers.
2678,I have contacted Air Malta re stuck in Malta during Volcanic Ash problem. I wrote to Air Malta five weeks ago and have not even been sent an acknowledgement. I have e-mailed and have been ignored. This is not what I would call customer service.
2679,Chicago-Delhi-Bangalore. Aircraft from ORD-DEL was a Boeing 777-300 majestic look from outside but once you get in the flight you get to see a few unpolished areas seats are ok not great. Decent leg room. Cabin crew don't smile much and have to be called a thousand times to attend your request. Choice of inflight entertainment was limited with a lot of ancient Hindi movies and English movies. Food was good. The ticket price was sky high because I booked it 3 days in advance but the service I got was below mediocre. Once you arrive in Delhi having to collect my checked in bags and to check in again is a complete hassle.
2680,LHR-BOM-LHR. Check in at T3 was a little busy but it did not take too long to get airside. The lounge was OK although lacking a little atmosphere. Boarding was quite funny. When they announced that passengers with children plus first and business class passengers could start boarding about 300 people all got up and jammed the departure point! On board the crew were very efficient helpful and friendly. Very spacious seats although slightly uncomfortable when they are fully reclined. The quality of the food was excellent although the presentation could be improved a little. Although I did not pay for the ticket I was told it was well over half of the cost of travelling with BA and as such represents excellent value. Would definitely travel with Air India again.
2681,Delhi to Singapore and Singapore to Chennai. I am an Air India loyalist but I mostly fly them within India wherein I find their service quite good. There is a marked difference while flying them International. They use an A319 on their DEL-SIN route which is generally packed to capacity. Luckily I got upgraded however their business class seat is very poor. The recline is as much as that of their economy class seat and most foot rests were broken. There were PTVs but nothing was playing not even a flight plan. There was a snack served at take off (midnight departure hence I refused) which was the end of any service for the rest of the flight. A cup of tea had to be asked for before arrival at Changi. SIN-MAA on a tired A330-200. Flight absolutely packed. Service was quick and efficient with dinner served however I was very surprised that their bar only had beer or whiskey not even wine. Over head TVs showing a Bollywood movie with subtitles but terrible picture quality like they were running a pirated movie. Fares are cheap and you do get what you pay for. I don't them to fly close by but I pay a premium and fly a gulf or SE Asian carrier for long haul.
2682,"From ORY to MRS on March 17th 2013 (AF 6047). The same day the other way from MRS to ORY (AF6006). Same round- trip on August 2nd 2013. ORY-MRS AF 6049. MRS-ORY AF 6006. I've been flying Air France for more than 11 years. Despite some delays due to ATC strikes or technical reasons (mid-exit doors unable to operate on A320 once 3hrs of delays offset by a 4k Miles Prime compensation) this airline fulfills my expectations. I don't fly a lot but I've done almost 50 flights over the years so my comment is based on a true experience. The crews are friendly experienced professional committed to making sure you're alright anytime while onboard. You'll always be welcomed as it should be. However things changed since I first flew them. The seats in short/mid haul flights are now lighter which means you can't stretch out anymore really bad point. Food isn't that bad but always on this flight's type this is a snack more than a meal. Entertainment just doesn't exist on short/mid haul flights neither outlets for your computer. That's why I think prices are sometimes quite high regarding the same flight on another day. Moreover at the 2nd main Paris airport there are a lot of delays mainly caused by the staff of the airport so when you fly from Paris choose the first hub ""CDG"" far from the city compared to ORY (Orly) but way more efficient. To summarize a bit this is French way of life great customer care recent nice and clean airplanes (inside and outside) mainly European made. Just give them a chance make it your favourite airline and you won't be disappointed."
2683,As long as you fly Business Class you are good but the Economy Class has very hard seats and after 11 hours your back will hurt. This is probably the same for other airlines. I usually fly from LAX to GOA (Italy) via CDG from two to four times a year. I really wish there were better alternatives but it so happens that Air France has the shortest flights. Once after booking online on their website my trip I realized I made a mistake and although it says that all flights can be cancelled within 24 hours it took a lot of effort to get my money back. They seem to nickel and dime you for every little thing. More than once the flight from LAX was late and my connection was lost. I had to spend the night in Paris at a very cheap motel with bad food and uncomfortable beds. If you have the extra money to avoid Air France cheap accommodation you'll be fine. Food and staff are usually ok but when you try to contact the customer service for a refund good luck you'll need it. Of course if you want to purchase a new ticket they are very available and will help you immediately.
2684,Return flight MUC to JFK via Paris was a very satisfying experience. Everything went smooth not the slightest delays and I was impressed on how friendly and considerate the service was on the long-haul flight. The transit at CDG was extremely easy in the Air France Terminal 2. Best part was the flight on the A380 on the way back because the entertainment system was superb finally a working touch screen and good head phones. The trip to New York was operated by Delta also no complaints.
2685,Fly Air Mauritius once a year and the service keeps going down. Leg room is very poor seat material is old and dirty entertainment equipment is old. On our last flight my wife pressed the service button after 10 mins no one came. She had to go to the back of the plane where all the attendants were too busy having a chat to ask for a bottle of water.
2686,PER-MRU-PER August 2012 - A330-200. Plane is fairly new on PER-MRU legs. Travelling with toddler (under 2) and 2 adults. Economy pretty standard config and seats small but relatively comfortable. Outbound at PER not allowed to use QF lounge even though I was QP. Plane quite empty. Had to wait for 1.5 hrs for Virgin arrival from Melbourne which had 40+pax on. Even with them the flight was about 70% loading. Gave us a row of 4 to us so we were able to lay the child down for a nap. Outbound was daytime flight and quite easy - IFE very basic. Food was ok (poor entree). Not a lot of drinks (hot cabin too) and service was too quick with them wanting to get everything out the way ASAP. Toddler given an infant meal (as she was on an infant ticket) and we were not allowed to get anything else as there was no other food loaded. Return - slightly more full but this time we were given a bulkhead. Pointless with a toddler but we did have a row of 4. Word of warning the bulkhead rows the arm rests do not lift up. Overnight flight but bulkhead was near toilet which was going all night - so impossible to get sleep. Also some annoying little blue light sits right above you so its not dark either. On SSR/MRU Airport second comments from Philip Loveder below. Airport cant cope with 3 x 747 and A330 leaving at the same time. Place was packed. No chairs nowhere to sit even on the floor. If you are on your own fine but with kids its hard work! Poor timing of scheduling of the flights left a bad feeling to what was an amazing holiday.
2687,Very similar to previous comments! We did the Sharm to Cairo day trip. Sharm to Cairo was OK (almost normal but a very old/cramped plane). But the return to Sharm in the evening was the first time I've ever really thought we were going to crash-lan. The plane was in a very steep final descent and turning left then right then left - right up until we hit (and bounced off again) the runway - and the cockpit door was wide open much of the flight. I would not recommend Air Memphis to anyone. (Boarding passes with random names on crazy/disorganised boarding process etc all applied to our return flight too!)
2688,Aswan-Abu Simbel return as part of a pre-booked excursion. Had I known it was this airline I might have thought twice. Flew on a DC9 - I am 45 and sure this aircraft was older than me. It should be in a museum. Most of our tour party were quite relieved to make it back to Aswan - and that is about the most I could say about this flight - we made it back. Surprisingly staff quite good for a 30 minute flight each way. Not for the faint hearted.
2689,London-Malta. I wrote a review in June last year on Air Malta which included my comments that we had booked Club Class but the cabin crew were on strike and so there were limitations on what we were served during the flight. I wrote to Air Malta and they gave us a free upgrade on another flight to Malta which we accepted and we have just returned from a short break there. We were allocated seats 3D & 3F on both flights and these were perfectly acceptable. There is no middle seat in Club Class which gives extra space for books papers and other flight paraphernalia. Service was excellent food was of a decent quality and the drinks offered were very acceptable. Our bags were priority tagged at both airports and arrived quickly in Malta not so quickly at Heathrow. We were also given access to the Executive Lounge at LHR via the Club Class tickets but not at Luqa airport fortunately we have Priority Pass membership so gained access using our cards. I would use Air Malta again and feel they deserve credit for offering us an upgrade without it being a long drawn out negotiation.
2690,Malta-Manchester-Malta. Ok flight out but hot main course proved a mystery to many passengers. It looked like lasagne but was supposed to be a cottage pie though did not taste like one. Why does Air Malta continue to offer in flight films/documentaries yet does not offer passengers headsets or even announce that you can use your own. On the return flight food was better but crew offered the bare minimum of service - no smiles read the newspapers for much for the flight and even curtained off row one so they could use it as a rest/reading area. Air Malta always provides a reliable product but its service lacks flair and imagination in the main.
2691,Malta-Munich Business class Hamburg - Malta Economy class. Brilliant business class service with fantastic cheery service from the purser. Champagne offered mid flight too without having to ask for it. Code share on to Hamburg with Lufthansa worked a treat with aircraft parked next door. Return flight from Hamburg Ok but on less spacious aircraft with more tightly packed seating than most other Air Malta planes. Food very average and row one occupied by Air Malta crew.
2692,Not bad however not good either. Airline doesn't provide blankets or headphones and the In flight entertainment is non-existent. The food is not bad at breakfast or dinner. However the A320 lacks from space and you can't use a laptop (even if small) due to the lack of space. The crew is professional however not friendly at all. Don't expect smiles during the inflight service.
2693,Clean comfortable aircraft with reasonable leg room in economy. Food extremely mediocre but what do you expect on an economy budget. Reasonably pleasant cabin crew. Flights on time.
2694,AI 863 on IXC-DEL-BOM. Airbus 321 with decent leg space but poorly maintained. Two overhead bins had been taped shut one of our video screens did not work and the seat reclining mechanism did not work on some seats. Flight was on time but average food and standard non-smiling crew does not make it exactly a pleasant experience.
2695,Return trip to Hyderabad India from London Heathrow. Overall I was extremely satisfied with Air India. They improved service a lot. May 17th 12.30pm from London Heathrow to Delhi and connecting to Hyderabad reaching 18th May 2013 at 9am. Flight was a bit old. Interiors were dull but the leg space was really good and better than many other airlines. Food was fantastic and the entertainment was excellent as well. Flight started on time and reached Delhi on time. Domestic from Delhi to Hyderabad was OK. Return trip on 24th May 2013 at 9.30 am from Hyderabad to Delhi and to LHR. Domestic was OK. Flight from Delhi to LHR was excellent. New Boeing 777. Food average and reached London 1 hour early.
2696,AI 864 from BOM-IXC via DEL. A321 with decent leg space slightly lacking in maintenance (one panel in a toilet would not latch) personal video screens but a choice of only 5 channels standard breakfast fare. ground staff and cabin crew efficient but absolutely no smiles. lovely touchdown at DEL but shaky approach to IXC.
2697,Flew LAX to Paris and on to Athens and back the same route 2 weeks later A380 economy. Full flight 500 on board. If you have tight connections in Paris and are at the back do not book those connect times the airport terminal changes are what seems like miles to walk and then long lines at immigration but once on the plane if you make it the service is the best I have had. The crew wonderful to your needs and the food great and too much to eat really. The snacks between meals and the free wine and beer the best. First rate movies and free head sets to keep you occupied was nice. There is ice cream whenever you desire it. The only downside is that I fly Delta usually domestically and they advertise that AF is their partner but what rules go for Delta usually do not apply to AF especially their pet policy internationally - beware otherwise the A380 is awesome.
2698,"When my sister and myself were informed about a flight delay I went to the boarding counter and asked staff if it would affect my connecting flight from Paris to Singapore. I was informed that we would not miss our connecting flight and someone at Paris would escort us to the connecting flight. However when we reached Paris we were left to ""scramble"" with some other passengers to find our way to the boarding gate for the connecting flight. When we reached the boarding gate we were informed that we had missed the flight (AF256). The staff we approached for help rudely directed us to the customer service counter. When we asked to be put on the same flight we were informed flatly that ""all the flights are full and they could only get us flights separately"". After much insistence she ""miraculously"" found us a flight which we could take on together! We were given free accommodation sharing the same room. We are frequent travellers and it was our first time taking Air France and what a memorable experience!"
2699,I want to commend the cabin staff on Flight AF006 from CDG to New York JFK on Wednesday October 23 2013 for their help and professionalism. My husband is disabled and cannot walk. He needed to go to be bathroom and a steward helped me get him to the lavatory. He has MS and I needed to clean and change him. When we left the bathroom he could not walk at all and two Air France stewards carried him to his seat. I had unfortunately stuffed up the sink and they closed the bathroom without saying a word. They were so understanding.
2700,Flight MK 034 from MRU to CDG on 12-12-08. The most uncomfortable trip in business-class we have had. The seats are not only no lie-flat when you try to find a position to sleep it is not possible as you always slip downwards. The cabin-crew were unfriendly and unenthusiastic. The quality of the food was poor.
2701,Flew SIN-MRU-KUL-SIN. Have flown several times before and I have received the same consistent good service every time. Check in was uneventful and normal. Boarding was quic the crew were smiling and friendly. The interior of the A330-200 is fresh and new. The seat though wasn't something to smile about. It was pretty cramped and I couldn't sleep a wink throughout the night flight. IFE was good decent selection of films and games. Food was also good really enjoyed it however there was no cabin presence throughout the night flight. Overall it was quite a good flight and I would recommend Air Mauritius.
2702,Pleasantly surprised by the service. I found the seats were just too small and quite hard but overall you get what you pay for. Fair value for money attentive staff clean seats and a smooth flight.
2703,Sharm to Cairo plane looked tired scruffy seats dirty windows and cramped interior. However the flight to Cairo was pleasAnt with a good view of the pyramids and a good landing. After a wonderful day in Cairo we arrived back at the airport for our return flight and things now began to get interesting. After passing through security we were instructed to join a queue at check in where we were joined by a cat who ignored everybody and went to the front. As we waited an officIal walked down the queue and took our boarding passes to the check in desk on arriving at the desk ( we were last ) we were informed that only three seats remained but there were four passengers. After a few moments of anxious conversation it became clear we were in the queue for a flight to Luxor. Mistake reCtified we received our tickets for our flight to Sharm and discovered that our names were now Anton and Anna.The cat was by this time stretched out on the luggage conveyer belt. After waiting one and half hours we boarded our flight back to Sharm through the rear entrance of the plane with the engines running at what appeared to be more then idle speed. Cairo is a large airport at the taxi journey to the runway can be a protracted business (20mins) this was when a few doubts began to surface sudden large increases of thrust that some passengers thought we were about to take off. When the aircraft braked you could hear the brakes grinding take off was good and the fifty minute flight was fine until final approach to Sharm and changes in engine speeds that suggested there may have been a problem. However we landed safely and after taxing to stand I did think that the ground staff were a little tentative about approaching the aircraft throughout both journeys the crew were polite and professional same crew both ways.
2704,"My wife and I flew Sharm to Luxor on the DC9 -as the other comments say seats where broken the same crew that we had in the early morning still controlled the plane on the return flight late that night. I'm sure we all recall the somewhat vertically challenged stewardess handing out the date biscuits and fruit drinks. As we entered though the tail my wife pointed to the ""gaffer tape"" holding things together I noticed a large puddle of fluid under the body I convinced myself it was just water! However we got there and back on landing there was a deserved round of applause."
2705,We booked the Aswan-Abu Simbel excursion thinking we'd fly on an Egyptair aircraft but what we found at Aswan airport was an old DC9 of this previously unknown company called Air Memphis. The flight was ok but I wouldn't recommend the same experience to anybody. The airplane was old and smelly seats were broken no safety demonstration and fantasy names on our boarding cards. I'm an experienced flier but this was one of the worst experiences in my life don't do the same mistake and if you want to visit Abu Simbel (which is beautiful by the way) book an Egyptair flight or just forget about it.
2706,I agree with all other comments I've read! Flew Sharm to Luxor return last week and have never been so scared on take off or landing both ways. The MD83 was dirty dark and smelly and passenger comfort even on a short flight was non existent. On the return to Sharm we boarded the aircraft through the rear of the plane between the two engines which were/appeared to be slightly running. We had the same cabin crew as the morning flight 14 hours previously and they were virtually fainting from the heat. After sitting on the plane for nearly 20 mins before take off all passengers were incredibly hot to the point of wanting to disembark. The cabin crew did they're best with limited resources. We also received juice and fig roll biscuits both ways but one lucky local passenger was given a hot meal. A holiday rep in the seat in front of us was using his mobile phone during the flight and no one stopped him. The sound of what appeared to be wind rushing through the cabin during the flight did nothing to inspire confidence. I have never been so glad to get off of an aircraft. My advice would be to check with your tour operator before booking an excursion because I would never travel with this airline again.
2707,"Returned yesterday from a fantastic holiday along the Nile and Cairo. However this also included the experience of a lifetime - flying with Memphis Air twice. I am a seasoned air traveller but I have to say that flying with this airline did leave me genuinely frightened at several times during the flights to and from Aswan to Abu Simbel. The worst part was the return to Aswan where the pilot was continuously revving and throttling back the engines seemingly at random. Presumably he did have a reason but it felt as if he was battling with some problem. I decided to keep a check on the faces of the cabin crew and if they looked worried then that would be the time to panic! It genuinely was a scary flight on both occasions. Commenting afterwards a friend of mine described the trip as ""exciting"" which is one thing you do not want to hear during any flight!"
2708,Flight good but you only find out how good a company are when you experience problems. During the recent Volcanic Ash crisis Air Malta offered no help at all to it's customers on outbound flights from Malta to UK. Air Malta provided nothing at all. We were left stranded and had to fund everything ourselves. To date they have failed to reply to all correspondence. They have completely disregarded the European directive relating to compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and cancellation or long delay of flights. I would never ever recommend this company.
2709,When I arrived at check-in I asked for an aisle seat as I suffer from claustrophobia. The check-in attendant made a sarcastic remark along the lines of 'you must be a joy to travel with' which I thought was unnecessary and rude. When I got on the aircraft I found that I had been given a window seat! I do not believe that it was an innocent mistake and if it had not been for a man who agreed to change seats with me I would have had to get off the 'plane. The flight itself was good and cabin crew very pleasant.
2710,MLA-VIE. Attentive cabin crew and announcements from the cockpit kept passengers informed. Food acceptable for duration of the flight. Seat pitch comfortable for a short sector and comparable to any european airline. Will certainly recommend to anyone.
2711,Air Malta from LHR T4. Apart from lack of airline lounges I see Air Malta to equal BA Club Europe for onboard service. Seats were comfortable 3A/C and 1D/F legroom ok plenty of drinks food excellent - great value for money in discounted business out/business back and friendly service. Overall a great flight on holiday for Xmas & New Year but equally good for business travellers.
2712,LHR-DEL-KOL and back. Staff were helpful and I did get a seat with extra legroom on one sector. I don't find this airline good. Toilets are not kept clean during the flight. There were no seat covers on any flight sector. Problems with website on smart phone many options simply don't work. Online check in was therefore not possible for me. My seat area also wasn't up to Western standards of cleanliness. There is no menu for food. 'Continental chicken Indian lamb or Indian vegetarian' isn't really enough info. Drinks selection is very limited. Only one beer choice only 4 spirits (no rum). Entertainment: Of the 10 buttons on my console 5 were ripped out and so using the console was tricky. TV selection doesn't exist at all if your language is English movie selection is very limited. Games are so badly produced they are not fun to play at all. The inflight entertainment system is about where it should have been 15-20 years ago.
2713,Early morning departure from Delhi to Chennai. Aircraft was old A330-200. Interiors looked worn but were clean. A surprising part was that my seat and the one next to it had a safety instruction card for the Boeing Dreamliner! Wonder how that happened and who is responsible for ensuring that safety parameters are adhered to? Hot breakfast served in flight. Landed on time in Chennai. Good value for money.
2714,LHR-DEL round trip in Executive (Business) Class and was most impressed and perplexed at the same time. The seats are truly lie flat on the outbound we were given comfortable cotton PJs but strangely no amenity kit I mean nothing but a sincere apology from the crew. The cabin seating is 2x3x2 unlike most carriers which have 2x4x2 on 777s so seats are comfortable and wide. Crew were happy to make fresh pots of coffee and tea and serve with a smile. The food is rather decent if you like a curry. Great planes clean toilets excellent service tasty food and a more than competitive pricing. The inflight is great if you like Hindi films but well wide of the mark if you want Brit or Hollywood entertainment. I paid for my ticket and would fly them again!
2715,I flew LHR-DEL return in Business Class both ways and was distinctly unimpressed. My ticket was bought for me so I did not have a choice other than Air India. Other than the fact there was a flat bed seat everything else was pretty mediocre. Other than being served on china the meals were economy class standard complete with clingfilm wrap and yoghurt that was 4 days past its sell by date. There were 4 or 5 English- language movies in total but the TV choice was extremely poor - only Hindi language. Cabin crew were friendly but pretty useless - repeated requests for things that only came the 4th time of asking. Given who is up against Air India on this route I definitely would not choose Air India again nor recommend them to anyone.
2716,JNB-CDG-TLV in economy on 17th October. Even if I had 3 seats for myself flying in economy on this A380 is not any better when it comes to comfort of seat compared with other airlines. Crew were very good and helped as much as they could. Food was ok even if appetiser was of poor quality. Most of all I appreciated the new breakfast concept in economy a warm crepe with a very sweet sauce. Small bread roll and croissant jam and some fresh fruit salad usual breakfast drinks. Much better then cold cuts and cheese with some dry bread roll and fruit compote we used to receive well done AF nice improvement. CDG-TLV same service as usual and as early morning flight out of CDG we received what to me looks like a very poor breakfast but food on European flights is always poor.
2717,Flew from MRU to CDG on 19th of October. Aircraft was the high density edition of 77W. Aircraft new clean and in good condition. Boarding on time however a delay of almost one hour occurred without any notice or refreshments. The service was dreadful. I fly very frequently especially with partner KLM but this was the most disappointing service experience. No drink round before dinner no drink round after dinner. No water for the night. FA showed herself 2 times on an 11 hr flight for dinner and breakfast. FA in galley ignorant and unfriendly. AF staff were below par especially in Premium Economy. Will avoid AF in the future and choose partner KLM if possible.
2718,From Paris CDG to Montreal Trudeau and from Atlanta Hartsfield International to Paris CDG. The crew were very polite and helpful especially for the flight back food and beverages were very good much better than other airlines I've used. Nevertheless the seats were hard especially between Paris and Montreal. I highly recommend to avoid flying with the old 747-400 of Air France.
2719,Perth to Mauritius return. Allowed to use Qantas club lounge at Perth which was good as usual. Lounge at Mauritius less impressive and completely full due to number of departing flights. IFE terrible (about 10 films with only one option suitable for children) but otherwise reasonable. Lie flat seats were at quite an angle but reasonably comfortable for short night flight on return leg. Food was better than anticipated. In flight service was reasonable and friendly. Make sure you stick on your 'do not disturb' sticker on a night flight otherwise the staff wake you for breakfast even if you're fast asleep; if you have pre-assigned seats make sure you ensure they've given you those seats at check in; pre-load your own IFE on an ipad or laptop!
2720,London and back in Oct 2012. I wish now I had read the reviews here first otherwise we would not have flow Air Mauritius. I agree with all the other reviews no leg room entertainment box in way of feet the worst food I have had on any flight. My daughter and wife did not eat any of the meals on the outward and return flight.
2721,LHR-MRU-LHR 12 -17 Oct Economy class in extra legroom seats in both directions. Cabin crew were friendly with many drink rounds and smiles all round. I have to say that without the extra legroom seats I could not sit in a normal seat due to the tight space and entertainment box's under the seats. Best thing to do would be to take a few rows out and remove the entertainment equipment as its very outdated.
2722,A340 Mauritius to Heathrow overnight flight generally good reasonable comfort and good service - but why did the aircon have to be at full cold for the whole 12 hour flight making it almost impossible sleep. My wife has walking difficulty and we cannot praise the assistance she had highly enough.
2723,"After a 3 day delay my replacement flight was still late departing and arriving. In flight meal was a sandwich cheese and salami, no options, a small alcoholic drink and good range of juices and tea/coffee. Seating was cramped - made worse than Ryanair as seats recline, it then depends on how considerate passengers are in front of you."
2724,I checked in quickly and was airside for my 08.20 departure on Saturday. The boards then showed a 70 min delay and some while after showed gate opening in 905mins and then 835mins. I found an Air Moldova staff member and was taken landside and explained to that the flight was tech and rescheduled for 21.30. Given meal vouchers and rooms at Radisson but at 15.00 told flight was cancelled. Recovered my bag by 16.30. I am now rebooked for Tuesday. Have to say staff were polite and helpful but in the dark and they were not pleased with late cancellation as rerouting customers late in the day via Heathrow was going to be a problem. Wait and see what Tuesday brings.
2725,LHR-MLA-LHR. Check in was OK both legs. Outbound was on time inbound was delayed more than one hour. Food was bland and need to pay for wine etc but soft drinks free. IFE is basic. Overall for a short flight it was OK and reasonable value for fare paid.
2726,Rome to Malta via Air Malta. When we arrived 3 out of 4 bags checked in didn't make it. We were told by baggage claims we would receive 58 Euros as compensation if we didn't receive our bags within 24 hours. 48 hours later we got two more and the next day got the third. Now I'm back in the USA and they say that's not their policy and I'm yet to find their policy anywhere. Definitely a bad taste to an otherwise pleasant vacation. No more Air Malta flights for me. I'm not even going to comment on the food or delays at the airport in Rome. Probably while they were taking our luggage off to load something else.
2727,LGW-MLA-LGW Second time on this service this year. Hot lunch outbound is slightly improved with bigger main course but dessert now replaced with a tiny bun. Hot breakfast has been cut back - one hotdog sausage a spoon of watery egg and a few baked beans. IFE also cut back to old nature programmes but no headphones! Crew efficient but not particularly friendly. A319 out A320 back clean with reasonable legroom. Swissport check-in at LGW painfully slow as usual Air Malta check-in at MLA very quick.
2728,"Flew LHR to Malta in economy. Going out we had exit row seats with good pitch. Cabin crew not particularly friendly but ok. Food not very good. Coming back we had row 6. It was so cramped. Everyone was complaining. I'm 5'8"" and spent the entire flight with my knees in the seat in front - and if I moved them either the cabin crew or trolley bumped into them. So I had 3.5 hours cramped in a really uncomfortable seat. The cabin crew were even less friendly. I and my neighbours was offered a second coffee but when the senior steward saw what the other steward was doing told her off!"
2729,Kolkata-Silchar-Kolkata3. Kolkata Silchar flight was ATR-42 which does not have much spaces for cabin luggage. However staff helpful to put it in other places. The return flight was A319. As the travelling time was around 1hr minimal food was served.
2730,I traveled from Kolkata to Port Blair in March 2013. Flight was on time. The breakfast served was of good quality. Cabin crew as well as ground staff were helpful.
2731,To and from Kathmandu via New Delhi. I would never use this airline again. The planes are cramped and uncomfortable the seat booking arrangements are chaotic and staff seemed unable or unwilling to explain what the problems were. We had problems both on the outwards and return trips. I had pre-booked seats online - do not do this as it causes all sorts of problems which the airport systems seem unable to override. For example when we asked to change to extra legroom seats at the airport in Kathmandu - we were given a boarding card for the Delhi-London flight but in fact our seats had been cancelled - as we discovered when we came to board. We were bumped off the flight and forced to spend a night in transit hotel limbo. This might have been fine if we had known what was happening and been kept informed but the staff kept us standing like idiots by the boarding gates while they went into huddles over the computer - for hours!
2732,Air India (AI130) from Heathrow to Goa via a stopover to Mumbai and returned 2 weeks later (AI131). All flights departed on time. The seats could have been more comfortable but a cushion between the back and the seat took care of that. The bottom line is that the flights were at least Â£150 cheaper than the nearest rival and so if considered as a budget airline (the long haul Easyjet) I have no real complaints. My main gripe was the attitude of the cabin crew. They were really quite unfriendly smiles never quite made it to eyes - when I was up stretching my legs during the flight I was asked quite abruptly 'where are you going'? However on the whole a reasonably good experience and I'd fly with them again.
2733,Beijing to Paris on 14/09/2013. PNC run being particularly welcoming. The service was friendly and attentive. For once a real team effort. Clear PA announcements in French English and Chinese (a Chinese PNC was on board). Good seat and good VOD. However the cabin aircraft was dated and should be renovated.
2734,Both the Atlanta to Paris and the Paris to Aberdeen flights were great. I appreciated the staff. I do not speak French but found I had no problem communicating with the staff. It also had the best meal I have had on a flight. I was on Air France 681 and 1272 on September 21 and 22. Luggage was taken care of flights on time. I was impressed.
2735,Singapore to Casablanca return via Paris. A decent enough product without being outstanding. On the upside the cabin crew delivered good service with the stewardess on the Singapore/Paris run being particularly welcoming. Seat comfort was good and I got plenty of sleep. And the flights were all on time. On the downside the food wasn't great: edible withouth being especially memorable. I would happily travel with Air France again.
2736,I would not fly Air France again nor would I recommend the airline to anyone. I flew from Singapore to Paris and returned from Frankfurt through Paris back to Singapore. The meals served were not of high standards the length of the flight requires at least snacks to be offered as well as a meal.
2737,PER-MRU-PER. We flew Air Mauritius as a codeshare with Air Austral. All-in-all a fairly reasonable flight experience for the price although we did suffer a quite long delay on the return flight due to technical issues with the aircraft that needed to be sorted out. The cabin attendants were friendly and responsive both ways however there was insufficient water provided during the return flight which in a warmer than usual cabin was disappointing. The food was only fair to be honest but the wine pretty reasonable. My main issue was the ground staff and boarding process at MRU. A lack of updates on the delay and a temporary breakdown of the boarding card readers slowed things down even further. The SSR (Plaissance) airport in Mauritius is okay but fills to bursting when you have 3 flights leaving at once which was the case on the evening we flew. Chaos!
2738,We flew from Mauritius to Anantanrivo and back recently. We were impressed by the efficiency of check in and the punctuality of the flights. Though not expecting any food on this short haul flight we were surprised to receive a quick small lunch with a complimentary drinks run which was most welcome and refreshing. The FAs were pleasant and efficient. The aircraft A340 was clean and leg room was satisfactory for short haul sector. We would recommend this airline.
2739,LHR-CDG-MRU-CDG-LHR. My first flight on 25/05/2012 from LHR was delayed by one hour and I had only 20 mins left to catch my MK flight to MRU. AT CDG there were no ground staff to guide I just managed to catch my flight. Got to my seat found the fellow passenger sitting next to me was intoxicated and immediately started being a real nuisance by interfering with my entertainment system and changing his postured endlessly. I reported this fact to the chief cabin crew. I was given another seat. On arriving at MRU I found out that my baggage was left at CDG so I had to return to MRU the next day to collect it.
2740,"On June 9 2015 my wife and I were returning after a Business trip in Chisinau on flight 9U 895. We had purchased a direct flight from Chisinau to Barcelona. Once boarded we we were told that the flight was going to make a stopover in Lisbon. A surprise because at check in no one had informed us. The captain of the plane did not inform us and apologized over the intercom that the plane had to make a stopover in Lisbon. During the trip from Chisinau to Lisbon the crew gave us a sandwich for lunch and a drink. The stopover in Lisbon was nearly two hours, the crew did not give us anything to drink. On the way from Lisbon to Barcelona the crew did not give us anything to eat, and they did not have any still drinking water. We arrived in Barcelona with a 4 hour delay and we had to wait an hour to collect our bags."
2741,I very recently flew from Frankfurt to Chisinau and I was once again extremely pleased with all aspects of the flight! My flight was operated by an Airbus A320 and was fully packed with passengers. The seats were very comfortable a warm breakfast was served excellent both in quantity and quality! The aircraft however lacked in-flight entertainment. Flight attendants seem to have significantly improved their command of the English language and are also very kind and helpful! The plane took off and landed on-time. The Captain of the flight kept us informed about flight conditions several times throughout the journey. Finally I would definitely recommend flying Air Moldova.
2742,Moscow - Chisinau - Rome and back. I chose Air Moldova because of the low price and very good connections. Unfortunately all flights were delayed (from 30 minutes to 2 hours) with no apparent explanation or apologies. The connection in Chisinau was about 1 hour 20 minutes both times but due to delays we had to practically run to get on the next plane. The Chisinau Airport was fine though much better for short transit that some of the other world airports. The airplanes are really old (I could see duct tape in several places) seats are very tightly packed and also falling apart - I could not recline my seat because the button fell inside the armrest. Inflight meal consisted of a cheese bun which was okay but not sufficient at all. I have to say that wine was served which was quite good and certainly a plus. Crew seemed surly and disinterested although this varied from flight to flight. The biggest problem is on the way back my luggage did not arrive to Moscow. Would I fly Air Moldova again? Maybe if the price is really low (it usually is) but I will keep everything in my cabin luggage.
2743,KIV-OTP on an old but presentable Em120. Flight was on time with good service (sandwich) for the short 1 hour flight. Steward was very friendly speaking good English. We were lucky that day only the flights with Em120 and Em190 were on time. Flights with A320 had 5 to 7 hours delays.
2744,Heathrow to Malta and back economy class. Sat in over wing exit seats both ways so plenty of leg room. The cabin was clean and crew attentive. Free newspaper given out on boarding aircraft. Air Malta seem to be cutting back - while you get a hot meal and free alcoholic drink you only get a small bread roll and tiny dessert. The previously shown movies have been replaced by documentaries and no headphones are given out. Online check in from Malta was painfully slow.
2745,LHR-Malta-LGW August Bank Holiday weekend. The inflight service was good and we were pleasantly surprised with free wine with dinner. The ground service at Heathrow was terrible however. They wouldn't seat my girlfriend and me together despite having made the booking together and wouldn't accept my CSA Czech Airlines OKPlus card for frequent flyer points. The check in attendant and her supervisor claimed Air Malta and Czech Airlines weren't air partners despite both airlines' websites saying so. I complained after the flight to Air Malta but never heard back. They could do with an improvement to their ground service.
2746,Malta-Rome return. Two very pleasant flights with Air Malta. Both departed on time and arrived early. Sensible inflight snack served in a box which was more than adequate for a one hour flight though somewhat strange that no hot drinks available on return flight Luggage retrieval at Rome a bit of a let down but overall a hassle free experience.
2747,Frankfurt to Malta return. Excellent check in and swift baggage return. Basic economy seats and service. On time for all flights helpful staff. At the price I dont expect more.
2748,"LHR-BOM-DEL-LHR. Business. Outbound 777-300ER. Standard business class ""flat"" seats that go to about 175 degrees. Two meal choices an Indian and Western. Fairly standard meal on china but no better than a ""good"" economy meal. No amenity kit but they did supply flight socks and eye masks. Cabin crew helpful. On return lounge in Delhi pleasant but has no WiFi of its own- airport shared wireless is not free. Return flight on 777-200LR (replacement while 787 grounded). No flight socks or eye masks loaded on board - annoying as this was a night flight. Cabin attendants sympathetic and brought what looked like a duvet from first to make up for this. Inflight entertainment is comprehensive. Map not working on return leg. Priority bag service worked both ends and in Mumbai someone has pulled off all the priority bags from carousel so there were there just ready to take. Overall it's good value if your expectations are a lie-flat seat and standard food."
2749,Flew from RUH to CCJ (B777-300ER) in economy class. Flight was on time. Check in was chaotic and ground staff were rude. Flight interiors were clean and looked colourful. Seat configuration of 3-3-3 which I liked. Flight attendants were young polite and happy to help. Entertainment system worked well and had an excellent collection of new English and Hindi movies. Food was very delicious. Overall experience was excellent. Would fly again with Air India.
2750,Flew domestic IXL-DEL in a brand-new A319. Boarding chaotic 2 flights boarded from one gate. Apart from that service was excellent. Especially food was delicious - you do not get that kind of food even on short- haul business flights in Europe. Personal IFE even though some of the screens seemed to work better than others.
2751,LHR-DEL-ATQ. Main flight from London to Delhi was horrible plane had worn carpets and out of date seats most airlines now have better leg room and inflight entertainment. Food was minuscule portions and unrecognisable. Would not bother flying them in the future.
2752,Flew JFK-CDG September 2013. Loved the experience. Comfortable seats. Great food and included wine. Excellent service. On time! I will do it all over again.
2753,"I would never willingly book a flight on Air France again. I have travelled with Air France from Paris to Abu Dhabi in August and from Paris to Johannesburg in September 2013. To Abu Dhabi I specifically booked Etihad only to discover that they are doing a codeshare with Air France. Luckily Etihad have a number of rows specifically for Etihad customers and so I was comfortable to and from Abu Dhabi but the Air France staff were terrible. I even heard the Air France Purser ask an Etihad crew member what they should do to work together well and the Etihad crew member replied ""do things the way we want you to and we'll have no problem"". The flight to Johannesburg was on Air France as my husband wanted to go on a direct flight - even he who travels transatlantic monthly was horrified. Air France have the cheek to email you the day before the flight offering you an upgrade. The first email was for 189 Euros when we tried booking it no joy - when we tried at the airport they said we could upgrade for 489. On the return from Johannesburg the upgrade was offered at 289 Euros still no joy on the internet and at the airport they didn't even understand what I was talking about. Never again."
2754,CDG-SFO 26 Sept. No possibility to checking on line after multiple attempts. Flight Delayed with no apparent reason. Chaotic boarding on CDG as usual. Food very good. Entertainment had some failures headphones malfunctioning but VOD revamped. Comparing with other airlines (Delta Aeroflot) AF seats are simply a joke a bad joke.
2755,Very bad flight from MIL to Mauritius via CDG. Poor service seat pitch the smallest I have experienced on a long haul flight. Never again.
2756,Flew to Mauritius from Edinburgh via CDG. My wife and I could not fault the service from the staff on board although an attempt by a flight steward to fix both our TV monitors failed on the way out. Food and wine was in plentiful supply both ways. The only drawback is that the business class seats do not recline fully flat which can make your sleeping position slightly uncomfortable.
2757,LHR-MRU-LHR. Poor seating told we had bulkhead seats during check-in but found this was not the case upon boarding. On outbound and return flight we had specifically selected the vegetarian option yet no veg meal was available on the return flight. Flight attendants were arrogant as to suggest we had made a mistake in the booking although we had the confirmation to prove the contrary. All in all poor staff training poor inflight experience and poor post-flight service.
2758,LHR-MRU-LHR. Very disappointed with inflight service. The quality of the food was very poor. Entertainment choice was limited and outdated. Staff service was bad. Travelled with children but unfortunately did not specifically request kids meals which meant they were served the adults over spiced food. Travelled in the middle 4 seats (2-4-2) which had the added discomfort that only 2 of the 3 arm rests lifted making it difficult to sleep on the overnight to MRU.
2759,STN-KIV-STN by Airbus 320. Flight was over two hours late leaving Stansted around 20 minutes late leaving Chisinau. Check in was fine. The really bad aspect of the flights was the lack of leg room. Absolutely awful. The inflight 'meal' was a cheese stuffed pastry. Not nice. Staff were fairly friendly but hadn't yet caught up with real customer service. If you over about 1.60 metres tall you will never walk again.
2760,FRA-KIV-OTP with Air Moldova. The first leg was operated by an Embraer 190 aircraft. Flight attendants were attentive throughout both flights. On the first leg the meal included a choice between chicken or beef which was fantastic. On the second flight a warm chocolate croissant was offered for the 45-minute hop. Second leg was an Embraer 120 aircraft which made the second leg of my trip entertaining. I was impressed by the quality of both flights will fly them again!
2761,KBP-KIV. The check-in at Air Moldova was very quick as there was no line. Baggage weight allowances were very strict since we were flying on a small 30 seater Embraer 120 Brasilia. Onboard we were offered complimentary drinks and croissants and even though the plane was small the seats were very reasonable. The flight was kind of shaky but it made the plane ride down to Chisinau very fun. We promptly received our baggage after clearing customs. In conclusion Air Moldova is a fantastic airline!
2762,MLA-LGW Business and BHX-MLA Economy. Good flight in Business class with attentive service and early arrival in LGW. Return flight punctual yet on one of Air Malta's all economy configured aircraft with seemingly less leg-room. Seat comfort is not good. Food service very basic and no service for first 90 minutes due to turbulence. Air Malta are now showing documentary films (Australian Dingoes and Turtles) instead of full length movies though headphones were not offered on the Birmingham flight making the whole point in having films somewhat futile especially as the industrial action by cabin staff is supposed to be over.
2763,LHR-MLA return in economy. Very disappointed with Air Malta service No tea & Coffee no alcohol and no prior notice of this. In-flight entertainment was shown but no headsets were offered! Good seat pitch though so at least something was good. Overall service very poor will avoid in future and travel with alternative airlines.
2764,We were first time flyers with Air Malta. We upgraded to Club Class as we were holidaying without our children and wanted to treat ourselves. We had seats 1D/1F on our outward flight and the first inkling that something was wrong was when we were only offered orange juice or water as we settled into our seats. As we were taxiing for take-off the stewardess announced that due to industrial action the crew would not be serving tea coffee or alcohol. As we had been expecting an open bar with champagne included this was very disappointing. The lunch I was served I didn't eat which is actually a first for me I always eat the food served on airlines. On our return on 12th June we took our seats in Club class seats 1A/1C. Again as we prepared for take-off it was announced about the industrial action so no tea coffee or alcohol would be served. There were some very disgruntled passengers onboard and we were also not happy. There was nothing obvious on their website - I had found a small article dated 30/5 and we were not advised at check-in about this situation. I'm not sure if passengers could have taken their own alcohol onboard and drunk it - but being aware of the situation would have been the decent thing to do.
2765,Connected from Finnair to Air India DEL-BOM-GOI on A321 returned the next week GOI-BOM-DEL on a similar A321. Air India uses T3 at Delhi which is very convenient and their baggage allowance is very generous compared to other Indian carriers. Wanted to try their Business Class and paid extra for the luxury on the DEL-BOM-GOI sector: very pleasant and very good service with tasty meals. On the way back it was Economy and cannot fault their service here either because the legroom was good IFE worked well and their catering was adequate. The dinner on the BOM-DEL sector was actually very good in Economy. This is not the Air India I remember from years back they have improved considerably and seem to have added many new planes in their fleet lately. Moreover the fact that they use T3 at Delhi Airport is a great advantage smooth connections.
2766,Flew AI in November 2012 LHR-DEL-CCU return (AI112 A20 AI21 AI111). Check in swift generous baggage allowance. Flight was an hour late hence didn't cause much of a stir. In-flight decor seating etc.- appalling! Torn carpets and upholstery tired interiors poor lighting creaky and cramped seats poor back support made for a low comfort ride. Ground staff and in-flight staff - were excellent. Inflight entertainment: fair with a bias towards Indian programmes. Meals provided on LHR-DEL could certainly do with improvement arrived in sterile plastic containers cold not fresh. It certainly did not qualify as a wholesome 'Indian treat'. In contrast meals served on DEL-CCU-DEL-LHR were fresh full of flavour. Baggage handling: can do with improvement. Overall they did a good job with honest pricing of tickets and generous baggage allowances with room for improvement in some departments.
2767,MAA-CMB-MAA. Check in was by Air India Staff and was good. Flight was on time. Buses were new and good AC. Ground staff at boarding were rude. Flight Interiors were dirty and shabby. It needed a through cleaning. Seats were old and worn. Flight attendants were OK. Food was nice enough for the money I paid and an 1 hr flight. Overall value for money. Cleanliness could be improved.
2768,Flew AF111 (MU8661) on 1 October PVG-CDG. A380 and AF1680 CDG-LHR. A320. Check-in at PVG wasn't great apparently the staff member couldn't see my onward connection to LHR. The Lounge at PVG leaves a lot to be desired. Once on- board the A380 things were much better. The seat was comfortable and although doesn't lie flat I managed a good 5 hours sleep. Service by the male flight attendant working my section was excellent. IFE was limited and my screen kept crashing. Food was excellent. The CDG-LHR leg was usual European seating but service was efficient and friendly. I would fly again.
2769,Flight AF1960 CDG-TLV on September 29. The flight left with about half-an-hour delay. The food (the breakfast) was very poor the service was quite friendly but nothing special the aircraft was dated. Most irritating was an absence of any normal entertainment even on a flight of about 4.5 hours. Generally Air France is worst company I have flown with.
2770,I had an Air France flight about 10 years ago and had a pretty bad experience - delays multiple times over 2 different airports. I and my wife decided to take Air France this time again hoping this would not be the case. Again the company disappointed us gravely. 5 delays notices between SFO Paris and Zurich. Unbelievable. Staff service is bad as well. These stewards threw the food tray at you the French service quality is well known and I've experienced many times in France so I don't expect much. They need to change.
2771,GVA-CDG on 22 August on an A319 and the in-flight service was as good as I have ever experienced. Friendly efficient and. for once clear PA announcements. The short flight was full and as is often the case one passenger could not read her seat allocation so a double seat allocation occurred which was quickly and pleasantly rectified by a member of all female cabin crew. Upon arrival in Paris I was in no hurry to disembark (unlike everyone else on board) so spent a little time chatting with the cabin crew and was even invited into the Flight Deck to meet the Captain and First Officer where the flown route was explained in some detail. All in all very pleasant and charming crew. The only minor complaint I would note is the lack of information on the ground in Geneva to explain a 45 minute delay.
2772,DEL-MRU-DEL. DEL-MRU flight was to depart at 5.20am but got delayed and finally took off at 10am. Airport staff were accommodating and gave us snacks and coffee. Onboard FA's were not attentive and you had to request again and again before being served a glass of water. Food and IFE was average. Return flight on time and was better. Adequate drinks and good food made the return flight pleasant.
2773,Flight from Mauritius to Hong Kong was very poor. Although some staff were professional the plane was old the seats buckled and there was not enough food. In the past Air Mauritius was a great airline now service has dropped.
2774,LHR-MRU. A very long night due to babies crying but food was nice unlimited though you have to ask for it and cabin crew very friendly. Seats a bit tight luckily had two spare seats next to me so I laid down. Quite a few blockbusters to watch if you really can't sleep. A bit late in baggage delivery. MRU-CDG. Excellent food smiling staff and superb service.
2775,LGW-KIV on Embraer 190. Departed on time and arrived a little early. FA's were polite and efficient. Catering was a sandwich and a choice of Hot drinks Soft drinks and Moldovan Wine. No IFE but not a problem on a 3hr flight. Only strange aspects were the very stocked duty free trolley coming through the plane but with absolutely no price lists or catalogues so I had no idea what they were selling and that the cockpit messages to staff were in Romanian which surprised me as most airlines now do them in English. Just one quick note be prepared to be locked in the airport for a while. My luggage actually came through first but when I cleared customs and headed for the exit I could see my friends waiting for me but the doors taking me landside were locked after much rattling around 10 mins later a staff member came and pressed the button to let us out! I would gladly fly with them again and the direct flight makes this the best option on this route.
2776,KIV-FRA-KIV. The plane was an Embraer 190 in spotless condition. Tasty hot meals both ways and a good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Flights departed and landed on time. Connecting luggage arrived safely. Gate staff friendly and courteous. Onboard flight attendants looked a bit tired and could smile more.
2777,Was scheduled to fly IST-KIV on June 12. Learned 5 days before the flight that the service on that day was cancelled. Was offered a seat on the next day's flight transfer from/to airport and free hotel accommodation. A big thanks to the Air Moldova representative in Istanbul Sinan who was super helpful in arranging the details of my overnight stay in Istanbul. He accompanied me to the hotel met me at the airport the next day and was extremely friendly throughout my dealings with Air Moldova. Onboard the service consisted of a cold meal and a selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. FAs could learn to smile more. Plane a new spotless Embraer 190 with comfortable pitch and leather seats.
2778,VIE to KIV. The experience was quite odd like going back into the Soviet days as they were using a Yak-40 on the flight. Staff friendly and relatively professional although it felt almost like a charter flight. The meal was quite good and flight was on time. The cabin layout was really bizarre with something looking like a couch near the front of the plane and little leg room in my seat. The fact that they didn't de-ice the plane (it was snowing hard at takeoff) freaked me out a bit too. Not sure if they're still using the Yak-40 but if you happen to get on this one it's certainly a unique experience if you're up for it.
2779,OTP-KIV-IST return. OTP-KIV canceled due to fog instead put on the TK service to IST. For the IST-KIV on well maintained Embraer 190 with friendly and professional FAs. KIV-OTP delayed 1.5 hours but they kept passengers informed. Boarding was a bit chaotic as they could not figure which plane should depart first. They used a fairly old but clean A320-200 and staff were nice. For the price paid attentive service and helpful staff.
2780,LHR-BOM-LHR return Boeing 777-300ER. Our seats were comfortable inflight entertainment was good with variety of games and Hindi and English movies. Check in at Heathrow was quick and at Mumbai airport. Tip - always check in online for both legs which saves a lot of time and ensure you don't exceed allowances. Food was good but once crew served the food and collected the rubbish after meals they disappeared and never came to serve and drinks or walk around on plane - nor attended to crew attention buttons when pressed.
2781,FRA-DEL-COK return. Check-in at Frankfurt had a long line which moved quickly. Boeing 787 replaced by B777-300ER food was good IFE had a very limited choice of movies. Crew was neither friendly nor rude. Bag delivery in DEL took quite a while. DEL to COK was on-schedule. The seats were uncomfortable as you could feel the metal in your back. When flying to India from Germany the Middle East airlines are definitely a better choice. Air India had the best flight times the price was okay.
2782,My wife and I flew non-stop from Chicago to Delhi. Left on January 22 and returned on January 30 on Boeing 777-300ER. Our seats were very hard and uncomfortable my backrest evidently lost it's memory and refused to stay in the upright position front seat pocket was partially glued together with a disgustingly big wad of chewing gum the inner plastic window insert kept rattling in unison with the jet engines. Coffee was the absolute worse I have tasted flight staff were good. It got us there and it got us back home.
2783,Flight AF084 from CDG-SFO on Sep 21. Boarding from CDG was tricky as always due to unmanageable passengers not respecting boarding instructions. Warm welcome onboard from FAs. Seats configuration was 3-4-3 (B777-300ER) with an awful and uncomfortable seat (mine was in row 23J in the Economy zone). Obviously folks from AF who have designed this seat had never traveled in a 12 hours long-haul flight! Food was correct while FAs service was really poor - our FA just skipped the coffee during the 2nd service before landing for a long time chat with another passenger and ignored the rest of the passengers!
2784,Manchester - CDG - Hong Kong 16 Sep 2013. Business Class. I'd summarise the AF experience as adequate but at the lower end of BC experiences. The 777 BC seats are somewhat tired these days and the stupid design means a window seat passenger cannot get past the PAX next door if they are reclined. Food was somewhat poor compared to the trip I made from Shanghai to CDG a couple of months earlier - didn't eat anything on this leg (serving foie gras is just offensive AF). Cabin staff not especially friendly. So better than EC but only because of the extra room. AF really need to get their act together - I won't use them again.
2785,LHR-SFO with a change at CDG. LHR-CDG flight was a short one enough to give an overall good impression. Flight lasted less than an hour but were offered drinks and a pastry breakfast. Staff were friendly and the cabin was clean. Flight from CDG-SFO was brilliant. Very satisfied with the entire flight the seats were comfortable! Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. Once we began to taxi on the runway the personal video screens changed from the standard screen to show a live camera from the cockpit! The video screens themselves were really good. There were no grids and the picture was clear. The sound also worked well. The controls were responsive and there was a really good selection. Impressed with the food. I usually pre-order a special meal but I decided to chance the standard meal. I had a chicken in sauce main course with couscous. I got a nice roll with a good sized wedge of packaged brie a large thick slice of packaged pineapple and a really tasty good sized chunk of brownie for dessert. 1.5-2 hours before landing we got our second meal. I got pieces of seasoned chicken with potatoes and a sauce. There was lemon tart for dessert along with another bread roll and package of cream cheese. The entire flight was enjoyable. The plane was comfortable and clean. The staff were friendly and polite and spoke fluent English. The announcements from the cockpit were clear and the captain gave little updates throughout the flight. I would definitely fly Air France again.
2786,Boeing 767 on a trip to Paris (CDG) via Singapore. The only element that was good was the refreshment they were typical western style. Not good was the seat they are not wide enough very narrow. On the flight back it was the same.
2787,Travelled PER-MRU twice. Reasonably priced seats the timing of flight departure is an absolute nightmare at 2am don't understand why it has to be so late. Plane is fairly uncomfortable with hard seats and lack of leg room. A warning alarm came on 1 hour into return flight and we had to wait around in transit hall for 2 hours in early am. Only direct flight to MRU which is a pity.
2788,Very disappointed with the inflight service. Flight from Mauritius to Heathrow is 12.5 hrs. Usually on long flights flight attendants on other airlines would on several occasion offer passengers a glass of water. With Air Mauritius not once did the flight attendants offer water to passengers. You have to ask for it. Once the food was served their duty was done. The quality of the food was very poor. The entertainment choice was limited and outdated.
2789,LHR to MRU. Good cabin crew although a bit slow to reset my entertainment system on time flight and baggage arrived as well. Return leg was good 2 meals breakfast lunch and a snack before landing. Seats are cramped my knees were touching the seat in front. Crew don't smile.
2790,Business class Moscow to Chisinau. I was the only business class passenger. Good condition A320. Flight was on time FA was smart pretty smiling and hospitable. Cabin service was fine - a full breakfast served and service was attentive. I was pleasantly surprised.
2791,OTP-KIV return on new Embraer 190. The flight was quick and the little snack was more than ok. Flight Attendants were only interested in some passengers and didn't really care at all for the others. I felt sort of unsafe as no particular attention was brought to passengers calling on cellphone or using electronic devices during take off and landing! My return trip was with the small Embraer 120 for KIV-OTP flight. This very old little plane of 30 seats only was comfy and I felt safe. The single cabin crew who was working was smiling kind and hospitality was great. We left and arrived on time.
2792,OTP-KIV Embraer 120 Economy Class. The airplane is old and uncomfortable. Whilst waiting in Bucharest had to approach the information desk and ask for explanations with regard to the late opening of the check-in counter. In fact with 20 minutes before scheduled departure the check-in hadn't opened. No announcements or apologies from the airline staff. Tarom-operated flights on this route are a better alternative. The only good thing about this flight was the responsive attitude of the FA on board. Otherwise Air Moldova needs to get its grip together if they want to retain customers.
2793,Flew Air Moldova on the Chisinau - London Stansted route. Check-in efficient and quick boarding. The Airbus 320 was in good condition and crew very welcoming. Once on-board offered a cold meal and one round of drinks. Air Moldova makes a technical stop in Paris to drop-off and pick-up passengers on this route. Given that total flight time to London including the stop in Paris is over 5 hours I think it does make sense to serve a hot meal and at least another round of drinks. I guess this was the only disappointment with Air Moldova.
2794,BOM-DXB-BOM Airbus 320 both ways with 3x3 configuration. Contrary to previous reviews I really like this product. The leg space was superb outbound flight left on time food adequate and filling. IFE selection was limited. FAs were nice and helpful. Inbound flight was redeye. Delayed by 1 hr and reached BOM late. Again food was delicious and same IFE with same movies. Check in smooth in DXB but in BOM a bad experience. I was travelling with my parents and unfortunately even after repeated requests we were given seats separately. All in all a good airline with comfy seats and good onboard service and cheaper than other airlines.
2795,Great travel experience I had back in Aug 2011 on Air India was the reason to choose this airline for my 2012 travel. The transit/immigration through the new DEL airport was smooth. AI faced major delays on my return leg due to computer error at DEL and I ended up spending my time enjoying the new DEL T-3. The cabin crew kept an astounding service quality before the aggressive demanding passengers on board which made the journey memorable. Flaws occur but its very good to see AI is keeping up its pace to superior service quality.
2796,23 December from LHR to Mumbai on the dreamliner. Plane itself was nice and the food and entertainment was fine although not much in the way of films/games for children. Luckily we had done online check-in for the connecting flight to Delhi as well. I handed in my luggage at the international terminal in Mumbai but this was not on the flight. After numerous telephone calls the luggage arrived on 26. Flight from Delhi to Chandigarh took off despite the pilot telling us there would be little chance of the fog clearing which meant that we circled above Chandigarh 4 times before returning to Delhi. Chaos on arrival and were it not for 2 helpful passengers things could have been a nightmare as no onward transport had been planned. It eventually left in the form of a coach 2-3 hrs later. For international flights AI is good but for domestic flights it is chaotic and staff are very unorganised. I would avoid Delhi airport if possible.
2797,Flew business class with my wife and 20 month old toddler to from Windhoek to Cape Town and back. Both flights left on time and boarding was pretty quick even though the flights were pretty full. Onboard service was extremely good. The flight attendants were very friendly and helped with the little one where they could and made the flights a very relaxing experience. They are using relatively new Airbus A319 which were clean and comfortable. Food was good but this usually is the case with Air Namibia on all their flights. No on board entertainment on the flight but for 1hr 50 minutes this was not a problem.
2798,AMS-MRS on a newly configured Air France A319. The seats don't really recline a la Ryanair but they are far more comfortable. Service was minimal but I appreciated getting a real (espresso) coffee. Staff service was excellent although no explanation or apology was given for the delay. Arrival to Marseille smooth and bags came out quickly. Would fly again.
2799,"We were in the upper deck of the A380 on a direct flight from CDG to LAX last month. Navigating CDG is a challenge but the very comfortable lounge was a welcome respite after trudging what seemed like forever. This was our first experience with the A380 and were very pleased with the remarkably quiet upper deck. We also appreciated the dedicated passenger ramp at both ends of the journey that made entrance and exit very easy. The flight crew was outstanding very polite and personable. The were very accommodating to my requests for meals whether light or full whenever I wanted them. Food and wine quality was excellent. I echo the comments of other passengers regarding the seats. I'm 6'2"" 200 lbs and the ""sleeping"" position was very uncomfortable for me. Sitting comfort was just okay. My wife is much shorter so it wasn't as much of an issue for her. As an aside the seats on the AF 777's are no better. I'm not sure who AF Airbus and Boeing used to test the design for a business class seat but they obviously recruited no one my size or larger. That aside the overall experience was very good and I would recommend AF."
2800,I flew AF 256 on 20/8/13 upgrading to premium economy at CDG for a substantial price. Unfortunately my expectations were not met with what was a less than satisfactory onboard service. On boarding I was allocated seat 21A which I identified immediately was broken I brought this to the attention of the male flight attendant. The seat would not stay in its retracted position and I had concerns that this would not be safe. I was most disappointed when this was not dealt with. He returned to say that it would be ok and continued on. The service in general in prem-Eco was less than satisfactory. On arrival into SIN and deplaning I brought it to the attention of the female cabin crew positioned between pre-Eco / economy and asked that it be reviewed prior to the return flight to Paris. She stated that her flight was finished and it was not her problem. It is for this reason that I would not consider flying Air France again.
2801,London-Mauritius return on 23rd Jan. Plane only half full so lots of space my son had a bad tooth and was looked after very well. Food was fine quite a good flight with no complaints crew were excellent. Have flown with a lot worse airlines supposedly of better quality.
2802,Hong Kong to Mauritius return - wasn't a bad trip but the seat was a bit congested and the food quantity was not good. There should be a great variety of food but there were only two which excluded the vegetarian meal both ways. Having Air-Mauritius to be the only possible direct airline to Mauritius the ticket was very pricey.
2803,LHR-MRU return. Flew out December returned Jan in economy class on a A340-300 with window seats on both flights. Flight staff on the ground and cabin crew helpful. Food quality generally ok. You could have as many drinks as you required. However that's where the positives end the seating was cramped and no way is the seat pitch 33/34 inch as stated. The recline space available is also very poor so you never feel comfortable quite the opposite with no chance of any sleep. The entertainment system is also disappointing with limited choice of films and music.
2804,Worst airline ever. Business class ticket they lost our luggage and did nothing to find them. We spent 8 days in Mauritius with a 15 months old baby and without any luggage a nightmare. Our luggage were lost in Nairobi. It's not the first time it happens but with other airlines they usually find them and deliver them in a couple of days. Service in the flight is bad. From Nairobi to Mauritius you get a kind of breakfast when you board then after nothing not even a glass of water! And we travelled business class!
2805,Business class from LHR to DEL Dec 2012 return. No complaints - all staff and crew were helpful. Plane was a new 777 and seats were very comfortable with a lot of legroom. The inflight entertainment had a good choice of English and Indian films. My only gripe is the lack of an Air India lounge for Business Class passengers at IGI airport in Delhi. It's unacceptable to send your premium passengers to a regular cafe with poor quality food and no WiFi where the staff are trying to charge you for anything they can get away with. Please Air India stop using Cafes at IGI and get yourselves a proper business class lounge with WiFi decent food and drink.
2806,Flew from Jodhpur to Mumbai on AI 475 (A319-VT-SCI). Flight delayed 1.5 hours and were informed by a call and an SMS after reaching Jodhpur airport. Light snacks served on board and the aircraft had a functioning IFE. Minus the 1.5 hour delay the flight was okay.
2807,Business class from Singapore to Delhi on an A319 and it's was fairly basic. The seats are old and not that comfortable - leg room is ok though. Service from the cabin crew - nothing to get excited about either. They were quite stoic did their basic job and then sat (slept) on the forward jumpseat the rest of the flight. There was a breakfast service (the food was not bad) but they never came through an offered anything else - - nothing. The economy class had a second beverage service - but if you wanted something extra in business class - you had to ring your call button and then they would reluctantly come out of the galley. The inflight entertainment is very basic too - all Indian movies.
2808,We flew LHR to Mumbai and on to Goa and return via Delhi. Flights were cheap and therefore I agree that they were value for money. Most of the inflight entertainment didn't seem to work across the cabin or the films packed up. The seats were possibly the most uncomfortable I have encountered they were narrow and the cushions non existent and the toilets smelt. The crew were friendly and attentive on the way out but appeared infrequently on the way back. Food on both flights was horrible. I wish we had paid more and gone with another carrier.
2809,"SW286 in economy in mid December 2014. I've taken this flight a number of times over the past 10 years this ranked as one of the better experiences by far. First and most important Air Namibia is now using a pair of relatively new leased Airbus 330-200s on this route. The difference between this and the old Airbus Boeing 747s and MD8s are striking. The passenger cabin is clean relatively modern and well lit. The seats have seat-back entertainment systems. I travel with an iPad pre-loaded with movies I want to watch so I can't speak to the entertainment menu itself. The food was relatively bland - simple but edible. They serve a ""breakfast"" close to landing but it's not up to much. Seat comfort - I was in 20H on the aisle adjacent to the bathrooms. Seat doesn't recline but there is no electrical box under the seat in front of you in row H. Flight departed FRA on time and arrived Windhoek 15 minutes early. The flight attendants were for the most part polite efficient and attentive without being fussy or cloying. This works fine for me but not for everyone. The flight is quite rigorously structured - drinks with a hot meal are served relatively soon after takeoff. The cabin lights are then turned off completely for the bulk of the flight (at least 6 hours). The cabin lights don't come back on until 2 hours before landing. All in all good value for the money and much more comfortable than I remember in the past. I remember this flight being more of an endurance ordeal than anything else I've flown SW286 on and off since 2000 and these new planes make all the difference."
2810,Windhoek-Cape Town return in May. The flying product of Air Namibia is very good indeed. New Airbus A319 with good seat comfort. Cheerful cabin crew and ok food. Inflight entertainment on the boring side but no problem for such a short flight. I did like it. What lets them down is the awful administration it takes ages to reach someone by phone and their so called call centre puts you on a loop whenever you are calling. So for me it was thumbs up for the flight and thumbs down for the admin.
2811,WDH-JNB. Flight departed on time food was good and service very professional. Seat comfort for a short-haul flight excellent! Boarding in Windhoek could be better. There was no priority counter. As with SAA passengers from Eco should not be allowed to use the toilet in Business class. The flight attendants should see to this.
2812,"We have traveled all over the USA and Europe for over 30 years. This trip was 3 weeks long we were on American Airlines British Airways Iberia etc. with the same luggage. But Air France charged us Â£60 each for small carry on bags that all other airlines allow free. The check in clerk was very rude and rigid in typical French fashion. They were proud to say that they are different and do not belong to the ""One World Alliance"". The on board experience was just as bad flight attendants were rude and unwelcoming service was poor. This was a pleasure trip and Air France took all of the joy out of air travel. We will never fly Air France again and would not recommend."
2813,BSL-CDG-IAD / JFK-CDG-BSL. The short legs on ATR 72 were nice solid. Quick round of drinks and choice of snack. Easy check in / boarding due to small plane and few passengers. Changing in CDG between 2E and 2G absolutely without a problem via airside shuttle bus and many signs. CDG-IAD on A380 with mixed results: Economy seats on upper deck are a plus when travelling as a couple - only 2 seats at window with nice little storage compartment between seat and window. Very good choice of films/music on IFE. However for an airplane of 2.5 years of age the interior looks like straight from the 90s: egg-shell-whiteish plastic and a smallish screen. The weirdest thing is that the screen is offset to the left to accommodate the remote control on the right. This makes for awkward angles of head/neck while watching films. Seats quite hard but enough leg room for me (6 ft 6). Crew very nice and open bar in the galleys throughout flight. Still do not understand the boarding process: They started boarding 40 minutes before departure despite 500+ passengers and a more thorough check due to flight to the US. Departure therefore almost an hour late. JFK-CDG in 10 year old 777-200 with the same seats/video screens/interior design. Crew very nice. They recognized me not fitting in my regular seat (albeit officially the same pitch in 380 and 772) so they moved me to bulkhead seats with lots of leg room. Seats very hard. Weird time of serving a good selection of (for airplane standards) good food: After a midnight takeoff they started serving a full dinner despite almost all passengers longing for sleep. All in all a good experience with some quirks that need to be cleaned up.
2814,BKK-CDG-HAM. My AF Flight was a morning flight at 9.45 am. Check-in staff very friendly and helpful flight full on B777 10 seat abreast in Y Class very tiny seat with footrest tiny aisle very cramped. Crews very rude didn't want to speak English 2 hours after departure crews begun with service lunch (only 1 choice) but high quality and quantity with bottle of red and port wine packed in the food tray only soft drinks and beer were offered finalized with coffee and tea. 30 mins later Duty Free offered after Duty Free informed that self- service bar with soft drinks was offered at the galley from that time on FA's were absent. No water or beverage offering during the flight until next snack service (sandwich croissant cheese tea and coffee) 2 hours before landing. Luckily AF has a very good IFE on board. Transiting at CDG 2E to 2F was smooth and easy (not horror as reported). CDG-HAM on A321 with croissant and soft drink. Other disappointing: no glass of champagne for Y class as advised in the website and newspapers.
2815,BHX-CDG-BHX. Outbound flight fine on time and good service on board consisted of complimentary snack and drink. Plane was an Embraer type narrow body with a 2x2 configuration. Plenty of leg room and leather seats made it a comfy experience. No IFE as only a 45 minute flight. Return flight I arrived late at the check-in (25 mins before the departure time). I can't praise the AF ground staff highly enough for getting me on that flight particularly as I was due to attend a wedding back in the UK. The flight was the same as the outbound one. AF still takes some beating on this short hop.
2816,I was delayed more than 48 hrs in Shanghai Pudong Airport! The whole ordeal started when we boarded the plane we were told there was a technical problem and take off would be delayed. The crew had to open the middle doors for us as it was getting too hot inside. During the 4 hr wait we did not get any food or drinks! We were driven finally after 5 hours on the tarmac back to the terminal to be dumped in the airport hotel without food or information. For the next 2 days we were left without any info on the flight! We had to fight with airport staff to get our luggage back after more than 24hrs. Absolutely unprofessional management of problems lying to customers covering up a major problem and never getting back to us for any kind of compensation.
2817,My Family and I flew Singapore to Mauritius and return via KL. We were impressed with good inflight customer service including the food having travelled there new Airbus A330-200.
2818,Melbourne-Mauritius-Nairobi return pleasantly surprised by the level of service we received. For both long haul services requested and received exit rows - which can be quite difficult to do with other airlines. I found the seats comfortable food was fine and there was never any issue about heading down to the back galley to get a drink when you felt like one. The staff on the whole were very friendly. Mauritius airport itself is very small and cramped but this should not be a problem when the new terminal opens.
2819,Flew domestic on a very early flight from Delhi to Nagpur. Checked in at the airport and this was fast and efficient. Straight through domestic security into the large airside lounge area with shops and cafes open despite the outlandish time (04.30). Flight boarded early and was not full. A319 looked tired and seats were old. Service was fine but food as poor - a greasy wrap - with hot drinks. Landed on time in Nagpur and deplaned quickly.
2820,Travelled from Frankfurt to Delhi and back. The new dreamliners are servicing this route and the flight experience was excellent. Ample leg room large comfy seats in economy big overhead luggage space amazing lighting and windows.. The entertainment options were good and the flights were smooth. The food could have been better! I have travelled Air India before as well but this was the only time I enjoyed travelling with them.
2821,FRA-WDH (Windhoek)-WVB (Walvis Bay): First of all bear in mind that this in an airline that only operates 10 aircraft's in total (out of which only 2 are wide body) so just do not expect them to have the same kind of resources of competitors with much higher economics of scale. Brand new A330-200 (delivered 2013) serving Frankfurt - Windhoek route with relatively simple business seats (2 setting only meal/upright and lie flat) any other position in between could be adjusted by pressing continuously either one of these 2 functions. Leg part is for thigh support only as an extension for calf an ottoman is provided where shoes could be stored underneath. Simple and tidy without confusing buttons. Meals are served in very basic cutlery (on plastic tray) but the taste is surprisingly good (choices between meat/chicken and fish/seafood plus entree and dessert). Crew efficient and friendly without being pretentious. Luggage handling excellent with priority collection for business. Overall an Airline product that well represents Namibia: relax neat and tidy. Definitely recommended if your final destination is Namibia.
2822,Windhoek-Cape Town Business. Good boarding perfectly on time. New A 319 with extremely comfortable Business- seats (2-2 configuration new seats with plenty of rooms). Breakfast was good flight attendants very attentive and checking on the passengers. On time arrival. Can't get better than this flight and price was reasonable.
2823,Had a very pleasant experience on my flight from Frankfurt to Johannesburg via Windhoek on the new A330-200. Check-in swift and friendly staff. Boarding easy. Departed on time and arrived 30 min ahead of schedule in Windhoek with a 1 hour layover going to Johannesburg. The new A330 is very pleasant seats are very comfortable and was able to sleep for most of the time. Will be using Air Namibia on my future trips.
2824,Flight AF695 MIA-CDG 12/08/2013: This flight is operated with one of the last 7 B747 that remains in operation with Air France. Crew were nice and the flight was on time both at departure and arrival. Meals were good and on best standard around for Airlines. Now there comes the downsides: the seats are some of the worst I've flown. Then the IFE crashed throughout the airplane just few minutes after takeoff the crew restarted it 3/4 times without success. Lastly was the seat was not cleaned at all: there was trash in my front pocket and some trash under the seat also the two rows near me was full of trash the crew apologized and cleaned while before departure. At least a nice and gentle crew.
2825,ICN-CDG. Run down seats (old generation) several parts in seat and armrests missing. No lie-flat seat. Too short (I am 1.87 cm - I guess it can only accommodate persons up to 1.75 cm). I complained to the crew who was very attentive to my comments but could not do anything but agree. Food: average for business class. A bad experience.
2826,I flew from Paris CDG to Hamburg through the modern terminal 2F. The flight was good and the crew were polite and helpful. The seats had a good recline even for a short flight of 1.5hrs. The one thing that I regret is the food choice - only croissants were offered. I will use this airline again for my next trip.
2827,London Heathrow to Mauritius return. I'm 5'10 and average build and found I had sufficient room to recline and doze a bit for the 12 hr flight. The inflight entertainment was good with a large touchscreen offering recent movies tv documentaries and games - all on-demand. The only drawback is that the screen is sometimes too touch sensitive or not at all which can be frustrating at times. Going out mine froze all together once but the stewardess reset it within minutes. The food was tasty and service not intrusive. However there was no announcement that drinks were always available in the galley - I only knew this from previous reviews. Flight out was just 1 hr delayed due to late inbound arrival but return flight taxied dead on time and arrived 30 mins early.
2828,Paris to Mauritius return on Business with a promotional fare. Warm welcome from staff served a choice of pre- flights drinks with a local tropical touch. Starters main courses and desserts tasty and again with a creole twist that was memorable. The lie-flat seat is comfortable with relax and massage options. Plenty of space for storage and water bottles provided before going to sleep. Only 2 things to improve - the IFE is not on-demand and the choice of movies is limited there are no snacks/drinks buffet on overnight flights which last about 11 hrs. Otherwise a satisfying trip where I managed to get 7 hrs sleep.
2829,Mauritius to London Heathrow. The service was below average. Food was satisfactory although served chicken for every meal. The television did not work I told a cabin crew member 3 times and she simply said 'ok I'll come back to you' she didn't for 12 hours. As for the other points they were satisfactory. Not much leg space and variety of films and shows.
2830,"MAU to SYD. Flight was ok nice aircraft but as for cabin service - well your on your own. If you need the toilet join the line of Economy passengers for Business Class facilities. A request for water was met with ""try economy""."
2831,Travelled from Mumbai to Bangalore. Early morning departure from Mumbai. Aircraft A321 neatly maintained. Pushback on time and smooth take-off. Hot breakfast served onboard. Asked for a second helping of fruit bowl and was immediately provided with one. Inflight channel had a latest Indian movie going on though the Flight path channel stopped working half an hour into the flight. FA's quite attentive to passenger needs . Landed on time in Bangalore. Air India seems to be improving it's quality of service by the day. Will fly them again.
2832,Delhi to Chicago on AI127. 16 hour flight with no working inflight entertainment. The food was horrible and served in foil trays. No fruit or salad. Our confirmed seats were changed and we had to switch with someone. 9 hours later breakfast was served. No snacks or coffee served between meals. We will stay away from Air India.
2833,BKK-DEL-KTM-BKK in business class. BKK-DEL airplane old seats are old no footrest. Toilet reeks of moth balls served same food as in coach in foil container. KTM-DEL-BKK same old plane asked for a blanket and received a used and stained one. No Ice on board no Immigration form on board no fast track offered. Had Non veggie continental and they served me cold spaghetti Bolognese. Poor service is one problem but biggest problem with their staff.
2834,Flight AI 317 19 Nov HKG to DEL-BOM. This deals with the 777 service HKG to DEL. Flight was inbound from Seoul and even though we saw the plane for 2 hours + at the gate we were still late. Security boarding was extensive and a joke. Seat was broken but was found another. Flight attendants were grumpy. When we finally took off bar service started with tray table unceremoniously taken out in front of you with a bang. You had to have a drink no question. Then the food came. Was told prawn curry or vegetarian. No menu. No choice. It all came on 1 tray. Flight had not been provisioned correctly so 1/3 of business class got economy meals. Seat went back all the way to horizontal so I slept but cabin was freezing. Arrived in Delhi late. Disembarking the galley floors were flooded/cluttered which was awful. Transfer to connecting flight was badly handled. AVOD was a joke. It was very complicated and a choice of all of 4 new films.
2835,FRA-WDH. Business Class. Separate check-in was efficient. Access to Cathy Pacific lounge. Flight took off on time landed on time. Three course meal + breakfast. Appetizer (smoked salmon) and desert (cheese plate) were good. Wine selection was solid. Main course was below average. Seats were circa 12 years ago. No AVOD but several channels to choose from. My video worked. My colleague in another row was not so lucky. When she brought this up our flight attendant mentioned how the staff was looking forward to the new A330s. Simple touches would have refined my overall view menu cards a little more attention to make up for the sub-par seats etc but overall it was a good flight.
2836,WDH-CPT. Business Class Flight departed on time/landed on time. Loads of leg room in both economy and business. I would argue too much leg room in business class (I'm short) but it was more than normal. Business class has in- seat video systems but was not available on shorter routes. Service went like this: welcome drink newspapers coffee/tea breakfast (food was very good). I went to the back cabin during the flight to stretch my legs it was ?œEconomy Plus??seating throughout. At airport I did noticed the business class luggage came out last. Overall a good product new airplane.
2837,Frequent Flyer with Air Namibia part of their Rewards programme. Live in Cape Town but work in Namibia every 6 weeks for a week. Use to fly Economy but because of their old planes I moved over to Business. They have however moved to new planes which is fantastic. Still fly Business though. Leg room is great but don't like the harder leather seats (still need to be warn in). On-board attention is good enough (even in business). Its only a 2hr flight to Windhoek so there's only so much attention that I ask for. Only problem I have is the coffee on-board (Business Class). It really is disgusting. However all in all a great airline.
2838,Business Cabin was very old. It was impossible to sleep because of the old seat. The entertainment was not working. The wine was very bad I couldn't eat the food. Cabin stuff ignored the PAX (it was a better crew on the way back). FRA-WDH trip - not worth the money. I will avoid Air Namibia!
2839,"Recent trip from BOS to CDG as a SkyTeam Elite was anything but pleasant. I am enrolled in Delta's program rather than AF's (though I probably fly AF and KLM more than Delta) and the whole ""SkyTeam seamless travel"" ad campaign is an absolute joke. My platinum status did nothing to upgrade me to the Premium Economy seats though it is supposed to - at check-in AF said I could only upgrade for a fee. When I asked to speak to a supervisor the story changed and ""all the Premium Economy seats are already taken but if not we would of course upgrade you."" Getting on the flight 3 out of 27 Premium Economy seat were occupied. I politely asked the head steward if under the circumstances I could take a PE seat and he gruffly said that I should have asked on the ground - it was impossible to ever upgrade passengers once on board! No one is actually bad they just don't care and have learned that they can fob off any complaint. Flight attendants do an adequate job of serving dinner then you don't see them again the food on board is also adequate economy seats are expectedly uncomfortable IFE screens tiny. The best thing about AF are the CDG lounges. The worst thing is the uselessness of working to get status on SkyTeam when partners can be utterly arbitrary in honoring its benefits."
2840,Flew from London City Airport to Brest on 20th August Flight AF5291 and returned on 27th August Flight AF5290. Having arrived 2 hours before my flight at London City Airport and being second in the queue at check-in I was told I was being put on stand-by as Air France were not sure how much luggage they would be able to carry. I was told to go away and return 40 minutes before my flight and that I may have to divert to Paris or stay in a hotel at City Airport overnight. Being an elderly person travelling on my own I was concerned by this and this was not helped by the attitude of the Air France staff. Having booked my ticket 6 weeks ago and arriving in plenty of time before check-in I feel that this was totally unacceptable. I will certainly not be travelling with Air France until they improve their service and their attitude towards their customers.
2841,Flying from Atlanta to Paris CDG in Economy. We were held on the runway at Atlanta due to thunderstorms. Not the fault of AF but where were the crew? It was stiflingly hot but no sign of water. The menu looked good but the meal was abysmal. The champagne aperitif turned out to be a choice of a long opened bottle of fizz or a plastic bottle of vin de table. Miserable staff who then disappeared until offering a low grade snack before landing.
2842,Brussels to CDG and CDG to Narita in First Class on Aug 2nd 2013. I had booked in business but upgraded. Boarded a train in Brussels allowed to wait in Thalys lounge comfortable but basic no service on the train but luggage handed over and rather short trip of 75 minutes in first class. Collect luggage on the platform in CDG pretty quick an AF staff member welcomed us on the platform. Small waiting lounge while our luggage was checked in accompanied through priority immigration and security line then to the First class lounge. Accompanied and driven by car to the plane and introduced to the crew on A380. A nice female attendant took good care of us all through the flight very professional a quick lunch (just a main course and light sweet as I had eaten in the lounge). After lunch I changed into the pyjamas offered coming back to my seat the FA had turned it into a bed with mattress soft pillow and comfortable quilt. Nice breakfast of apple pancakes and tea. After landing first to disembark welcomed by AF staff priority lane for immigration and by the time we entered luggage hall our case had already been collected by another AF staff waiting for us with a luggage cart. All in all a very good experience.
2843,Business Class from MUR to Paris. Usual great service. Clean A340. Crew very pleasant and smiling. Wines and food was ok. Seats aren't the most modern but plenty of space and very comfortable. Left on time and arrived 10 mins late. This is a late flight so they quickly serve dinner then close cabin down for the night.
2844,Paris-Mauritius-Paris Economy on A340's. Poor service on both flights. Seats very uncomfortable they seem to tilt forward and have limited space. Food OK but drinks service appalling. 1 trolley service and 1 round of soft drinks for 11 hr flight! If you wanted more drinks you had to go to the galley at the back to help yourself where the flight attendants were sitting chatting/reading or putting on their makeup! If you are a Mauritian national though you are very well looked after personal food & drinks served and bottles of wine given to take home! Will never fly them again.
2845,MRU-MEL-SYD - A340. Service on board was very good however a couple of announcements could have been made by staff prior to boarding in Mauritius warning Sydney passengers in transit that their duty free spirits purchased in Mauritius would be confiscated by security staff upon arrival at Melbourne airport. The onus is on the Airline to warn its passengers that only a limited amount of liquid would pass security requirements at the second check point. This problem occurs quite often and results in quite an unnecessary loss of revenue to passengers unaware of this legal requirement.
2846,MRU-CDG. Business. One of the newest A340. Excellent service staff was very helpful and pleasant. If the seats would be at 180 that would be great. Keep on the good job.
2847,Flight AI-380 from DEL-SIN on 3 Nov 2012. Slightly delayed for about half an hour. This time the aircraft comes with personal screen on each seat though limited in choice. FA's were attentive with call button being responded to promptly. Seat was comfortable and I managed to sleep for few hours. Arrived in Changi earlier than scheduled. Highly recommend this airline.
2848,Flight AI-381 from SIN-DEL on 27 Oct 2012. Aircraft (A319) uses old Indian Airlines theme livery and arrived on time. Boarding was quick and well organised. Once onboard I found that no IFE available in this 5-hour flight so passengers were left without any entertainment except magazines and newspapers. Cabin crews were efficient however did not seem enthusiastic in interacting with passengers and hardly smiled. Call button answered promptly. My non vegetarian breakfast was tasty the crews performed one round of drinks after the meal and also one more prior to landing. In short a nice and acceptable flight.
2849,CDG to MAA (AI 142/B777LR) followed by a return trip MAA-CMB-MAA (AI 273/274- A321) then MAA to DEL (AI 430- B787 Dreamliner) and DEL to CDG (AI 143-B 777 LR). All flights on time check-in and embarkation monitored by cabin crews. All aircraft's clean modern and comfortable. Thanks to thin backseats the pitch seems larger than usual and to add to feeling of comfort the seats are equipped with footrests. Special mention to the Dreamliner brand new aircraft and serving several domestic destinations before entering service on international lines. The 'magic' stops here. No announcement given by captains. Average service from aircrews keeping a correct attitude and acting professionally. Food is below average both in quality and presentation. No menu given and on each flight almost the same choice of main course is proposed: vegetables or chicken with rice. Breakfast is very basic. All meals served in low quality plastic even picnic cutlery on long-haul you are afraid to break while using! Drinks are served before meals but take care as no drinks are served with meals (a mini bottle of mineral water comes in your plastic tray). AVOD delivers a basic but correct selection of classic and more recent movies Hollywood and Bollywood. All in all the AI product is simple the service minimum while acceptable as prices are on the low side. The food should really be improved and is not at the level one can expect from a flag carrier.
2850,Frankfurt to Windhoek and continuing onto Cape Town three days later - economy. Easy check in at Frankfurt and smooth boarding. Old plane but comfortable seating and pleasant food. No individual entertainment system - just the overhead screen. All staff very helpful and pleasant. Had special deal to upgrade on Windhoek to Cape Town flight for only $600 Namibian dollars. new plane with plenty of leg room and comfortable seat. Great service again. Pleasantly surprised all round and flights left on time arriving early in both cases. Recommended.
2851,My wife and I flew SW709 Windhoek - Cape Town on 3 June 2013 in Y/C. Brand new and spacious Airbus A319. Our flight can only be described as excellent! Extremely friendly and attentive crew full of fun and humour with passengers. Full service Dinner was a choice of 4 heated meals! Beef-Chicken-Fish or Vegetarian - very tasty. Flight attendants kept the wine freely flowing! Suggestions to their Cabin Services would be to change their brand of coffee (awful) and to issue disposable earphones to watch the in-flight drop-down movies instead of routing it through the PA system. All in all a great airline and a great crew flying the Spirit of Namibia.
2852,Service on board is not so bad but everyday you must fight with cancellations delays and unbelievable situations. Sometimes I fly domestically and generally they are not so bad but awful when I flew long haul WDH-FRA. In FRA after we checked baggage they announced the flight to WDH was delayed until the next day it was no possible to get your luggage back. SW paid hotel and dinner in a good hotel but airline service was very bad.
2853,I flew on 18/05/2013 from Cape Town to Windhoek and back on 26/05/2013. Was very surprised with the excellent service and overall great flying experience. The food was very good and although the tickets are a bit expensive for a 2 hour flight I still feel I got value for my money. The only thing Air Namibia should improve on is their in-flight entertainment.
2854,Paris to Washington (IAD) in economy on August 27. We had a pair of seats aisle + window with a convenient individual mini-storage bin by the window on top deck of Airbus A380. Extremely quiet and smooth flight. Aircraft very clean and in excellent shape. Reasonably comfortable seats with small footrest and excellent video/audio selection (wide music selection and at least 30 movies to chose from in a variety of languages). Departure delayed a few minutes due to a couple of passengers showing up late. Crew was pleasant and helpful. Food was average for economy. Open bar in the rear throughout the flight is a definite plus. All in all a good experience. Value for money was top by definition: frequent flyer award tickets earned in Delta FF program (yes FF tickets can be had even in high season at least when you book 9 months in advance).
2855,Flew with them back in February and March. One is ABZ-CDG. Another one is CDG-ZRH. Both are returned flight. Enjoy all the flight even there was nothing much to comment as they were all short flight. Check-in at Zurich was nice as the staffs checked through my baggage straight into ABZ even though I bought two separated tickets. Sandwiches snacks and drinks are offered onboard which were alright. There is not IFE. So can't comment on that. Would have been much better to get a proper meal for the price I've paid for. Overall satisfied with the airline and would fly them again.
2856,August 1st - Minnesota to Paris aboard AF 340-300 flight was great. Enjoyed the larger seats and more leg room food was average wine with and after dinner was good. The air-conditioning in the airplane was not working correctly so we sat on our blanket and pillows which offset the hardness of the seat. After dinner we were offered liquor flight attendants were friendly and accommodating. Since we departed at 8pm shortly after dinner the lights were turned off encouraging passengers to sleep or take advantage of the in screen entertainment. Screen size was exceptional big and easy to watch movie and TV selections were average. Breakfast was served about an hour before landing again the food was just average. Would fly AF Premium economy again absolutely so much better than economy.
2857,Just travelled to and from Mauritius in business class. Service was excellent. Nothing too much trouble for Cabin Crew. Very good comprehensive menu. Comfortable seats. Able to sleep comfortably both outward and inward journey. In flight entertainment a little limited. Otherwise very good.
2858,Johannesburg to Perth return. Service good seats comfortable. AVOD operated without any problems. The crew were friendly tasty food and wine is excellent. On our return schedules changed without notification however Air Mauritius covered all costs.
2859,London-Mauritius-London with A340-300. Check in: friendly and helpful staff trying to accommodate seat requests. Seats uncomfortable and tiny leg space (I am 1.90 m) but managed to sleep somehow. Food ok nothing special staff go round frequently with wine and water during flight. Entertainment limited few selection of films which are shown in unpredictable loops Aircraft needs upgrade to more comfortable seats they must be reading these reviews as most flaws mentioned not noticed (ie. patronising staff no child menu no water etc.)
2860,Mumbai (BOM) to Mangalore (IXB). A321 was clean full lots of leg room even in economy section. Food served even on 55 mins flight good entertainment options and all at a good ticket price. If all AI flights are as good I look forward to flying them again.
2861,DEL-ATQ Economy class on A321. Short but pleasant flight. Smiling FAs. Nothing much to complain.
2862,AI381 SIN-DEL delayed two hours due to a late inbound flight (but notification email sent under three hours before scheduled departure by which time I was already en route to Changi). An unaccommodating seat in a dated (if less than half-full) A320 was only marginally less disappointing than a breakfast service at which I was offered Fanta owing to a lack of regular juices. Given the low occupancy rate one might have expected service to have been more prompt and attentive. Instead the boisterous cabin crew decided to occupy the empty rows towards the rear and chatter amongst themselves while the passengers were left without IFE in a dimmed cabin. What you pay for is what you get.
2863,Flew Frankfurt to Windhoek on 1.11.12 and return on 11.11.12. Outward journey a little delayed due to mandatory inspection return journey on time. Big comfortable Airbus 340 food quite pleasant and flight attendants efficient if a little unsmiling. Entertainment not much good but no problem on a night flight.
2864,A319 WDH-JNB. Friendly cabin crew flying time just 1hr 35min yet a 4 course meal served with drinks and 3 choices of main course was served - however food of dubious quality with bland taste. Captain kept passengers informed about storms en route - all in all not a bad experience.
2865,I have flown this airline three times in the last three months. The flight was delayed every time. In total I have been in the air with this airline for six hours and delayed for 7 hours. Those who fly regularly from Windhoek know that this airline is unreliable. I do not recommend this airline to anyone who has connecting flights scheduled commitments or who do not have the mental stamina to endure wasted time or being treated with disregard. The ratings are deceiving because even though the general services are fair I would forego food and drink to been time.
2866,I flew from Victoria Falls to Windhoek and from Windhoek to Gaborone. Both flights were on ERJ135 planes. Actually it turned out to be the same plane and piloted by the same woman pilot. Both flights were on time and were only half-full. The single cabin crew served a small meal during the short 1.5 hour flights. All very relaxed and very adequate.
2867,August 21st Paris to Minnesota aboard AF 340-300. Flight delayed an hour because of a problem with the air- conditioning. Once again we enjoyed the larger seat and extra leg room. I especially like the option which allowed me to raise the seat front to support my calves. When dinner was served; my choice of chicken was quite good while my husbands choice of risotto was not good at all. Flight departed at 1.50 pm the lights were dimmed after dinner to enable passengers to get some rest. Attendants came through 3 or 4 times offering snacks and ice cream as well as additional drinks. The entertainment options were exactly the same offered on our previous flight. Once again we did not need the blankets so we sat on them which compensated for the hardness of the seats. My only complaint is the handling of our luggage. One of the advertised benefits of booking and paying for premium economy is to have your bags tagged priority??which is supposed to insure prompt delivering upon arrival. As I stated our flight was an hour late departing therefore we only had 45 minutes to make our connection in Minnesota. We were traveling with friends who did not opt for premium economy. We both checked in at the same time. Upon arriving in Minnesota our bags which were tagged priority were definitely not delivered in a timely manner. In fact many non priority bags arrived long before ours; including those belonging to our friends to flew economy. As a result we barely made our connection (2 minutes) our bags did not.
2868,CDG-VIE took this morning flight and it's so disappointing to see the standards drop so low. For breakfast if you don't drink Tea of Coffee it's Bread (croissant) and water no juice of any kind. Crew look suitably embarrassed. And you have for the inflight entertainment the reading of their Air France magazine. The paper cup and napkin is collected in a rubbish bag very quickly after serving and then the crew disappear. Virtually a low cost company.
2869,Frankfurt to Clermont Ferrand - connecting in Paris with both segments on Air France. Connection requires you to switch from terminal 2F to 2G in Paris which involves exiting the airport taking a shuttle and going through security again. My first flight was slightly late as a result I got to the gate 10 mins before departure. They refused to let me on supposedly they close the doors 10 mins before departure. Granted I am a frequent flier the flight probably does not have more than 2 dozen people on it I was already checked in and on my way from the other terminal. You would have thought they would make an effort. Unfortunately that's a recurring problem and since they have a monopoly on flights to smaller French airports like Clermont Ferrand they could not care less about what people think. I absolutely do not recommend this airline to anyone. Very high prices terrible service no consideration for customers. If you can avoid it I recommend you do so.
2870,"Auckland to Christchurch return on A320. Flight to Christchurch Koru Hour flight meaning alcoholic beverages and Cheese and cracker or vegetable crisps served. Bags out quickly at Christchurch. Flight to Auckland biscuits or vegetable crisps served along with tea/coffee or water. Bags out after 25 minutes. Seat room pretty good. However for the very tall, could be issue. Flight fast lasting about an hour in both directions. Seated in 23F and 23A respectively. Good value flight for the duration."
2871,LHR - MRU return in economy. Alitalia check in staff at LHR very friendly and helpful. The flight was on a tatty A340-300. The material was coming off the backs of the seats and the inflight entertainment did not work properly. When it did work it had a very limited selection of music and films. The seats were very uncomfortable seat pitch the smallest I have experienced on a long haul flight. The food was fine. The cabin crew were very polite and friendly though forget pressing the call bell as they won't bother coming. If you want something you have to go to the rear galley and get it yourself.
2872,"LHR-MRU in economy on a very tatty A340. The backs of the seats were coming apart to the point where you could see metal seats incredibly hard and uncomfortable and seat pitch so small that I had to sit side saddle for the entire flight. No chance of getting sleep in these seats. IFE didn't work properly and there are very few films or music to listen to - certainly not enough selection for a 12hr flight. Flight attendants friendly and polite and food was fine. Toilets don't appear to be cleaned during the flight so quite disgusting on a 12 hr flight. MRU-LHR in economy was similar. Boarding at MRU a mess. The queue from the gate weaved its way across most of the tiny terminal and was being processed very slowly. A lot of passengers getting angry. Flight attendants operated a ""self-service"" from the rear galley. The flight attendant call bell seems to be purely for decorative purposes so there was an endless line of passengers going to and from the rear galley."
2873,Paris CDG to Mauritius in Economy Class and totally disappointed. Firstly the seats were so uncomfortable it was impossible to sleep. There was no in flight entertainment because it was such an old aircraft - we did have our own tiny screens but they only displayed a map of where we were! The staff were okay and food about edible. Fly with another airline you will not regret it.
2874,CPT-MRU A319 Business Class. Fixed cabin of 16 seats (2-2) but 3-3 with the centre seat as a table. Good leg room for a regional flight although 5 hrs is a long time in a economy seat which it appears to be. It has an IFE box under the centre seat. Cabin service was good and food excellent - a 4 course lunch with a choice of 3 mains. Aircraft - one of only two of this type operate mainly MRU to South Africa. Overall good but a poor seat. Arrived on time but parked remote - seems standard for this type and after some delay disembarked onto a bus.
2875,LHR-MRU Economy flight delayed by one hour. Seats uncomfortable but size okay. Skipped dinner. Breakfast was really basic with near frozen pastry and bread. For an economy flight it was basic service nothing to be impressed. Crew did their jobs but that was it. IFE okay for a night flight.
2876,Flew AI 771 - CCU-BLR. Aircraft deployed was an A319 with IFE. Though IFE did not function the flight left 30 minutes ahead of schedule and arrived 40 minutes ahead of schedule. Service was good and they served a full fledged dinner meal which was of good quality. Flight attendants courteous though they need to be more attentive. Will definitely recommend.
2877,14th September 2012 from Bangkok to London with a stop over in Delhi. First leg of the trip was a 4.5hour journey to Delhi and was the worst flight I have taken. After sitting down I realised my TV was not working I asked the flight attendant if this would rectify itself on take off and he told me to 'sit down and wait'. After take off my TV started up and I could only watch one English film which was half way through probably from the flight before. We landed in Delhi and after two hours boarded a better plane with bigger seats and bigger TV screens. The inflight entertainment was average but I could cope with that rude and lazy flight attendants I cannot. Not long after take off the trays of food come round. The curry was really nice shame the lady serving me was the complete opposite. After my meal I waited 20 minutes for a flight attendant when I wanted a drink after another 10-20minutes I got up and went to ask for a red wine. Who pays Â£700 for a long haul flight and has to serve themselves? The remainder of the flight was the same. 9.5hours with no flight attendants no-one answering the flight attendant button. Unfortunately I have to fly back to Bangkok with Air India.
2878,BKK-DEL segment. There was only 3 of us in Business class. The cabin looked tired food was sub par No drinks were offered and the entertainment system didn't work. There was 2 other flight attendants in the business class who didn't bother to step out they only did when they needed to get to their luggage to transfer some personal belongings. They then left the luggage on the floor for the duration of the flight as well as when landing. I flew from US on Asiana business class and Air India management/flight attendants could learn from them as to how customer service is supposed to be performed.
2879,Windhoek-Cape Town. Brand new 319. Excellent seats. Very friendly staff at check-in. Confusion at boarding when the sign at the gate showed wrong departure but all in all a great experience.
2880,Windhoek to Cape Town (just under 2 hours) and were quite surprised. Check-in was quick and efficient although the lounge at Windhoek is so-so (staff friendliness could be much better). Warmly welcomed onboard by the purser and were surprised to see business class seats with such a large pitch! Flight departed on time breakfast served was excellent and service throughout always with a smile.
2881,CPT-WHK and WHK-CPT. Brand new A319 with plenty of legroom. Comfortable seats and friendly FA's. Seats were comfortable and the cabin layout good.
2882,JNB-LUN. Flight left on time old plane but comfortable food was insipid flight attendants friendly but too much chatter amongst themselves. All in all an average flight. My problems started when I wanted to reschedule my return flight. Air Namibia office at Joburg airport could not help eventually had to purchase a return ticket on SAA to get back to Joburg in July and 5 months later I am still struggling to rebook my return to Joburg on the valid return leg I still hold with Air Namibia.
2883,I travel between CPT and WHK and haven't been on a single flight that's departed on time. The interior is old fashioned but quite comfortable and the FA's pleasant but without much effort at service. I will continue to fly Air Namibia between Cape Town and Windhoek.
2884,Return trip Hong Kong to Paris. Outbound flight was delayed 1.5 hours but landed close to on time. Seat was hard but putting your pillow and blanket underneath you helps. I prefer normal recliner seats to the Air France shell seats as the recline is minimal. Food was reasonable and staff service was much warmer on the return flight.
2885,Singapore to Paris return. Arrived at Singapore airport and read an email saying my family of 5 had been bumped and told to come back the next day. After speaking/begging with a very helpful Air France rep we were put on a Singapore airlines flight leaving roughly the same time. Flight back from Paris to Singapore on an A380 was great excellent cabin staff who were extremely pleasant and helpful with my young children food was good plenty of drinks entertainment was a bit limited for adults but the kids loved it. Overall preferred the Air France flight home more than our unexpected Singapore airlines flight over.
2886,CDG-Dusseldorf. Check in was quick with the machine and involved zero interaction with staff. Lounge was basic but I guess it is normal since they have only European flights from Terminal 2F. Boarding as usual is chaotic but Priority boarding announcement was still made less than a minute before general boarding was called. Once on board fantastic friendly and elegant purser welcomed and greeted passengers. For the price of the ticket the catering was awful with cold tasteless amuse bouche served. Seats are all the same across all cabins with 2 rows of business class (2 passengers sharing 3 seats) and a row of premium economy class (3 passengers on 3 seats) then a curtain separating economy class which gives an extremely cramped and stressful feeling. The cabin crew did their best but honestly the hard product let everything down.
2887,3 hour hop across Tasman left on time and arrived ahead of time. Meal served plus drinks water and coffee. Flight crew excellent always available and friendly during service. Entertainment has loads of offerings and choices.
2888,After delayed arrival of connecting inbound flight it was always going to be a rush to catch Air NZ flight in Melbourne but Air NZ made sure all connecting passengers were on board before departure. Service was fine and a meal offered and drinks. Lots of movies and shows to watch for 3 hour hop across Tasman arriving on time back in Christchurch. It was always going to be a struggle and none of the delayed passengers luggage made the connection so remained in Melbourne. It is moments like this that AIR NZ customer service comes to the front and you can see why they look after their passengers. Details were taken and arrangements made with bags placed on the next flight arriving in late at night. Air NZ called first thing to advise bags had arrived and would be delivered that morning by van. Don't blame Air NZ for bags missing flight and the efforts to make sure the delay was kept to a minimum was good.
2889,It had been some time since I used this airline and I did so with hesitation as I had had bad experiences in the past. I now regret giving them another chance as I had another bad experience. Check-in was fine and boarding prompt if mechanical. The seats were shockingly narrow. The catering was OK but a far cry from experiences on Asian rivals and certain European airlines for that matter. The cabin crew were efficient enough but robotic in many respects. After such a long flight I was tired and very uncomfortable. In the good old days Air New Zealand used a wonderful Boeing 747 on this route and had a generous baggage allowance. Time have changed and not for the better either. I will not use this airline again!
2890,MRU-MEL on A340. Disinterested check-in clerk couldn't have cared less about my seating preferences even though what I wanted was available. Could not read as an alternative to the non-on demand video because the light switch was incorrectly wired to illuminate the seat next to mine. Flight attendants nice enough but take a water bottle on board - they make no effort to carry water or juice along the aisles when the cabin lights are down. If you aren't in an aisle seat presumably you are just expected to dehydrate unless you climb over your sleeping fellow travellers to get to the galley. Food ordinary. No reason to fly this airline unless route dictates worth rescheduling to avoid.
2891,MRU-MXP return Business. Flight delayed by 6 hours then another 6 hours. Being local we went back home and returned. Skipped dinner and went to sleep as soon as we took off. Staff very helpful. Return leg was night flight good sleep crew was excellent. Only set back is the seat at an angle not the best. Milan lounge is not really a lounge.
2892,Seats on the Heathrow to Mauritius flight were hard provided no lumbar support and very uncomfortable. Some members of staff somewhat patronising and not very helpful. Headphone did not work and the food was awful. They do not serve the small bottles of wine and we were served tiny amounts of wine in plastic glasses I felt we were treated like children. When asked for two small glasses we were very patronisingly told that we have to wait for the next trolley - which was going to be a long time after the meal. My partner and I ordered vegetarian food and were served very small portions of very unappetising food and a fruit salad with acidic and unripe fruits. The next morning we were offered two small cold soft and doughy buns with margarine and jam. Not a pleasant trip.
2893,Heathrow to Mauritius seats are very tight spaced. Staff quite unhelpful. In such a long haul flight they did not distribute water or juice after meal times nor did they advise passengers to help themselves with drinks in the catering area. I travelled with 18 month old twins - staff unhelpful and gave our kids meals with adults meals whilst distributing other kids meals earlier. Mauritius to Heathrow staff rude and spoke over our heads literally bitching about kids playing on the floor between passenger seats. They lack manners and customer service. Staff have no compassion and empathy for parents who travel with kids - they behave as if they are doing us favours whilst we pay in full for adult and kid fares.
2894,I flew LHR-DEL-LHR and this was my first AI experience. Overall I would say it wasn't bad but it could easily be so much more better. Check-ins both in London and Delhi were smooth and easy. On Board service and facilities lets it down. The staff even though well meaning are not interested. They simply did their three rounds (1 round of drinks and 2 of meals) and no more. On both flights the service call bell was not attended to even though I must have pressed it for at least 10 mins before giving up and getting up! On the LHR-DEL flight I did not complain about it but when I enquired on the DEL-LHR flight about why they did not attend to the service call they could not find it on the system. Most airlines if not all come and collect the rubbish the headsets etc simple clearing up tasks which weren't performed by AI staff.
2895,LHR-DEL-BKK return. First leg to Delhi (777-3ER) in the night dinner was served as well as breakfast both delicious. Flight attendants happy to help Delhi T3 is clean and modern and the transit was smooth. Second flight A321 with inflight entertainment! Again a meal and flight attendants happy to help. Return flights seemed to be even better Delhi transit again smooth meals were great small delay to LHR due to congestion at DEL but made up for it. Flight attendants were polite and again helpful. 773ER inflight entertainment is great though a little bit hit and miss! No issues with baggage would recommend.
2896,"BOM-BLR and DEL-MUM in Economy Class. Aircraft was clean with inflight entertainment leg space was excellent seats comfortable. Both flights left on time and arrive before schedule. Flight attendants were pleasant and polite. Indian food served on both sectors was good and filling. Online Check in both sectors so did not have to queue up at the Airport. Kiosk check in also available at both airports. The Captain mentioned its a ""New and Improved Air India"" and I agree with him."
2897,I fly with Air Namibia quite a lot and must say that usually I'm very happy with all. That's the reason I decided to comment here is yes sometimes there are delays but show me any airline that doesn't have that problem. Flew from Johannesburg-Windhoek. Flight wasn't that full and boarding went quickly and the flight left on time. Plane was an older B737-200 but looked in top condition and also the interior of the plane was really good. The on flight service was very good and I need to mention that the food served on Air Namibia is usually quite good compared to other mayor airlines. The plane doesn't have onboard entertainment but with a good monthly on flight magazine the 2 hrs flight is over in a breeze.
2898,Windhoek-Frankfurt-Windhoek. Service ok but FA's disappeared after dinner service. Even pressing the call button did nothing. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was embarrassing. A dry bun with a piece of ham and lettuce or tuna mayo and yoghurt. All around you saw people eating a few bites and leaving the rest. Seat was okay but IFE was a joke. For a 10 hour flight I would think you would have more of a choice than 1 movie played on 3 small screens in economy class. I sat in row 22 which was 4 rows from the screen and even by squinting I still could not see it clearly. Must be a nightmare for families travelling with smaller kids. I could have paid the same for a Lufthansa flight from J'burg with an additional R3000 for a return flight between Windhoek and J'Burg. Will do that next time.
2899,"Checking in at 06:00 in Cape Town along with my husband and 20 month old baby for our flight back to Whk at 0800 we were casually informed that our plane was ""inserviceble"" and would hopefully be ready for departure at 10:00. Needless to say that did not happen and we departed at 1800 that evening without much of an explanation or apology. My husband dared his next venture with Air Namibia on 21 March and was casually informed 5hours before his flight that it was cancelled but had been re-booked on a SAL flight to be booked in within 2 hours (which turned out not to be true after confirming the booking with SAL ourselves). We live 500km away from Whk and cannot be on standby to be ready for their flight changes as it suits them! We have always been regular travelers with Air Namibia but unfortunately it seems not to be safe anymore to rely on their ""unserviceable"" planes or their inconsiderate service."
2900,FRA-WDH-FRA business class. Found service ok but nothing special especially because these are night flights and FAs tend to disappear after meal service - nonchalant and indifferent service. Meal was acceptable portions relatively small but no effort to serve anything interesting or local flavors. Seat is old-style cradle seat but good room between rows and sufficient recline if you sleep sideways. Plane dates from the mid-90's but in OK shape. Be prepared to walk to/from terminal upon arrival and departure from Windhoek. Boarding in WDH is chaotic. Overall fares too high for the product/service they provide and would opt for BA instead via JNB.
2901,JNB-Windhoek - although plane not full it did seem cramped. Short flight but the crew worked to get round to everyone some of the crew friendly others less so. Main concern was on taking off several items within the cabin fell off - cover for an emergency exit 2 overhead storage cabins opened and the crew seemed to think this was normal and just refixed the items and carried on. Food was good though and seemed very cheap compared to SAA.
2902,ATL-CDG 7/13/13 B777-300. Take off and landing on time etc. Nothing special or terrible to report. I thought the business class on Air France although not bad is also not good. Seats recline OK but not especially comfortable. The 3 across the middle of business class seems outdated to me these days. The food was terrible for business class. Terrible fish horrible cheese wine selection OK. Overall no reason to compliment or complain and given the ticket price I think I was just about getting value for money.
2903,Upon checking in at Bangkok I was told I would have to pay $100 US for an a second checked in bag despite only having 20 kilos. I have travelled on international flights for 35 years and have never heard of this policy. When I requested an emergency exit seat as I am over 6 ft 3 I was told all these seats were taken and anyway they cost 70 Euros extra. On boarding I observed 2 empty emergency exit seats. Finally I was dismayed at the on-board food they served and expected a lot more from their national carrier from a country that supposedly has some of the best cuisine in the world. I could not eat the food as it was stale and tasteless. All I could stomach on a 14 hour flight was a very small ham roll. Never again Air France.
2904,Arrived at CDG 3 hours before flight with my young daughter to be told that our flight home was overbooked and that this wasn't unusual as Air France overbook all of their flights. We were handed standby by boarding cards and 3 hours later at 9pm it was confirmed that we wouldn't be able to board the plane by the most bored looking ill mannered unhelpful and unsympathetic customer service representative I have ever encountered. We were eventually taken elsewhere and issued with a voucher for a hotel and meal. We were vaguely pointed in the direction we needed to travel and told that with children it would take about 45 minutes to get across the airport to the hotel shuttle bus stop. After a torturous trek across the airport we eventually got to the bus stop and then to our hotel so late that the restaurant had long since closed and the only food available was from a vending machine.
2905,"I do five return trips from NZ to N America and usually one to Europe. I usually seek out the older aircraft with the more comfortable 3-3-3 seating on which I usually sleep at least six hours in an aisle seat. This time however was different. On the new 10 abreast B777 with the narrow seats, armrests and aisles. My usual aisle seat was most uncomfortable. It seems that the corporate policy is to strip the dignity of the majority of the passengers in order to promote higher profits up front. I am now considering having window seats but wearing nappies which would be more dignified - I look forward to more competition on these routes."
2906,"LAX to AKL. This was a superb flight thanks to a professional crew and modern aircraft. Meal choices of a high standard. There was a choice of snacks and drinks available, and staff available throughout the flight. The mattress on the lie flat bed makes a difference."
2907,"Two wonderful flights with engaging and helpful crews. Check in agent a little off hand and only issued connecting boarding pass for one of us. LAX Star Alliance lounge run by Air NZ much more pleasant then the old T2 lounge, NZ 5 flight left on time, meals and wines excellent. Slept very well. Connected with NZ 135 also left on time and Auckland lounge was good, food better that usual for breakfast although didn't need more than a snack. Flight to Brisbane equally competent. IFE on both excellent choice although only had the new system on NZ 5 which is a vast improvement on the old one. Bags off promptly and out of the airport in 15 minutes."
2908,Frankfurt to Mauritius and back last week. First we booked a non-stop flight the ticket said that too but in fact the plane - after already delayed for over an hour - stopped in Geneva and we had to go out there and wait for another hour. The plane was old  legroom in was poor due to the IFE Box mentioned in other reviews. The staff was friendly but never there. I've hardly seen them during the flight and helped myself for drinks (so far there were drinks). Only the food was ok and the entertainment program was nice.
2909,DUR-MRU return Business class on A319. Things work so well from the Durban side but I have flown DUR-MRU-HKG return and JNB-MRU-LHR and by comparison the cabin crew this time barely managed a smile unless you grovelled. I don't expect to be glared at for asking for more bread. The return leg was pretty similar as far as staff went. Clearly nicer staff get to fly the longer routes. The most severe criticism I would make is the boarding leaving Mauritius. It is unjustifiable to leave long lines of passengers waiting for over an hour with no info nor telling us to all go sit down again. They knew perfectly well that they were running a full hour late as they later came up with the excuse that the plane was running late from Rodrigues! They pay lip service to priority boarding of business class passengers. Suddenly they announced a gate change so everyone had to scramble to change gates. Kept us waiting on the tarmac for the bus. What is the most appalling is that they kept 5 medical patients who were flying on the flight in wheelchairs waiting too in the line with no explanation to them.
2910,Mauritius-Singapore return Economy new A330 both legs. Seats quite hard but 7 hours flight is sustainable. I no longer rely on the IFE and always bring my IPAD. Flight was quite full but had no one seating to me on both legs and that is a major relief. Crew was performing basic service and not very friendly. The male staffs were more interested in female passengers. Come on MK you can do better!
2911,VTZ-ATQ via New Delhi. Flight from VTZ departed 1.5 hours late and barely had 15 minutes for the transit at the IGI Airport but the ground crew at the Delhi airport was quite helpful and we reached the gate on time. Flight from Delhi departed on time but was an A321 instead of the usual B 777-300er. The food on the first leg of the flight was average a standard hot South Indian meal and the food on the second leg was a packet of peanuts and bottled juice could have been better for an hour long flight. Cabin crews were helpful and courteous. IFE system had a good selection of Bollywood and Hollywood flicks. Overall a good flight experience have been flying Air India and will continue to.
2912,I flew Air India YYZ-DEL in First Class. The seat was very comfortable - I had no trouble getting to sleep. The in-flight entertainment was also good - very nice choice of movies and TV shows. The cabin crew were very attentive and responded quickly to every need of mine. The meal which they served with great pride looked and tasted excellent. The only downside was the lounge - poor quality compared to the rest of the experience The aircraft looked very modern and clean. Flight was on time. I would not hesitate to fly AI again.
2913,Flew from Pune to Frankfurt via Delhi. Aircraft was clean legroom and food was good entertainment was ok (not enough English options). Terminal in Delhi is very nice. Transfer experience is good. Good value for money.
2914,FRA-WDH-JHB return. The main reason for choosing Air Namibia was their low price and (for us) convenient flight dates. Online check in worked pretty good and we could choose our seat for the intercontinental flights. Planes were in good condition seats a bit old and not too comfortable. Entertainment was pretty bad just a few screens for all passengers with horrible quality and uninteresting videos. Cabin crew was okay some of them more friendly and helpful than others. Same with the food nothing special but nothing wrong with it either. Overall my experience was quite good. You get what you pay for they don't excel at anything but nothing is very bad either.
2915,FRA-WDH. Service is not great they are just doing their job that's it. The seats are of the old angle lie type still in good condition but nowhere near to the newest generation. The video system is a shame as not on demand and very limited choice. They started the movie before the meal was served my screen was out of order. I mentioned it but they could not or did not try anything to fix it.We chose Air Namibia only because of the direct flight. If you do not mind having connections fly with South African.
2916,CPT-WVB-WDH-FRA Business class. Check-In at CPT was a total chaos. Air Namibia ground handling agents didn't bother to put airline logo destination etc on the screens above the counters - we had to ask if they had a dedicated Business Class check-in-counter and which one it was. Queuing up there didn't save us plenty of time though since they worked almost in slow- motion. Aircraft on Cape Town-Windhoek flight was a B737-200 built in the early 70s but in relatively good condition. Huge old-fashioned business class seats. Service very friendly and attentive - for Air Namibia standards even excellent. Our flight to Windhoek wasn't nonstop but landed in the beautiful desert airport of Walvisbay where they let some passengers get off and others get on the plane for the last remaining 30 minutes of the flight to Windhoek. This stopover lasted no longer than 25 mins. We had left Cape town with half an hour delay but managed to arrive in Windhoek only 15 minutes behind schedule. Lounge in Windhoek is small packed with passengers waiting for the Frankfurt flight. WDH-FRA their last remaining intercontinental route is flown with A340-300 (bought from Lufthansa). Business class is comparable to LH or BA of 15 years ago. Old style cradle seats no lie-flats. IFE in armrest as personal TV but only a small selection of movies. Food edible (dinner had 3 main course options breakfast either hot omelette or cold cuts) wines were delicious. Toilets clean small amenity kit was provided. I had 3-4 hours sleep. Their business class can't compare with major airlines but Air Namibia does the job. Their prices are reasonable.
2917,"Frankfurt-Windhoek-Cape Town return. The flights were on time and check-in boarding etc. was professional. The price was reasonable compared to other airlines at time of booking. First impression well maintained A340-300 exterior wise with a slightly run down cabin interior. Old and uncomfortable seats good leg room. A340 only had ""old fashioned"" television sets above the middle section of the cabin. One projector screen at the front of the cabin section and 2 television sets for the rest of the cabin. One criticism of the IFE is that the main feature starts well in to the flight when most people would like to sleep. The meals were average to poor there were no heated rolls and main course did not taste of anything. Cold breakfast only. Their bar service closed after the duty free service ""due to customs regulations"" something which sounds like a cover for cost cutting. They could have at least offered drinks for sale. This was though not the worst issue with Air Namibia. I would say their flight attendants have a long way to go if they would like to compare themselves to professional airlines. The flight attendants FRA-WDH were grumpy to the point where I would say downright rude. They did not attend to passenger needs in any ways and seemed to want to get over and done with the job. I was personally accused of credit card fraud when I purchased duty free products on-board as my signature apparently did not correspond. (I understand the problem of fraud on many African flights but she had my passport and a credit card with a picture of me in her hand. What else do Air Namibia need?) The way she expressed this was also very accusing. The crew never smiled once and we just felt we were in the way for them. The other three flights were slightly better but I wouldnÂ´t go as far as to say they have attended a smiling or service course. I would say fly Air Namibia only if youÂ´re actually going to Windhoek and want to fly direct or their offer is really good compared to the alternatives. I will gladly pay more for another airline next time."
2918,CPH-CDG-MIA / JFK-CDG-CPH. I upgraded to Business class on the CDG-MIA flight operated by an ageing 747-400 but everything worked just fine cabin was clean and seat comfortable. JFK-CDG was an A380-800 aircraft. We had a delay of almost 2 hours on departure from JFK due to ATC but captain kept us informed and was very apologetic. In general food was good but it could be better. Flight attendants were outstanding especially on both long haul flights they were just some of the best I have ever had. The worst was that I missed my connection at CDG and the customer service agent wanted me to wait for 6 hours when there was an available flight 1.5 hours after our late arrival. Overall very satisfied with AF. Chapeau to its cabin crew!
2919,We flew from Venice to Paris and will connect from Paris to HKG. Flight from Venice to Paris was 10 mins late and the flight to HKG left. Next available flight is 24 hour after. Customer service staff were rude and unfriendly. We requested to have seat upgrade due to 24 hour delay and our request was rejected. At the airport we requested lounge access and they still declined request. In addition seats are horrible and your back hurts after a 12-hour flight. Food was cold.
2920,SFO-BLR (SFO-CDG-BLR) this week. Flight departure delayed by 13+ hours due to technical problem. We were literally waiting in Paris Airport almost for 16 hours and we were neither given accommodation nor not alternative flight.
2921,IAH-CDG-SVO. Both flights late. Catering good and onboard staff friendly. Seats not up to specs for business class especially CDG-SVO where the legroom is smaller than in some competitor economy cabins. CDG-SVO delayed 2hrs due to technical problem and then another 35 minutes for wrong catering being loading onboard. Overall below expectations and not fair value for money paid. Air France service has deteriorated in last years and the only positive is the cabin crew that does it's job with a sense of pleasure. CDG airport is a nightmare and a story on it's own.
2922,Again it was a joy to use the airlines Premium Economy cabin. It's a pity that other airlines do not follow Air New Zealand's lead in this product. The crew were brilliant as was the food. Will always choose this airline against others because of this product
2923,"Our initial flight was delayed by over 3 hours with very little explanation as to why. This meant that we missed our internal US connecting flight and had to spend the first night of our honeymoon bedded down at LAX airport. Because connecting flight was not packaged with ANZ, they were not in the slightest bit interested in helping us out. Complaint email took 6 days to get a response. When it came, it basically said 'tough'. Will never fly with them again and suggest anybody booked with them beware."
2924,"LON-MRU-LON in Business Class travelling with our baby daughter. I have to say the experience was very good indeed particularly on LON-MRU. The cabin crew in biz cabin were excellent attentive and polite. The food was of a good standard the sleeper beds (although not fully flat recline to an angle of 170 degrees) were comfortable - I am 6'3"" tall and could almost fully stretch out. Flights were on time outbound hours delay inbound. AVOD inflight entertainment system in biz class was good decent large screen in your armrest moderate selection of films to choose from. As a leisure airline Air Mauritius offered excellent value for money on this route compared to their only direct competitor (BA). Hold bags were priority tagged and did come off first at both ends. Our babies pushchair was also waiting at the aircraft door in both directions when we landed. Only slight let down is the Air Mauritius Lounge in MRU which is pretty poor and in need of a major makeover but a minor point in the overall travel experience."
2925,LHR to MRU return in September 2010 (both night time flights). Found the seats cramped and uncomfortable not all of the headset jacks worked. The Flambouant aircraft appears to be less tired than The Chamarel one both Airbus 340's. Staff were helpful and polite we also appreciated the cabin lights being turned off after dinner however due to the severe lack of padding in the seats my legs and posterior spent more time asleep than I did. We do recommend flying with Air Mauritius but not for such a long journey.
2926,Business Class (which was cheaper than I thought) in early September. No problems on the ground (though immigration at Mauritius a bit long winded) or in the air. Food wine and staff very good. Would have no hesitation in using them again.
2927,Heathrow - Mauritius return. Outbound flight was appalling. The legroom in economy is the worst we've experienced. As already mentioned in other reviews the IFE box is situated under the seats so severely eats into the already cramped conditions. Cabin staff were generally surly and rude. One stewardess rammed the beverage trolley into my husband twice and poured hot tea in his lap without acknowledgement let alone an apology. Headphones didn't work. Toilets where dirty. Inbound was a slight improvement. The cabin staff where pleasant.
2928,JFK-DEL-JFK on AI 101/102 in economy. I have taken this flight 4-5 times in the last 2 years sometimes continuing to CCU. It was always excellent. Relatively clean plane very good VOD good food. It was always on time no issue with baggage or check in. I am very well traveled and frequently fly on airlines like Emirates and BA. At least on these flight AI did compare with them positively. I have zero experience on AI on any other route though.
2929,I have to admit that based on the experience of my last three flights Air India domestic in economy is actually quite good. Leg room is much better than Indigo or Jet. Food is actually not bad and you do not have to pay for it. Having a working entertainment system is a plus. Some jet and kingfisher flights have the individual screens but nowadays these are never working. Flight attendants seem to be older on average but I find them polite and pleasant. The interiors are colourful in red yellow and orange. These last 3 flights were on time and really I have few complaints.
2930,My husband and I flew from Kathmandu Nepal to Varanasi. We boarded about 2 hours late and after keeping us inside the plane for 30 minutes they simply said that there was a problem with the engine and we had to get off (no apologies no explanations). They packed us into a run-down bus parked in front of the aircraft and without any further explanation we sat for 2 hours. Almost 4 hours after our departure time we were simply led back into the plane. Arrived 5 hours late in Varanasi. Staff attitude terrible.
2931,I had booked a return trip from LGW to WHK - about 2 weeks before my scheduled departure from Gatwick I stumbled across information (by chance!) on the internet that Air Namibia had axed all its flights from Gatwick. They never informed me of it at all (later I found out it was because I had booked directly with the airline on its website rather than with a travel agent. People who booked directly with the airline received no information apparently). So I phoned their representatives (who were still active in London). The agent who took my call was very helpful though - she rescheduled my flight without issues with BA via Frankfurt. She had also assured me that I could check my bags straight through from Heathrow to Windhoek. Of course this ended up not being the case. The lady at the BA counter at Heathrow knew of no such cooperation with Air Namibia. She said I had to re-check the bags in at Frankfurt. I didn't mind though. Otherwise my flights were on time and I got to Windhoek without any other hassle. The return journey was flawless - bags checked through all the way to Heathrow from Windhoek via Frankfurt. I would fly them again.
2932,"The flight from Cape Town South Africa to Windhoek Namibia in itself was pleasant. What was shocking was the bad service delivered at Cape Town airport when attempting to buy a ticket. I arrived at the airport to find that the Air Namibia office was closed within were the staff busy sorting things out. There was no sign indicating their hours so after having looked through the window I sat down on a bench outside the office. I must have sat there for about 15 minutes before some rude employee (I think she was the manager) opened the window and looked at me. Seeing as though she opened the window and was looking at me I proceeded to stand in front of her. She asked me very rudely ""What? Is there an emergency or something? It is our lunch break and you are bothering me."" I was well prepared to sit and wait for who knows how long as there was no sign indicating that they were indeed on a lunch break. I wanted to tell her to stick her ticket but it was the best one at the time. I have never experienced such bad service in my life."
2933,"WDH-FRA with my wife. Big mess to reconfirm the flights in WDH (computer breakdown) incompetent employees not willing to help. Checkin OK and quick very lousy lounge at WDH no priority boarding chaotic ""rush"" to the aircraft. Aircraft standing there the whole day and no traffic but able to depart 30 mins late. Worst cabin service ever experienced no meal choice available slow and incompetent staff. My wife went to the galley to ask gently for something to drink together with the meal the chief FA came to our seats and scold us ""you have to be patient we have other things to do"". Were treated like disobedient pupils no need to say after meal there was no more service and entertainment system at my seat was defective. Rude wake-up in the middle of the night 2.5 hours before landing for what they call a breakfast. Incredible and a great pity for the wonderful and friendly country of Namibia next time we fly again SAA despite of having to fly via JNB. We traveled last time in 2006 with Air Namibia and things have turned from good average to lousy."
2934,WDH-CPT. They offer more than european airlines on a 2 hrs Flight. Aperitif Service hot meal coffee tea etc. Very professional staff good information from cabin and flightdeck. Absolutely friendly.
2935,IAD to CDG continuing on to DUB. A380 upper deck 62F. Seat is nice when sitting but for sleeping it is just dreadful. Not flat the headrest is apparently made of marble so your head actually hurts when you use their flat pillow to sleep and heaven help you if you are in the window and your seatmate is sleeping. The pitch is far too skimpy for comfort. Food and beverages are fine - although I don't understand why you have precisely two hot meal choices on an A380. The amenity kit is poor. The service was surprisingly friendly and good on this flight - I will give them that. CDG is the predictable mess - delays lack of information and the busses to shuttle you to connections so loved by Euro airports. When you have other options that have flat seats (Delta BA Brussels etc) and don't have to go through CDG I can't fathom why I would continue to take AF. On the bright side it was better than the last time I flew.
2936,LCY-Nuremberg. City Jet owned by AF. Like using LCY as it's quieter classier than other airports. However disappointed with seat space and sandwich options on flight. On time. For return wanted to investigate changing flight. Ringing phone line from a mobile in Germany - god knows how much it has cost. Couldn't speak to anyone despite numerous tries. You actually get cut off if they decide too long a queue this happens after menu options so waste money and have to call later. Then when connected again held in a queue for 7 mins then gave up. Went online put details in you go round in circles on the website clicking modify flight etc this just to find the cost of changing. In the end rebooked with competitor.
2937,DEL-CDG-ZRH and back by Premium Economy in June-July 2013. Pros: 1) Priority access for check in (all airports) security (all except DEL) passport control (all except DEL) boarding (all airports). 2) Additional baggage allowance. 3) Comfortable seats with large screen good sized tray tables USB charging points at each seat. 4) Personal amenities kit given. 5) Business class seating (with meals) on short haul flights within Europe (CDG-ZRH) and back since there is no premium economy seating on these flights. Cons: 1) Have to use economy lavatories. 2) Cutlery is still plastic. Overall worth the little extra that you spend as compared to regular economy.
2938,My flight to Paris was cancelled after sitting at LAX yesterday for more than 3 hours. No explanation no attempt to help us get on another flight. It took me forever to get through to AF and rebook a flight for tomorrow. They were rude almost acting as if they were doing me a favor to rebook my flight. This is not my first bad experience. I will never fly AF again. Unfriendly cold and distant. Most of all terrible customer service.
2939,Los Angeles to Auckland Business class. Air NZ have a great business class product very comfortable seats and staff lay out the bed with a mattress topper. Good IFE and food pretty good. Best thing was the staff so friendly and seem to really enjoy their job compared to all the other airlines we use over the years. Nothing is too much trouble for them.
2940,"AKL-SIN in P/E. Overnight flight. Air NZ's P/E seats have varied over the past few years depending on aircraft type and routes. These former business-class-style leather seats are extremely comfortable. The only drawback is the footrest which is awkward. Main advantage in P/E is the legroom and space. Our view is that all seats should be like this. Economy cattle class now really is horrible. Air NZ's business class is superb but so much pricier. P/E is well worth the extra cost. If you are hesitating just try it. How nice to have a personal ""Kia ora"" message on your screen. Air NZ's safety video remains hmm quirky though some passengers now find it a little OTT and are fed up with the continued hyping of the Lord of the Rings movies. IFE was only adequate and offerings could have been more comprehensive. Food was excellent. It did seem unnecessary for the FAs to have to make two separate trips to serve up appetizers and main courses when one excursion would have sufficed. Not really a fan of overnight flights if arriving early in the morning (not the case if flying the other direction) as you have to wait hours to get into your hotel. I only doze or sleep an hour or so on flights. We had traveled to Auckland from Christchurch. A direct SQ flight in P/E when/if available (scheduled for September 2015) would be worth considering if you do not need to travel out of Auckland."
2941,I travelled with my family from London Heathrow. We found the seats reasonably comfortable our 4 year old slept like a baby the whole flight out. The food was just fine with my wife and I enjoying our meals and our son was very happy with his. For the return flight my son fell asleep at takeoff so missed the normal meal time. When he woke up midflight the Flight Attendents had kept his meal and were quickly able to provide it resulting in a happy child who went straight back to sleep. Thank you for a good flight at a good price.
2942,MRU-LHR return A340. The flight could have been brilliant if not for one stewardess on the first leg. Chief Purser and other crew more than helpful and caring. Food excellent on both legs compared to a recent previous trip. Some issues with toilets. Recurrent issues with the seats. IFE the same old story but beyond control of crew brought my Ipad and enjoyed my own movies.
2943,MRU-HKG return - A330 on first leg ok with quite new plane. A340 on return a different story the plane is old. Outbound food was not to standard. Overall the service was quite ok respect the staff and they should provide good service. Return leg service much better as well as the food. The seats in Business are quite of a kind the fabric and the sloppy position pull you downwards.
2944,Heathrow to Mauritius. Staff friendly however we paid Â£100 premium for 2 seats with extra legroom. Neither of the entertainment screens worked - in fact one was not even attached properly to the cable which had been previously taped on by an amateur. 11 hours is a long time without music or a film. Also for some unknown reason a passenger was allowed to sit in the jumpseat seat throughout the whole journey. This was unacceptable as she was right in our vision and took up the extra leg space we had paid extra for. The flight steward apologised and gave us name of the vice president of Air Mauritius customer services. When we attempted to contact him  we were told that customer services would contact us via e mail. We are still waiting. This airline is not doing us a favour. We paid a large sum of money for the flights plus the extra leg room premium. Not happy at all.
2945,BOM-GOI A319. Delayed flight without good explanation. FA's were friendly on this short flight. Mid afternoon flight with just a drink and peanuts I would have liked more.
2946,On time departure from CCU and on time arrival into BLR. Quality of food was good and they served an adequate dinner. Crew could be a little friendlier but the experience was better than expected.
2947,Cape Town to Walvis Bay [Namibia] return in business class B737-500. This was flying as it used to be good service hot meal on a 2 hour flight and large comfortable seats. Admittedly the outbound trip was 2 hours delayed and communication was poor but this is Africa and they did their utmost to turn it around when it did arrive. No doubt my holiday spirit affected my reaction to this if you had commitments it would have been a problem. I would use them again and would do the LGW to Namibia route with them. Safe professional and customer focussed.
2948,LHR - WDH and back during Nov 2008. Much better than expected. The food was very good and cabin crew were friendly & attentive. Plenty of water offered. My only gripe was the seat was very uncomfortable - OK once I fixed up extra cushioning for my lower back.
2949,WDH-CPT in Economy. B737-500 of unknown provenance but inside OK. The crew were pleasant and efficient the captain informative and a hot meal which was edible and fine. Timekeeping spot on too so a high mark. I have not experienced their single long-haul A-340 and its service but short-haul  perfectly OK.
2950,"My daughter and I are back in Sydney tonight thanks to Air Niugini going the extra mile.  When the flight from Alotau to Port Moresby was cancelled we were in a challenging situation, then when the rebooked flight from Alotau to Moresby couldn't land because of difficult weather conditions we had to overnight in Alotau and hope to connect early through a rescheduled flight from Alotau the following morning. The Air Niugini staff at Alotau handled a difficult situation for customers extremely professionally both the day of the delay issues and through rebooking everyone on the rescheduled flight the next morning. "
2951,SIN-POM-SIN on B767s. Friendly professional and efficient service from the crew made the flights bearable. Flights were largely on time. Exit row 10 had unbelievable leg room but it also meant other passengers climbed over us to get to the toilets in the other aisle. Food was ok. Touch-screen entertainment screens were great but bring your own headphones. Entertainment selection was limited.
2952,Rome to Marseille on July 17. Flight was late to depart after boarding I asked for water but was asked to wait until take off. After my repeated request I got a glass of water. Luggage was delivered late in Marseille - spent more than one hour to get it - no explanation in English. We could not go to our hotel after the flight because there were no taxis and the hotel shuttle service has finished at midnight. Hope they will improve their service.
2953,I flew from Paris to Johannesburg in March. The weather was very poor however the flight was not delayed because of it we were boarded and then sat on the plane for 4 hours with nothing happening. The only reason given at the time was that the luggage had not arrived at the aircraft but we had no idea how long it was likely to be. As a result I missed a connecting flight. I will never consider flying with them again.
2954,CDG (2F) - NCE. The flight was in a newly refurbished A320. Crew friendly and professional. Decent value for the money for the 1hr 15 mins long flight.
2955,Bangkok to Paris departing 10am on July 2nd. Fed a full meal with Wine and Port about 30 mins into the flight. The meal was OK. I was feeling unwell due to heat stroke and asked for a brandy but was told that spirits were not available - only soft drinks water or beer. During the flight I needed water I had to use the call button several times before they came to see what I wanted. Later when I asked for more water the attendant said that I could always get my own. No other food served for almost 10 hours and then just a snack. It is the worst long haul flight I have ever experienced. The service was non existent.
2956,NZ104 19 April SYD-AKL on the Dreamliner. The team in the business class cabin worked non stop during this relatively short flight delivering excellent service. The plane which was apparently Air New Zealands launch 787 was still new and abounded in technology. There is now a marked difference in the video entertainment system compared to other aircraft. The video screen is now High Definition and is like using a smartphone app. One thing you do immediately notice in the cabin is the size of the windows the cabin had a nice open feeling and the dimming feature meant that you could set the lighting to almost any setting that was comfortable. The meals included some of Peter Gordons creations the poached chicken salad was huge and did me for the rest of the day.
2957,20/4/2015 Flight SQ4282. I booked a trip AKL to London with Singapore Airlines one of the flights offered for the first leg was a codeshare with Air NZ as the operator late night departure suited best so it was booked. Arrived at the airport to find one check in desk aircrew only self check points for everyone else I queried this and the solution to check in involved 1 staff member using 4 different self check points. Seated on board I looked for a flight magazine in the seat pocket were a safety sheet a sick bag and a dog eared price list for snacks such as nuts crisps etc once airborne the drinks trolley appeared some turbulence was encountered minor in my experience and the drinks trolley quickly disappeared followed by an announcement that serving drinks was not possible sometime later a tray appeared with a choice of water or orange this was to be the only time this service was offered during the 10+ hour flight. Some time later a meal was served complete with plastic cutlery nothing wrong with the meal some even got coffee however the tray remained uncollected shortly before landing I was handed a breakfast tray which I placed on top of the debris on the previous meal tray since no offer to remove it was forthcoming and the trolley moved on. Singapore to London with Singapore Airlines was a somewhat different experience I arrived at the airport after a short stopover in Singapore to find 7 manned check in desks I walked away from the desk with a boarding card in under 15 seconds. Seated on board I find no fewer than 3 different S.A. magazines the following items were then offered seperately in this order during the flight - while still on the ground hot towels were offered - socks package for the late night flight-newly printed menu also containing a list of complimentary snacks available on request such as nuts crisps etc nuts-drinks-meal with metal cutlery coffee/tea-water-waterx2-waterx3-hot towels-collect rubbish-breakfast coffee/tea. The return trip LHR to AKL with S.A. was a similar pleasant experience. Anyone out there booked to fly Air New Zealand? Good luck with that one!
2958,AKL to LAX on May 9. Great service. When flying economy on Air New Zealand's 777-300 I always choose one of the pairs of seats at the very back of the plane usually the second or third forward from the back. It's a bit tight in economy and the aisle is wider there. Crew were awesome. Food was fine. Price paid on one of the airlines many sales was excellent.
2959,Mauritius to Delhi. I found the quality of seats very average in the aircraft. In fact even in business class one of the seats couldn't move back. Worst of all the main attendant was rude and unfriendly. She didn't let me see my elderly parents travelling separately in business class the whole flight knowing that they may need my help / assistance in spite of repeated requests. Very disappointed.
2960,PER-MRU-LHR MRU-PER. Not too bad an airline. A340 aircraft are reliable however Air Mauritius need to review their seats which are quite hard for long haul flights and worn in some cases. Food is average but cabin staff friendly and efficient. In flight entertainment could be upgraded. Checkin and boarding very efficient.
2961,LHR-MRU-LHR. Air Mauritius use their most modern A340's on the London route which are quiet and smooth. Sat in economy and was surprised at how tight the legroom is and I'm only 5ft 9in. That was the only real negative about the flight. IFE boxes are also under each seat which limits your ability to stretch out your legs. I'm used to BA and Virgin's economy cabins which are more spacious. IFE was ok but not enough choice for a 12hr flight. Food was pretty good and tasty. Staff were pleasant and happy to help with requests.
2962,ORD-DEL-HYD-BOM-DEL-ORD. The last time I flew them was in 2007 and I found it to be average. Now the air hostesses were friendly and attentive food was great and the IFE pretty good. The seat and spacing was pretty good and ample in comparison to other airlines. The only downside I see is from Indian security at the airports.
2963,PNQ-GOI in Economy. Flight was on time check-in efficient with friendly ground staff. Served snacks and drinks by a friendly crew on the rather short flight. On the negative side: cabin was dirty with torn and worn- out seats. My seat consisted of a big crater-like hole and was very inconvenient.
2964,Air Namibia Jo-burg to Windhoek return. Both were excellent flights on time and with service from very good cabin crew - including meals that we used to expect but now no longer receive from major airlines including BA and Iberia. No hesitation in thanking Air Namibia commending them for the flights or recommending them to others.
2965,LGW to Windhoek return. Flight on time outbound and return with efficient boarding at LGW although free for all at Windhoek; however crew curt to the point of being rude except for one female cabin attendant on return leg. Food barely edible especially going out. Seats have plenty of leg room but are uncomfortable as the lumber bars do not work. Some problems with the heating - cold going out and excessively hot on return. IFE very basic largely with third rate films. Business lounge in Windhoek too small as a number of largish flights to CPT and JNB all going at at same time as LGW flight. I appreciate that Air Namibia is a cheap option and a direct route from London but would think twice before using them again.
2966,Frankfurt to Windhoek return Economy. Check in no problem. Flights on time. Seats ok. Food reasonable. Outward leg was the first time I have ever been cold at the back of an Airbus. In flight service disappointing. Crew did the minimum they could get away with. On occasions were actually rude. Uncaring and ignored requests for assistance. Main screen entertainment only with non functioning headphones. I do not recommend air Namibia but they have little competition to push standards up. German 'um pah' music during boarding and disembarking amused the Germans as well as the Brits!
2967,"PX4 BNE-POM 29/12. Re-fitted 767. Don't know who designed and who signed off the new economy layout but there are serious flaws. 2 toilets only for the whole of economy and they are situated mid cabin. There is no void space around the toilets so any queue just forms in the aisles. There is a seat right by the door to the toilet so this poor passenger cops the door opening and closing all flight plus the odour. Would be a nightmare seat on an overnight flight. Why is the ""latest technology"" entertainment system not gate to gate. I've had is turned on anywhere between 5 and 25 mins after the seatbelt sign was switched off and then turned off at the started of decent - 30 mins out. Result -movie not finished. Service slow mechanical. Food quite good. New seats ok for short flight but would be uncomfortable on longer haul - too hard and seat base too short -no under thigh support."
2968,One of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. Of course you can not expect much in a country like Papua New Guinea. Overall I had six domestic flights all were delayed by at least one hour. All planes were in a disappointing condition. The cleanliness was poor the crew were rude incompetent and not very service oriented.
2969,MNL-POM-RAB return in Business. In the last five years flying with Air Niugini service and airplane quality has deteriorated dramatically. A flight inside PNG has become an absolute lottery game without help whatsoever from the ground crew.
2970,Flew Air Niugini from Cairns to Port Moresby on a Fokker F100. Departed on time fantastic food great crew.
2971,Departing from Washington Dulles to CDG Paris AF0027 June 21st and returning from CDG AF0026 to Dulles 7/2. I will never fly Air France again - my 13 year old daughter and myself went for 2 weeks to Paris - flew Business Class. Going over the food was good (not great) however I noticed how frayed some of the seats in business class were which was just the beginning. Seat is horrible so no sleep for me coming back my tray table was broken (yes in Business class) so I had to prop it up with my knees as I didn't want to sit apart from my daughter. The food was terrible and the seat again was horrible if you are trying to get some sleep.
2972,I have being flying regularly with Air France for the past 9 years in economy and business class. Normally inflight economy service is excellent with good range of food and beverages available and being offered. On the flight from Paris to Bangkok (July 12) although the plane was newish and with good entertainment the service was absent. The dinner service was a tray with no selection of food or drinks. It contained a pre-packaged cocktail and red wine. No other beverages were offered and no other drinks or snacks offered during the flight. At one point during the flight I went in search of a glass of water not having been offered or provided anything for several hours. I was given a drink and told to go to another galley where I might find ice cream if I was lucky - not even the crew knew what was available. This took self serve to a whole new level. This was one step away from a pack lunch. I chose Air France above other less expensive airlines as I had always enjoyed Air France service and variety offered. A premium airline cannot charge a premium price and fail to provide service otherwise why pay the price when a cheaper alternative provides the exact same thing. I will not fly Air France again.
2973,Flew DXB-CDG-BCN return. Most uncomfortable economy class flights I have taken. Seat was completely rigid and stiff very cramped. On the return I was it in 35A on the 777-300 at the emergency exit. This was even more painful than the outbound sectors. There was no space between the fuselage and arm rest to actually rest my arm. Had a tall gentleman sitting next to me; was completely cramped with door bustle in front of me so couldn't stretch legs to take advantage of being in an 'aisle seat'. Again seat was hard and uncomfortable. I felt very sore after all my flights. Never again!
2974,ORLY-IST-CDG July 1. I always check in online to save time but shouldn't have bothered for ORLY-IST leg. I was at the airport at 8am for a 10.25am flight. I was misdirected to the wrong bag drop off point. I then joined another enormous queue. It took over an hour to simply drop off my bag. No dedicated lines for just dropping off your bag. There were incredible delays at passport control which was again compounded by a disorganised slow aircraft boarding which appeared haphazard and the plane left nearly 30 minutes late. I had intended have breakfast at the airport but this was impossible due to time delays. On board service was fine but disinterested. The A320 was a little worn on the way back. Boarding again was disorganised and unpleasant. These flights were in complete contrast to my CX flights (SYD-CDG-SYD).
2975,Flew AKL-PVG on the 787-9. Seat was very comfortable for sitting: a bit more recline would've made it excellent. But for sleeping 'twas marvellous: so comfortable. Crew were attentive and dinner was good breakfast (waffle) was horrid.
2976,NZ 87 9th April Auckland - Hong Kong. A dreadful flight poor service indifferent staff food quality below par. No flight announcements to advise of flight being really bumpy flight crew could at least have said something. Air New Zealand used to be a reasonable airline and their domestic service still is but internationally they are now very poor.
2977,Don't bother paying extra for the Air NZ Works Deluxe experience. We decided to splurge on our return Sydney- Auckland flight and pay the extra for a works deluxe seat. At $450 it was nearly three times the cost of our outbound no food no bags flight with Virgin. Never again! The Premium check-in queue turned out to be slower than the 'normal' queues. The Sydney lounge is utterly awful worn out furniture (holes in the arms of chair I sat in) and dreadful food. Yes the drinks are free but t's a huge price to pay for a couple of G&Ts. Yes having a guaranteed spare seat beside us was good but we had that on our cheap Virgin flight out. The food was very lack- lustre and you had to really make an effort to get a second drink. They even forgot my meal though that was quickly rectified once I was able to get hold of a staff member. My advice is to save your money and fly economy.
2978,Mumbai to Kolkata. Plane at gate on time but apparently staff were not! After 30 minutes without any information the Indian passengers started to complain. Within minutes the complaints turned into loud shouting. Whatever was shouted produce results because the gate opened almost immediately. Full flight. Comfortable seating with good leg room (for economy). Good meal which included veg and non-veg choices. Overall Air India have a reasonably good domestic product but it appears they are struggling with reliability.
2979,Just got back from a fantastic trip to Namibia but Air Namibia provided a disappointing end to the trip. They cunningly changed the time of the flight bringing it forward by an hour and a half so instead of getting to the airport almost 3 hours before departure it turned out to be leaving in an hour! Clearly no-one else had been told either as the queue was out the door - and to cap it all they only had one check-in desk open - I couldn't believe it! We eventually checked in about 2 minutes before it was due to take off and eventually left almost an hour late. A real shambles and what annoys me is that they clearly have all my contact details and could have contacted me via email or mobile to inform of the changes - I guess that would be too much to ask. I have traveled around the world and never re-confirmed a flight but would strongly recommend that you do with Air Namibia - it seems that the airline can't match the service and customer experience that the rest of Namibia offers.
2980,"WDH-CPT. The plane seemed to be an old Air France 737 as I noticed ""Air France"" on the seat belts and ""Sortie"" for exit. Although an old aircraft it was clean and the crew were professional. I also quite enjoyed the hot meal that was served. Much better than I expected!"
2981,I have the misfortune of using Air Niugini often through lack of choice. Most recent flight was POM- SIN return. The airline is now leasing an aging White Airlines A310 which is older than the previous B767. Seats are appalling IFE does not work and toilets are constantly unservicable. The food is passable but really nothing special. Service is slow and Cabin crew seem unable to deal with complaints or concerns raised by passengers. Overall Air Niugini is not deserving of a three star ranking - a two star ranking would be more appropriate given the decline in the airline's international services.
2982,BNE to POM POM to Mt Hagen and return. Was very impressed with service. Cabin staff could not be faulted and very obliging and friendly.
2983,SIN-POM Busines Class. Check in at Singapore easy as we were early and able to take advantage of general early check in desk and also a separate Premium check-in area is available. Lounge at SIN is nice with a bit of food. Chaotic getting on plane with lot of pushing - we were sent down at a time when the Economy passengers were still queuing to go through security. Plane very hot and stuffy. Food edible - but you do not need 2 meals on an overnight 6 hour flight! Real problem are seats - the plane is a very tired leased 767 with seats that do not recline much and a poor foot-rest. They are the most uncomfortable seats I have experienced in either business class or economy for a long time. My husband could not sleep so put on his i-pod and was immediately told to turn it off as it was interfering with the radio. IFE did not work.
2984,Coming back from Hong Kong to Paris with AF185 I've been delighted to discover I was upgraded to business class. Happy about that and would recommend Air France again. Service was great - only remark is about the seat: I miss the 180Â° business class seat I could experience with another company.
2985,CAI-CDG May 19 2013. Flying Business class the check in was smooth and friendly the staff helped me to check my luggage directly to Reykjavik Iceland although my connecting flight was on Icelandair and on a Separate ticket. Boarding was good and quick but the crew in the business class cabin were mostly grumpy with no traces of a smile for the whole trip. The seats were nice and comfortable but the headphones were really old and squeaked. Food was ok nothing special for business class.
2986,Although we bought the round trip from Paris to Rome at least 2 months in advance we couldn't get the airline to confirm our seats. Called a few days before and were told not to worry that we would get the seats at the airport the day of the flight. At the airport they told us that we were on stand by list. We barely made it to the flight and we were all seated separately in the middle seats. We found out later that they open the seats 30 hours before the flight so passengers can get their seats but we were never told us about it. If I can I will avoid traveling with this company in the future!
2987,Flew LAX to AKL and return first leg in Business return in premium economy. The Business class is world class crews are excellent food was excellent and the seat while a unique design really gives comfort and privacy. Sleep is necessary on a 13 hr flight that leaves at 10pm and it was easy. the spaces eat on the return leg gives privacy and space but i found the lack of recline made sleep difficult. Again food and crews were excellent. The 777-300 is a great plane with a lot of space but frankly I can't imagine this trip in economy.
2988,We travelled premium economy Melbourne to LA. It cost about double the economy return. The first leg (to Auckland) wasn't called premium economy although it was in the premium economy cabin and we paid for premium economy. It was called something like 'Works Plus' and you only got economy food. At Melbourne airport we were prevented from priority boarding because of this difference which seemed a bit pathetic. The great advantage of premium economy on Air NZ is that you get plenty of room and the seat in front can't recline into your space. The seats are not great there is no footrest and the seat doesn't flip up to support your feet. On the long flight you are given sort of foot-bean-bags which are quite handy but you aren't given those on the shorter leg. In fact on the first leg I had to be quite insistent to beg for a couple of ordinary cushions from a flight attendant who was very reluctant to hand them over! The seats are actually hard to operate which the staff are clearly aware of. A problem with the seats is that they all face slightly or considerably away from each other. Perhaps this is meant to be for privacy but personally I prefer to sit parallel to the person next to me even if I don't know him/her. It was frustrating not being able to talk properly to my husband on the flights. Another disadvantage of the configuration is that you can't comfortably lie down across both seats if the plane is empty (as it was on the way home from LA to Auckland-we would actually have been better in economy as everyone back there got a row each and could lie down properly! But of course you can't predict that). The food on the longer legs is nice but it seems very odd that they bring out the desserts with the starters and you have to sit and look and the dessert through your starter and main course. As the trays and tables are very small and a bit unstable this is actually a real pain. It is also difficult to get drinks served with your meal. They bring the drinks after the meals and personally I can't eat a meal without drinking something. In general the staff were pretty unhelpful. It was difficult to get a soft drink or orange juice at all times. I was also refused an inflight magazine when I asked. I was told they weren't produced and were 'online'. The safety video (Lord of the Rings-style) was incredibly annoying. So - lots of space but a not very good seat. Nice food but wobbly trays. Snarly staff in the main. Avoid the front row in premium economy as the configuration is even worse than the other rows.
2989,Flight NZ 282 AKL-SGP. We had booked flight with Singapore Airlines but new arrangement with Air NZ caused transfer to Air NZ. Although the plane and food was good the comparison to Singapore Airlines certainly did not favour ANZ. On SGP Airlines the attendants give you warm towel before takeoff and keep circulating in the cabin with drinks and eats. On ANZ we only saw attendants when meals were served and needed to ring for them when we wanted anything else. No duty free offered on ANZ and bathrooms were devoid of any extras like mouthwash and hand moisturiser etc etc. ANZ very pleasant but cannot compare to SGP Airlines.
2990,JFK-DEL-JFK in Economy over the Christmas period. Flight from JFK to DEL was excellent. The aircraft seemed new was very clean and the IFE selection was good. Boarding etc. were far smoother than I am used to on BA my usual carrier on this route. Food was good and the inflight staff were young professional without being stiff and/or overbearing. My experience was enhanced by having been given an exit-row seat. But even the return flight was good and this time I had a ghastly middle seat. Nevertheless the staff kept up well- fed and hydrated; there was an ample supply of cookies/chips/drinks in the galley and the flight was quite pleasant. Timings again are superb - essentially an overnight flight; leave home in Delhi after dinner; arrive in JFK in time for breakfast. Overall I was pleasantly surprised.
2991,Seoul to Hong Kong round trip. Flight to Hong Kong left and arrived early. The inflight entertainment was good although the English movie selection was a bit outdated. The flight crew was pleasant. Food was really good. Return flight left and arrived on time. Same thing for inflight entertainment. My headphones were broken but the attendant promptly got me a new set. Breakfast (omelette and croissant) was again really good. Overall great value for money.
2992,Travelled in premium Economy and was disappointed with the overall experience. Seats were not very comfortable and the service very poor. The long haul flights catered for vegetarian diet and were of average quality however the short haul (2.5 hrs) did not have any meal suitable for a non meat or fish eating passenger. Staff did not seem to care and made no attempt to find me something to eat. Premium economy is not worth the extra money paid as apart from a wider seat the service was no different than flying economy and poor in comparison to premium economy used on other airlines.
2993,Went from JFK to CDG and back in premium economy. Sky priority allowed us to check in and get through security very quickly. We took advantage of the business class lounge (paid about $50 per person) and thought it was well worth it for the food wine and quiet. The premium economy seats although roomier than economy were nowhere near business class standards so do not expect to get a comfortable night's sleep. I did appreciate the extra legroom and the fixed shell design as this made it feel quite spacious. The food was really quite good (though keep in mind it is from an airline not a French bistro) and the service was very polite and friendly. I felt very taken care of the entire flight and would definitely travel on Air France again over most of its competitors.
2994,Fly from Birmingham to Seoul via Paris. Had very pleasant trips apart from the hiccup at the check-in desk at Seoul but overall inflight service was very good! Quite a wide range of choices for the inflight entertainment inflight meal was average but acceptable. The cabin crew could do with a bit more smile but the staff at Paris was extremely friendly which was good. Would definitely like to fly with Air France again.
2995,"NZ 281 25 Mar and NZ 282 on 2 Apr. Took the Premium Economy class flight to and from Auckland and I loved it. The seats are spacious and comfortable and it definitely felt much better than a red-eye flight on Economy. The complimentary bottle of water is a great touch because you do tend to get very dehydrated on a flight and having the bottle meant you didn't have to ask for a glass of water from the attendants every 10 minutes or so. The pillow provided is big and soft and very comfortable whether to hug or to prop against your back. The USB and power outlet though not uncommon anymore are still very much appreciated. I'm not sure if this feature exists in other airlines or if it's even a plausible concept but it may be great if a passenger can play his/her own media via a USB device eg. movies on a thumb drive or the sort. On the flight to Auckland there were just a handful of people in the Premium Economy cabin so service was impeccable and thoughtful right from the start. The attendants even came around mid-flight to make sure everything was okay for me. On my return it was a fully- booked flight so the attendants really had their work cut out for them. But they were still thoughtful and reasonably efficient. I would definitely fly with Air NZ again if I get the chance. Oh and did I mention that their safety video is really ""epic""? It's the only safety video which I personally have ever given 110% attention to."
2996,AKL-RAR then a week later RAR-LAX-LHR on 2x B767 and B777. Exit row seats on B767 and preferred seat (double) on B777.Only delay was RAR-LAX when we aborted take off due to a warning light soon fixed and we were on our way. Great service and IFE on all 3 legs.
2997,IVC-CHC-AKL on ATR72 and A320.We checked in early due to heavy rain and the need to return a rental car and were at the agents suggestion put on earlier flights at no extra cost. Great customer service. Drink and snack on both flights.
2998,NPE-AKL-CHC on ATR72 and A320. We should have travelled via Wellington to Christchurch we had checked in early having returned a rental car and were having a coffee when we were asked to go to check in desk the agent said weather was bad in Wellington and flights are being delayed did we wish to go via AKL arriving in CHC 2 hours earlier than planned we took up his offer. This was excellent unrequested customer service. Drink and snack on these short legs.
2999,25 Dec flew Chicago-Delhi connecting Ahmedabad. Check-in was quick and departed on time. Inflight meals plenty with beverages and alcohol offered free of charge. 2 full hot meals and small snacks during flight. Sky bar open for extra snacks with beverages. Comfortable seats and lots of leg room with foot rest a plus. Courteous staff ready to help. Transit in Delhi a breeze. Baggage arrived promptly at Ahmedabad and was out within 45 minutes. Return Ahmedabad Chicago via Delhi. Again no issues except 1hour delay in Delhi. All in all very good experience and would recommend.
3000,Flew from Rio/GIG to CDG last month. Selected the option for a seat plus on the upper deck of the 747-400. This gives you additional leg room and a smaller cabin so in my view worth the extra money. Crew were excellent on this trip friendly and chatty. Food was good. For me the seat became very uncomfortable after 4 hours. I have travelled many times with Air France over the years and the crews can be very hit and miss. This crew were one of the best.
3001,San Francisco to Paris. Staff not very friendly like they didn't want to be there. They were more interested in chatting between themselves than giving a great experience to passengers. Seats not very comfortable and food was poor quality. Same movies both ways - poor selection. Last time with Air France for me.
3002,BCN-CDG return flight. A good experience overall: both flights were on-time lounges were very comfortable (specially the one at CDG airport) cabin crew was peasant and efficient. Excellent selection of beverages although food was quite poor. Prior disembarking and luggage delivery was respected. However I regret that Business class seats (Airbus 321 for both flights) are not real one. AF like LX or LH for example just neutralize the middle seat on the row. This is not what you are expecting for over ??50. An amazingly good flight however.
3003,Guangzhou - Paris 18 June. Have been flying AF for years and have been very disappointed with them recently but this flight was a good turn around. Check in at CAN terrible but flight left early and arrived early food back to good standards and very good drink service. B777 so the TV screen was a bit small. Only complaint as usual after the meal service the crew totally disappear.
3004,Gisborne-Christchurch NZ8652 and NZ0525. Wonderful experience travelling with two pre-school age children from Gisborne to Auckland and then on to Christchurch. The whole way was a pleasure with the pilots making our kids day by waving to them from the cockpit and the air hostess that let my daughter handout the sweets. I will point out the plane was running slightly late so it would have been understandable for them to be feeling slightly rushed and not accommodating but staff went above and beyond in all aspects.
3005,HKG-AKL in Economy. My daughter recently took this trip as part of a school trip. The flight was very average however her comment to me made me laugh. She pressed the call button to ask for some water it was delivered but was told not to use it again but actually come and get the water herself. She asked what is the call button for then to wake to wake you up. The stewards do not see the funny side of her comment.
3006,DEL-DXB on an A330-200. There was no personal television and shared TV's were not in a good condition. The toilets smelt and there was a shortage of vegetarian food so I did not eat anything. The crew was co- operative but had limited English skills. I will never fly Air India again Emirates is much better.
3007,Hong Kong to Seoul on a Boeing 777-300 - had 2 check-in counters open for the entire flight. Took me an hour just to get to the check-in line and all I had was carry-on items. After boarding and finding my seat I discovered my assigned seat with a used blanket and pillow and a used water bottle stuffed in the seat pocket in front of me. Along with stains on the seat in front of me and dirt and grime covering the fold out table. The floor alongside the cabin walls were covered in dirt and trash and the plastic shielding for many of the seat parts were cracked. I tried to find reprieve in another seat but the rest of the cabin was in similar condition. Worst flight I have ever taken.
3008,"Air North describes its class of service as ""Yukoner Economy"", which I thought probably referred to a concept of warm-hearted hospitality and generosity. This held true for my first flight in their 737-400, but after flying in the HS748 I'm wondering if the term is actually more about resilience in the face of harsh conditions! Cramped conditions in the HS748 aside, the service overall was pretty good - staff were (almost) all friendly and efficient, flights ran on schedule, and reasonable food was provided. No in-flight entertainment system, but at the time I flew, the stunning ever-changing landscape below was all the entertainment I could want."
3009,YVR-YXY in Economy. Check-in agents were quick and boarding commenced on time. On board the aircraft was old and not well maintained and in need of refurbishment. No inflight entertainment and seat pockets tray table and carpet were dirty. Inflight snacks mediocre. Seat was worn and not comfortable though the pitch seems to be pretty standard with Air Canada. Cabin crew announcements were rushed and inaudible. Service was the highlight and the crew were friendly. Flight arrived on-time and baggage was a short wait.
3010,BKK - LHR with short connection in Paris. A very enjoyable flight considering it was one that returned me reluctantly from my holiday. IFE was good and food and drink excellent (typical French) with Port and Wine accompanying the food (including cheese obviously). Although the meal was above average it was scarce from then on although I took the liberty of visiting the staff at the rear of the plane and they were happy to dish out the snacks and drink as desired. Very happy with the staff and service all in all.
3011,Birmingham - Paris - Barcelona AF1065 AF1248 June 19th and return Barcelona - Paris - Birmingham AF1149 AF1968 June 21st. Terrible attitude terrible service terrible punctuality. Took Air France to get to Barcelona from Birmingham via Paris. Mistake. Will use KLM or Lufthansa in future.
3012,CDG-MAD-CDG as part of an international itinerary KUL-CMB-CDG-CMB-KUL. For the short duration of one hour and forty minutes Air France certainly gets you from Point A to Point B in good time. The seat on their A318 isn't something to shout about - no recline even for a short snooze. IFE non-existent on these short legs.
3013,"Flew from Honolulu to Auckland. Paid a small fee for a preferred bulkhead seat. It was one of the most uncomfortable seats I have flown. No space to extend my legs (I flew bulkhead many times before but the seat has never been so close to the wall) and since they installed the control for the entertainment system inside the arm rest it was also extremely narrow. I am 6""2 and athletic. I can't imagine what this seat would be like for an overweight. When I complained to the flight attendant she said 'at least nobody is going to recline their seat'. I was aware of that and I believe that was the whole point of paying extra. Additional issues: the plane looked so old it was sad only one suitcase to check in even on an international flight food was less than mediocre. I would definitely fly Hawaiian airlines on my next trip. On top of all this I did not get any mileage credit on united on my return flight. I did get it on the way there so it was not the type of ticket."
3014,Travelled from London to Auckland. Having lived in London for the last 11 years I was on a flight moving back to New Zealand permanently. Flew with Singapore Airlines on SQ317 from London to Singapore and had excellent service the whole way. The flight attendants were friendly food was served quickly and was delicious trays were removed quickly and we were constantly provided refreshments. At the beginning of the flight my sister was having problems with her entertainment console so the attendant offered to re-boot the system. it was done immediately and they checked after a couple of minutes that it was working. It happened a couple of times during the flights so the attendant gave her a voucher to use towards a duty free item which was a very kind gesture. However our onwards flight from Singapore to Auckland was extremely disappointing and one of the worst long haul flights I have been on. Most of the flight attendants were very friendly (I did hear one tell a traveller that they couldn't fix their console as they were about to serve food which seemed very unhelpful) however their service was extremely lacking. Shortly after taking off we discovered that our entertainment consoles were not working properly but either continually freezing or losing sound. We pressed the buzzer for a flight attendant but after waiting 10 mins and watching them walk past us a couple of times we had to ask them in person for assistance. Rather than offer to re-boot the consoles as Singapore Airlines had done we were informed that they had been aware of the problem in Singapore but were unable to fix it until they got to Auckland. For a passenger on a 9 hour flight who has already travelled on a 12 hour flight just beforehand this was very disappointing news. We were both transferred to other seats (seated separately) however the cabin was so cold further forward that I ended up returning to my original seat. The service and quality of the food was also very disappointing. The chicken dinner we were served was very salty and the breakfast omelette was rubbery. The chicken sausage accompanying it was inedible. The attendants were also extremely slow with clearing the trays in comparison to Singapore Airlines. My sister is has Gold airpoints status so we had priority labels on our luggage however we were one of the last to get our luggage upon arrival in Auckland. Overall it was an extremely disappointing and frustrating flight. Like others who have placed reviews recently I will be very hesitant to fly Air New Zealand internationally in the future.
3015,BOM-DXB-BOM. Outbound flight on an A321 was on time. Only six channels on IFE and no headphones in seat-pocket. Meal (non-veg) was good both ways. Return flight delayed 3hrs. It was an A320 and IFE had same channels but there were headphones this time. Overall the aircraft and service is nice but the delays cause dissatisfaction. Flew AI just because the fares were much lower than other airlines.
3016,LAX to CGN via JFK CDG and AMS. Check-in in L.A. was easy. The staff in the Delta Terminal were very polite and dedicated towards passengers. First flight was operated by Delta and onboard they offered more then I had expected: At least 3 services and a very sophisticated inflight entertainment). The second flight from JFK to CDG was operated by Air France with an A380. I sat in the upper deck and the noise was hardly noticeable. In this fare stage they offered Champagne and delicious food. After dinner coffee or tea was served but I wanted alcohol again so I asked for a Gin and Tonic but the Steward had none. But 3 minutes later he came again and brought me my Drink. The two connection flights from CDG via AMS to CGN were very short but even there they had an excellent service I got a delicious sandwich and drinks and coffee.
3017,Boston - CDG in Business (bonus ticket): Sat in 3L a spacious bulkhead seat on Boeing 777. Crew very nice and helpful seat was pretty comfortable although not completely flat. Didn't check the entertainment as it was a night flight and wanted to relax and get some sleep what I did. Dinner was fine although not exceptional. Wine selection was good. Breakfast was a bit slim croissant and pain au chocolat were rather old and dry however the fruit platter was nice. No warm egg plate was offered. Overall a sound service and good experience.
3018,BSL-CDG-ATH 28/5/13. Small ATR72 to CDG no hand luggage allowed on the aircraft. Raining hard on landing no jetty got soaked running from aircraft to terminal no umbrellas. There is no covered walkway to the bus stop to wait for the bus to terminal 2G. Two flights departing the same gate terminal like a zoo. We have lived in France since 1989 and we always try to avoid Air France and especially CDG since previous bad experiences but this time it was unavoidable. Next time we will stay at home if obliged to take this route.
3019,AKL-LAX as part of a longer journey to Europe. First time in Economy on the 777-300. Cramming an extra seat in each row was a huge mistake: I was in the aisle seat and everyone including crew kept whomping me. If I wasn't using sleeping tablets to knock me out there is no way I could've slept in that seat. Meals were good and the crew were as well. As soon as NZ has competition on flights to the West coast they will bleed business. And I'm Airports Gold.
3020,We arrived at Wellington airport on 1st March 2015 for our return flight at about 1pm for flight NZ849 due to depart at 3.45 pm with a check-in time of 2.15 pm. We had booked and paid for this flight on 14th August 2014. Normal check-in procedures did not work and we were advised that the flight had a weight problem and we should check back at 2.30. We advised that we would miss a medical appointment made 4 months previously if we did not catch the flight. When we checked back we were advised that we could not go as the plane had a weight issue. Our luggage was not weighed at any time prior to this and was about half of the allowed weight. If the issue really was one of weight then Air New Zealand is obviously incapable of flying with the baggage allowances that it has set and if passengers with half that allowance are denied access to a flight booked over 6 months previously then they should look at a fairer way of deciding exactly who they will allow on planes. It would seem that this was just an excuse and I strongly suspect that the real issue was that Air New Zealand had over-booked the flight and the issue was one of seating on the plane. If this is indeed the case then it would have been better to have been told this from the outset instead of being jerked around by being told to return at 2.30 pm. Air New Zealand did arrange for alternative travel the next day and they did arrange for overnight accommodation with meals (but no drinks at all including non-alcoholic drinks and the meal allowance for dinner was only sufficient for the main course without either entree or dessert). They also provided both of us with $300 travel vouchers with them but we feel that being lied to and treated in a shoddy manner once by a company is unfortunate: to give that company the opportunity of doing it again is stupidity.
3021,Flew Auckland to Heathrow on 23/02/2015 in PE in Space Seats these are great seats you are in your own space no one can recline into your space. Entertainment very good and staff between Auckland and LA were brilliant they could not do enough for you and were always making sure you had everything you needed I wish I could say the same for those between LA and Heathrow who were absent from the cabin for a large amount of the time and did not have any real interface with the passengers. I ordered a coffee in the early hours and this was delivered promptly but I still had the cup over 2 hours later as the staff were absent from the cabin not very good service. Those staff on the Heathrow leg could learn a lot from those on the Auckland leg.
3022,DEL-IXU via Bhubaneshwar. Both flights were on time on a CRJ 700. Naturally comfort factor comes down to zero. No IFE and almost nil leg space. Seats are cramped and offer almost no push back. Meals were served well and decent keeping in mind that airlines in India are all trying to do away with the catering concept entirely. The ticket prices are quite stiff for this route and yet there is no business class on this aircraft. Its a small plane that can accommodate only 70 passengers. I have been flying Air India for a while but this experience will make me think before buying a ticket for another flight. When you are flying for 4 hours and paying a high price you certainly wish for a comfortable journey.
3023,2 June 2013 Johannesburg to Paris CDG AF 995. Don't go to the toilet while breakfast is being served because you will not get any. Even though I was travelling Business Class I was told that I could not have my meal as I was not seated when service on. I have travelled on many Business class flights and have never been told this. I was only away for about 5 minutes. My husband had not even started his meal. Air France can learn so much from the Eastern airlines. Singapore Air Emirates Thai! I will never fly Air France again.
3024,CDG-JFK. AF-006 2013-05-21. The airline offers an average to good economy class service nothing out of the ordinary. The in-flight entertainment system is very disappointing slow and with limited choice. The food however is excellent much better than most other airlines. The crew was very nice and professional but with apalling language skills: there is a point when a French accent is no longer attractive.
3025,Seoul-Paris CDG 777-300ER. Friendly and attentive crew excellent inflight entertainment system and good food. The only problem are the seats: way too cramped for a 12-hour flight!
3026,2 weeks ago my husband and I went to New Zealand. For years we travelled with Air Canada or Air New Zealand and this last time we made a big mistake and decided to fly with United. We prolonged our arrival to Auckland by a few good hours but we would co-op with these extra hours had it not be for the awful time on the flight to and from Auckland. The disrespect and disregard to it's passengers is shameful. There is no room for peoples' legs. This is a very long flight and airlines need to consider peoples' health as well. The food was awful. Cold and not edible. The flight attendants were beyond rude. I was shocked when 2 of them who could not decide if the liquid in the pots are tea or coffee simply removed the lids and put their noses in. People stared in disbelief. However when we got to Sydney Australia we embarked on an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland. What a huge difference. All of the sudden we could stretch our legs. The food was edible and the flying attendants were courteous. Going back home to Canada the experience repeated itself. We flew Air New Zealand to Sydney and everything was good and then hell repeated itself when we had to embark Untied from Sydney to Canada. My husband and I decided that never again will we fly United. Our son who was wiser flew Air New Zealand and he mocked us for choosing United. They are bad news to the rest of the carriers on star alliance. Life is a school and we learned our lesson the hard way.
3027,I flew from Tokyo Narita to Auckland (767-300) then Wellington to Auckland (A320) and finally Auckland back to Tokyo (787-900). Both international flights were just average. Little things like lack of in-flight magazine plastic cutlery minimal updates from the flight deck and lack of menu bugged me. The service on the old and tired 767 was significantly lower than that on the 787. The touch screen on the 767 was not very responsive at all. I was very impressed with the in-seat bar service on the 787. At the touch of a button you could order a drink or snack from the comfort of your seat and it would be served to you within minutes. The international check in at Auckland Airport was a complete shambles with queues everywhere and a lack of order. I also don't understand why you can't check in online if you booked through a 3rd party travel agent. All other airlines allow this why not Air New Zealand? The domestic flight was excellent. For just a short 45 min flight we were treated very well with excellent service (cheese and biscuits wine and soft drinks). The pilots also kept us fully informed on the progress of the flight. All in all Air New Zealand is fine but the international service needs improving. I guess I was just expecting something more from the so called Kiwi hospitality.
3028,"Flew from Queenstown NZ to MEL on NZ837 in economy. Hadn't flown on Air NZ for 10 years and we were keen to see if all the hype around their new ""experience"" was justified so we paid extra and got ""the works"". We departed on time and arrived 20 minutes early. The amount of legroom in the A320 was a positive revelation as was the extent and content of offerings provided on the in-flight entertainment system. The meal was fine without being exceptional and the crew was terrific. It really was a pleasure to fly. Thumbs up to Air NZ based on this flight!"
3029,BKK-DEL. Only one food option. Seats almost do not recline entertainment screens are faulty flight info unavailable or not working no paper towels in WC. They did not distribute immigration forms onboard causing a delay later on during immigration formalities. A321 a wrong jet for a 5-hour flight.
3030,We had a connecting flight this morning from Paris to Amsterdam and then back to South Africa. Amsterdam flight delayed meaning we missed our flight to JNB. Told to go to customer service desk it was 40 min before we were helped. Flight changed to depart Paris direct to JNB 14 hours later. This took 40 min just to book new tickets the best we were offered was an economy food ticket no lounge no day room. It was our problem and nobody was going to help us. We went to the lounge and paid for a day pass. I fly on regular basis to Europe and have never been treated like this by any other airline. Our flight to Paris from Amsterdam coming on holiday was also delayed by 2 hours.
3031,Myself and my daughter received a one up upgrade to Business from Premium Economy San Francisco to Auckland 14th February. We were delighted about this however we soon wished we had stayed in Premium Economy as the cabin crew were extremely unfriendly and gave the impression that it was beneath them to attend to us. They rushed the meal service and hardly spoke to anyone and as for a smile forget it! The only upside to the upgrade was the lie flat bed  I am pleased that we didn't pay full price for this appalling service. Next time we will be staying in Premium Economy which was excellent.
3032,We travelled Brisbane to Auckland on 10th of February and were surprisingly upgraded to business class as the flight was overbooked. Our choice was to fly with a free bag each and we were initially given the very worst seats on the aircraft the two right at the back by the toilets. Only Air New Zealand charges $30 to choose a seat so the upgrade was appreciated. However during the meal I was told my choice was no available and that as an upgrade I did not count. I was offered the choice of two other meals but did not want either of them and settled for another starter. Flying this airline is not what it was it used to be a great experience now the on board staff don't really care what happens. This was once a pleasure to fly but now it is a relief to get off the plane and really nowadays we only fly with them for the points and they are very careful to book you on a non points earning ticket. Small wonder they are making a profit.
3033,Flying an old worn out 767 from Auckland to Honolulu and back. Yes the pilot got us where the ticket said we were going I'll them credit but felt crammed like sardines the entire time. Cant comment on the food as we had seat only plus bag though if you want to go for 8 hours without food or movies good luck getting sleep in these seats. Also should you choose no food or movies you get treated a bit like a second class citizen by some of the staff members. Ground staff lounge staff were good.
3034,LHR-DEL-BKK economy. I flew Air India for its generous 35kg baggage allowance. LHR-DEL 777 had tired seats with ironmongery sticking into my back but seats are spacious and many were unoccupied so plenty of room. Inflight entertainment - seat-back screens worked intermittently and the neighbouring seat had buttons missing from the controller. Choice of non-Indian movies very limited anyway. Plane held at the gate for about an hour after 21.30 scheduled departure and no attempt made to serve drinks. Drinks eventually served 2 hrs 40mins into the flight. No wine with the meal. Chicken curry was excessively greasy. Breakfast coming into DEL was also poor. Indian airports offer tediously repetitive security checks at different points and DEL-BKK was delayed 1 hr 20mins. After boarding we waited at the gate for another 40 mins whilst passengers from a delayed flight straggled on. The Airbus looked pretty tired but seats were more comfortable again not overly busy and service was somewhat better on this flight with water offered frequently. Drink service was limited again. Dinner was better quality than LHR and tasty but tiny portions were disappointing. They didn't seem to make up any time on this flight so although I'd allowed 3 hrs for my transfer to domestic in BKK I missed my connection. Timekeeping was consistently poor DEL is a series of queues cabin service was disinterested the planes are relatively new but shabby food and entertainment lacking - and the tickets are expensive.
3035,YYZ-DEL-CCU in business class. Clean plane working seats with recline for sleeping (not flat bed) reasonable Indian food service and hospitable staff. Slept for 7 hrs and enjoyed the flight especially the early arrival in DEL. Fair selection of video considering almost all of their passengers onboard are Indian. Air India staff supported my transit in DEL in an efficient manner and customs was provided on arrival in CCU.
3036,I flew SYD to AKL on a 777-200U after flying from Saigon and it was a real pleasure to fly. The cabin was new and very comfortable. The IFE was great with a very responsive touch screen that was more like a tablet than the usual unresponsive screens. The seat was very good with plenty of space - I am a large man and usually my knees touch the back of the seat but not on this plane. I didn't try the food as I was not feeling that well but the crew have a relaxed but competent manner.
3037,My wife and I chose to travel to Vancouver Premium Economy expecting it to be far better than regular Economy. Apart from the extra leg room we were disappointed. The seats were not very comfortable we did not have separate arm rests which was a big problem when a large person spilled over one for the entire return journey. The in- flight entertainment TV was old and malfunctioning to the extent that we gave up trying to watch certain movies. The food and service was good for us but not good for some who had no food choice when certain meals ran out. The staff were on the whole pleasant and helpful and apologetic about the seating and entertainment equipment. Overall we rated the experience a hardly worth the extra cost and would rate it as 5 out of 10. Disappointing for us as we have always previously enjoyed travelling with Air New Zealand.
3038,I travelled Works De-luxe Gold Coast to Auckland on 14/02/15 and returned on flight NZ937 on 21/02/15. I have done this trip on many occasions and have never been disappointed. Air New Zealand crew are so friendly and make you feel welcome. Due to ex tropical cyclone Marcia the return flight was diverted to Brisbane and we were then bussed to the Gold Coast airport. This was done efficiently and without fuss. I like the A320 for these short flights across the ditch. I only ever sit in seat 1A and have no complaints to make whatsoever.
3039,Delhi to Varanasi return. A321 superb flight. On time spacious seating efficient FA's delicious meal. Given that the plane was full and just 3 FA's serving I was impressed. Great experience overall.
3040,ORD-FRA-BOM-MAA return. ORD-BOM sector on Boeing 777-300ER The aircraft was clean the seat backs almost had no cushioning. The food was good the cabin crew were friendly though they rarely smiled. The AVOD was a joke too many freeze ups. The 2 hour layover in FRA was almost necessary for stretching and walking around a little bit. BOM-ORD was about the same the only difference being the cabin crew were smiling a little more. BOM-MAA was a red-eye on an Airbus 319 but they still served a light dinner which was nice after a 3 hour layover in BOM. Ground staff in BOM and MAA were courteous despite the time of night at 1 am and 3 am respectively. The return MAA-BOM was an evening flight and the food was slightly better as it was a full dinner but had to circle over BOM for an hour following a runway intrusion. Overall not bad but I was left with the impression that everybody did just the minimum and did not want to go the extra mile.
3041,GOA to BOM. On time departure and arrival clean aircraft with a light snack served during 50 mins flight. IFE was good . Great legroom on A321 and checked bags on the carousel by the time we reached the terminal gate.
3042,We flew Brisbane to Vancouver via Auckland (NZ 136/84 outbound) and return (NZ 83/135 inbound) We chose Air NZ based on recommendations and rating - boy were we disappointed. The aircraft (with the exception of NZ 135 seriously needs refurbishing the seats were hard and very cramped for long haul travel the IFE was terrible  the picture quality was poor to say the least and because there are no inflight magazines it took some time and patience to navigate. As experienced travellers one could only say that the food was as bad as it gets and if you want water after meal service you have to go look for someone to serve you. It would be nice if Air NZ would get into the current technology century and provide USB chargers in every seat not just in Business Class as were informed mid fight. Don't fall for the trap of paying extra for preferred seating unless you can fluke an exit row or bulkhead seat this is just a money grabber for the airline.
3043,I really don't understand the bad reviews. I flew LHR to LAX and both flights were excellent. Great friendly flight attendants and good food and IFE. Seat was comfortable and economy no more cramped than on more expensive airlines. Amazing value for money can't wait to fly Air New Zealand again.
3044,MAH-PMI return on ATR72. Both flights on time crew good. Prices seem steep for non residents of the Islands. Used Iberia/BA airmiles so only paid tax.
3045,777-200 Auckland to Vancouver suppose the easiest thing to say I will never fly long haul with NZ Airways again. IFE that was ancient and didn't work properly. I really don't enjoy having the passengers seat so close to my face when they recline. Not an enjoyable trip. Please update your cabins. Passengers pay good money and shouldn't be treated like this especially when there are plenty of options for getting to YVR.
3046,28th August 2013 I took a flight from Malaga to Melilla. I found the ground staff to be very professional and well turned out. They were welcoming and conducted their duties with pride. The flight was on an ATR aircraft which is ideal for the relatively short flight from Malaga to North Africa. The flight departed on-time and the cabin crew conducted a safety demonstration. Bizarrely one of the cabin crew showed the food to purchase card but then said there was nothing to buy! The flight was suitably comfortable and arrived into Melilla exactly as per schedule. Disembarkation was well managed and orderly. Overall I had a good impression of Air Nostrum. The tickets though seem expensive.
3047,Smooth way through the airport of Madrid. Check-in done online. The best way to do it nowadays. Even though Air Nostrum operates from the K area in Madrid this flight was boarded by bus which is ok. Very positive is the fact that you can deliver your hand-luggage next to the aircraft and thus not check it in or wait for it at a luggage belt. The stewardess was very friendly and well groomed. In general the cabin crews of Air Nostrum are young and good looking. The old CRJ200 was noisy and small not my favourite regional aircraft. The flight was short and uneventful. The inflight service consisted of 'tu menu' which is in your seat pocket and from which you can buy 'Iberia' style snacks and drinks. Not too long ago this carrier still offered free of charge beverages and even snacks and sandwiches.
3048,MAN-MAD-MAN on a newish CRJ900. Business takes me to Madrid a lot and this new route replaces the stop at LHR and shaves 4 hours off the journey for me. Friendly efficient clean with nothing to grumble about.
3049,Guys get into the 21st century and please please upgrade your planes on the Auckland/Hawaii route. I would have been more comfortable in a tiger moth. We fly business on medium to long hauls for the comfort and additional extras which by the way we also pay for. The seats in business class remind me of a Jason recliner but less accommodating. No real issues with service but the food does leave a bit to be desired. I do a lot of flying and although I am a parochial NZer give me Emirates anytime.
3050,I've flown long haul with Virgin and their Premium Economy product is excellent but Air New Zealand's just takes it that one notch above (although it does cost slightly more too). Firstly the seat - it's in a shell so the seat tilts and slides rather than reclines into the space behind you. You're also angled slightly and so if you're in the outer seats you're not obliged to talk to the person next to you - it's your own personal space. I paid the extra for seats at the front of the cabin and they're well worth the upgrade - so much legroom and easy to get in and out (useful if travelling solo). The centre seats are better for couples as you can share the space. Check their website for information. The food was excellent served on crockery with metal cutlery. You'll get your starter etc first and wait some time for the hot meal meanwhile your dessert is also sat in front of you being very tempting! The hot food was good although the menu options were a little unusual - both times I went for the fish as the other options (beef and chicken) contained various things I didn't care for. The service was impeccable - the staff were very friendly except one attendant who seemed a little off although still professional. Inflight entertainment is on a decent sized touch screen although there is also a remote in the side of the seat. The selection was surprising - there were a large number of retro movies rather than all the latest blockbusters (of which there were few). However this was actually quite nice as I watched a few older favourites rather than having to gamble on new choices. My favourite thing about the IFE was being able to order drinks and snacks from the screen. Just tap an option or two and it's delivered to your seat a few minutes later whilst you continue to watch your movie. All seats have USB sockets for charging and I think you can link them up to a USB drive but I didn't test this. Also charging sockets are available for your laptop. You can use a standard UK plug as well as US and some other options. The toilets! Firstly two toilets dedicated to Premium Economy - so no queuing. And they were the best - fancy wallpaper with funny fake bookshelves on it (read some of the titles) and music piped in too. Frankly I would pay the upgrade just for those! Finally when flying to the USA you are right near the front of the plane so you're off quickly and can hot foot it to immigration to hopefully beat the queues. Unless you have ridiculously high standards of what you expect from a metal tube flying through the air I don't think you'll be disappointed.
3051,SFO-AKL 777-300 Economy. Got a decent deal on an airfare but was a bit worried about the reports of the 3-4-3 configuration in Air New Zealand economy. It is very tight and this is magnified on a long flight. For me no amount of service compensated for the feeling of being jammed in like sheep. Clearly the bottom line is the only thing that matters. What was once one of the best economy classes in the sky has literally devolved into sardine class. In the future I would take longer routing to avoid Air New Zealand.
3052,MAD-MUC on a newer CRJ-1000. As opposed to our terrible experience on Iberia for the earlier legs of this trip this was a night-and-day difference. Clean modern plane with legroom efficient FA's drinks and snacks served. Air Nostrum does everything so much better than its parent. If you are compelled to take Iberia flights make sure you use Air Nostrum for as many legs as you can - it really is a superior experience.
3053,Madrid to Porto. A relatively modern CRJ1000 (2+2 seating) offered more legroom than Iberia A320. Flight almost an hour late but this is becoming the norm at Madrid-Barajas so it's not a big deal. Crew pleasant and served drinks and a small packet of nuts on 1 hour flight.
3054,Madrid to San Sebastian on Canadair RJ 200. Just four business class seats on this 35 minute short-haul regional flight. Very friendly and attentive service with free drinks and filled rolls for business. Oversize hand luggage was put in the hold and could be collected on the tarmac at the destination. You wouldn't really pay for business on this regional airline as it's not really value for money for such short hops. But if you happen to travel in this class then it's very pleasant.
3055,Madrid-Murcia return. I've had a few flights with Air Nostrum now and find their flights reasonably enjoyable. Service pleasant and friendly from the FA (coffee served) and flights seem to leave on time. I was very impressed with my check-in at Murcia's small terminal and which involved ticketing right through to Tokyo using Iberia and Japan Airlines connections and the whole process was seamless and efficient. I'm not sure if I like travelling in CRJ 200s that Air Nostrum uses but that may be because on Air Nostrum at least I never seem to be able to get clean windows and am unable to see outside much at all. Do these aircraft ever get cleaned?
3056,MAD-NTE-MAD. We were bussed to the aircraft and boarded very efficiently. The only FA spoke perfect English and Spanish and broken French. CRJ200 series (50 seats) was clean. FA was very friendly. We were served a drink and a packet of nuts and then biscuits and another drink. FA also gave out activity books to kids and newspapers and magazines to passengers as required. Air Nostrum did very well considering Iberia's service.
3057,"SYD-AKL. I was booked in business class on a late afternoon flight. I was informed by the airline that there had been a change and the flight no longer offered business class. Instead I was offered something called World Deluxe Service which is ridiculous and expensive for what it is. Basically it is a fully economy A320 aircraft where the first two rows only use two of the three seats. Essentially someone sits in 1A and 1C but they don't sell 1B. You also get lounge access and the onboard economy meal. I actually had to argue with the booking agent that I was entitled to money back. I had to explain that I had purchased a business class ticket (for myself wife and son) and now that they no longer provided me with business class they actually owed me money. Eventually they relented. The aircraft was absolutely disgusting. It was ancient (or looked ancient). My family was in 1A 1C and 1D (no one was in 1F or in row two at all). There was no divider wall in front of row one so I had to privilege of basically sitting in the galley for three hours watching the flight attendants work. My son was seated in 1C but I had to move him because ""he was too young for an exit row"". Since when is row one an exit row? We were sitting opposite two flight attendants. Wouldn't they operate the door in an emergency? Where they expecting my 9 year old to do it? Air New Zealand's seat selection system is the worst. It is time for the IT department to let you pick specific seats for each passenger instead of picking a block of seats for you. The seats on this aircraft had perhaps a millimetre of recline. It was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have never been on. The entertainment system worked poorly and my son's did not work at all. The only positive is that the Air New Zealand staff are perhaps the nicest people anywhere. I have never had anything but truly outstanding service from the cabin crew on all of my flights with them over the years and this flight was no exception."
3058,"On a 3-hour flight with the flight tracking indicating that we were still 43 minutes out of Sydney the cabin crew issued the tray tables up and seats to upright order with the reason given that we were soon to start our descent into Sydney. This was 25 minutes before the captain issued the ""Cabin Crew prepare the cabin for landing"" instruction. The Air New Zealand aircraft seats are particularly uncomfortable in upright position. On later politely querying why the cabin crew had pre-empted the captain by 25 minutes I was rebuked with the retort that it was a ""courtesy decision"". The only people provided a courtesy by the action were the cabin attendants themselves so they could relax during the rest of the flight."
3059,Travelled LHR/LA 25/12/14. Staff service fair food (veg option) very poor entertainment tired especially movies on offer. London catering needs attention. Big contrast with inward journey 15.1.15 where staff were very good veg option (ex LA) tasty with lots of fresh veg and fruit inflight entertainment also good.
3060,MAD-VAL-MAD. A very satisfactory flying experience with flights leaving on time. Nice comfortable leather seats well turned out and friendly cabin crew who saw to the needs of my grandson by providing a colouring book and pencils. Light refreshments and newspapers were also provided. A pleasant change from flying budget airlines.
3061,Porto-Madrid business class. Ridiculously small space in Business class the same very narrow space as in economy. There are just 8 business class seats but if full as in my case it is no joy at all and the service is poor too. The flight left in time it was short so endurable. On arrival in Madrid the luggage was off-loaded right beside the aircraft and we had to take it from there ourselves.
3062,Gran Canaria - Valencia return. Checked in online in both directions and only had to drop my luggage at the counter. Almost full CRJ 200 and must admit that it was a pleasure to fly with this airline. Comfortable leather seats emergency exit seat so plenty of legroom for a 6'4'' passenger like me (also noticed that the other rows of seats also had above average space) although the seats were a bit narrow due to the width of the plane rather than Air Nostrum seating. The two flight attendants were cheerful and helpful: a sandwich and beer was provided (more than adequate for the time of day and length of flight (2h30m). Infinitely better flight than Iberia via Madrid Air Nostrum will be my airlibne of preference for domestic flights in Spain.
3063,NCE to MAD on a full CRJ-900. Flight left on time even though the plane had two busloads to fill it up. Service not extraordinary. Hostesses served us drinks and cheese sandwiches flight landed on time even though took 30 minutes in order to stop to gate. Good airline worth the price (250 euros return booked 1 month in advance) but do not expect a great service.
3064,VLC-TFN. El aviÃ³n impecable el servicio a bordo adecuado al tamaÃ±o del avion (bocadillos mini y refresco) coste economico y puntual. Este verano repito. Clean airplane the service on board adapted to the size of the airplane (mini sandwiches and refreshment) all at a very good price. This summer I will travel Air Nostrum again.
3065,Flown Air NZ on the MEL-AKL-VAN and return 3 times over the last 2 years and have enjoyed the experience very much flown on both B777-200ER and B777-300 in economy and felt comfortable despite being 6ft 2in. Meals are excellent and so is the service as well as a wide variety of drinks and snacks available throughout the whole flight. Vast entertainment selection with something for everybody. My seat on my recent flight from Auckland to Vancouver had a faulty remote for the entertainment screen and the flight attendant was very helpful in trying to fix the issue whilst we were heading to the runway but couldn't so he said wait till we take off and I could move to another seat that has a working remote and this was the only seat left in economy which had only improved my view on Air NZ.
3066,Flew Air New Zealand in economy from LHR to LAX on their 777-300. Overall it was a good flight - cabin ambience with the mood lighting and black seats was great seat comfort was also good inflight AVOD good food good and friendly flight attendants that came by every 30 minutes or so with water. I would recommend Air New Zealand. The only thing I didn't like was 10 abreast in economy which meant that it was difficult to walk down the aisles without weaving through people's elbows and legs.
3067,I have travelled on Air Nostrum a couple of times and find their service very good. I find it more relaxing than travelling on other airlines. Food consists of a sandwich or cake.
3068,MAD-VLC-MAD in economy. MAD-VLC on Air Nostrum and VLC-MAD on Iberia. Maybe I was lucky but the experience was quite good. The flights both ways were on time and without any unpleasant incident. Connecting from Air Canada (Terminal 1 in Madrid) to Iberia (Terminal 4) was a bit of a trial. It took a good 15 minutes on the shuttle bus much of it on the highway. Air Nostrum used a Bombardier CRJ a bit tight for space. Service on this 50 minute flight exceeded my expectations. No inflight entertainment - none was expected of course given the small plane and short flight. The two FA managed to serve drinks and miniature sandwiches (an almost microscopic bun with a single slice of chorizo inside) although they had to rush to get it done. I was in the last row and the descent to Valencia airport was choppy - felt like a life raft in rough sea! Anyway service was pleasant and I give Air Nostrum full marks. On my return leg on an Iberia Airbus 320 the experience was also quite good although below Air Nostrum. FAs did their job and were reasonably pleasant. Clean plane with 3+3 configuration leather seats with lots of leg room. The flight was only half full and left about 15 minutes late but got to Madrid on time. The downside was absolutely no drinks or snacks of any kind except in business class. There was food for purchase but I didn't see a single person purchasing. No IFE or video demonstration of any kind. I had only carry-on so can't comment on baggage handling. Overall a good experience I would give Air Nostrum 4 star and Iberia 3 star.
3069,MAD-TOU-MAD on CRJ 900. The flight attendants provided a very good service. Even though the flight only lasted 50 minutes they did their very best on this time. The only bad thing was the announcements the flight attendant who was in charge didnÂ´t spoke french. Maybe in flights that go to France they should speak a bit of French.
3070,FRA-ZAR-FRA economy on Air Nostrum for Iberia in mid-June. I was disappointed. The all-economy seating when booking had been altered to mixed configuration business and economy by departure date and the economy passengers seemed to get much poorer service and food than the one or two passengers in the little business class cabin. FAs on all flights also seemed to have a bad case of attitude. Maybe I was having a bad hair day but I found the service poor the flights noisy (in the CRJs) the windows almost impossible to see out of. So I was happy to finally land in Zaragoza and Frankfurt.
3071,MAD-NCE-MAD on Canadair CRJ900 a superb aircraft. It is in a completely different league than the parent company Iberia. A sandwich two small bottles of wine and a coffee on a 1hr 20 run served by friendly professional flight attendants. This is one very good airline and if you dont have to connect onwards onto an IB connection you will enjoy the experience.
3072,AKL-CHC 19 Dec A320. Self service check in bag drop security boarding all uneventful. Seat comfortable enough and FAs smiling friendly seemingly enjoying themselves. We were offered tea coffee or water and choice of a (yes one) biscuit or a little bag of cassava chippies. I don't mind if Air NZ wants to be cheap or save money but I'd like the option to get something a bit better than that even if I have to pay. Some years ago I regularly flew with Air NZ WLG-AKL and they used to provide a full cooked breakfast and substantial snacks during the rest of the day . Disappointed with the change. Toilet was spotless but nothing else was. Bulkheads arm rest seat back seat all filthy. Noting has been dusted for an age let alone wiped down. Gross. We hit turbulence en route and gratefully the pilot managed to drop us down below it. Baggage misdirected at CHC so took almost an hour to retrieve it. Ground staff were aware of this but surprisingly didn't bother to tell anyone we had to go find them. Little competition appears to not have done anyone any favours and so will have to fly them again. Oh well. Word of caution...Always use the NZ website to book flights. When Iwent to book my multi drop NZ itinerary on their UK website only the full fat (most expensive) fare was offered. I switched to the NZ site and saved several hundred dollars.
3073,"NZ 879 CHC-OOL A320. Paid for ""works"". Awful (dry) food which lack any imagination water served in plastic cups no inflight magazine no sick bags no head phones so had to wait for them to arrive before I could use the entertainment system. The entertainment system had very limited selection of movies scrolling between screens was slow to navigate and the whole thing seemed counter-intuitive. When on Emirates you get an entertainment guide/magazine which allows you to view the selection of movies at a glance with Air NZ you need to slowly scroll through each page of movies. Hostesses rather than being professional were trying to be too friendly/familiar - the ""kiwi"" way does not automatically equate to being professional. Really poor work Air NZ regret using you."
3074,Air New Zealand may well win awards for international services but the customer care when dealing with people when flights are cancelled on domestic routes leaves a lot to be desired. Our flight to New Plymouth was unable to land due to low cloud and we returned to Auckland we were told there would no more flights that day and we were rebooked on an early morning flight there was no offer of accommodation or alternative ground transport despite a lot requests for a coach to be laid on we were left at 7pm in Auckland airport with nowhere to stay no offer of any assistance whatsoever. This is the problem when you have a monopoly on regional air services take it or leave it.
3075,Flew HKG-AKL-CHC then AKL-YVR with Air NZ as part of a round-the-world itinerary. Their service is second-to-none even in economy. One of the flights was on a refitted B777-200ER and although narrower the new-style seat was very comfortable and I slept well in it.
3076,Tangiers-Barcelona on a Canadair operated by Air Nostrum - way better than Iberia its higher class and service is also better than Iberia. The whole plane was business class.
3077,Basel via Barcelona to Granada. The flights between Basel and Barcelona were operated by Air Nostrum although sadly since they've stopped flying to Basel. I think their service is nothing short of amazing. First of all on the return we were even given a hot meal. This was in economy class and the flight is less than two hours. Generally the quality of the food is good and the service in economy class is more like what you get in Business class on most airlines. The flight attendants were very friendly which only made the contrast to the surly unfriendly bunch working for Iberia seem even more unfriendly.
3078,4th Nov NZ 175. We flew from Auckland to Perth in the excellent new Dreamliner - what a plane! The seats were the best business class seats we have had the pleasure of traveling in so far. The entertainment system was superb and very easy to use. The food was 5 star restaurant quality and as usual great friendly staff. We were amazed to how great we felt after a 7 hour flight and the hostess said that is because of the cabin pressure in the new Dreamliners we have had no jet lag and slipped into Perth time straight away. Can't wait for our return flight home!
3079,NZ734 BNE-AKL 5 Nov 14. Seat only flight good on time good crew IFE fine but no laptop power and buy on board food is poor. I usually fly QF but their plane was full and this was the best bet but it wasn't cheap. While unbundling is sensible the inability to get a decent meal is not. The only way to get a meal is to buy the Works which is not economic for a hand luggage only or day trip passenger. Air NZ is not an LCC so shouldn't act like one. It can do better.
3080,12/10 NZ135 AKL-BNE. A disappointing Business Class experience. Whilst the cabin and seats were nice the staff attitude was poor - surly and pretentious attitude that revolves around them rather than the passenger. Distasteful bragging about wining various airline awards - but with little evidence of such justification. Offered champagne at 09.30 in the morning was inappropriate followed by food that was inedible. All in all poor value for money in comparison to other airlines that offer a far superior attentive service.
3081,I flew LHR-LAX and LAX-LHR with my daughter in rows 36H an 36J (preferred seating). I booked Air New Zealand as a result of the good price I got (Â£518 return) but the experience was such that I would definitely use them on this route instead of Virgin or BA. The food and wine selection was better than most airline food I have eaten except perhaps Turkish Airlines. The aircraft on the outward journey was only 2 weeks old and immaculate. The returning flight was in Lord of the Rings Livery and was also a pretty new aircraft. Upon first glance the seats seem quite narrow but sometimes looks deceive and I found the seating very comfortable. I accept that I had no seat in front of me but my daughter who had a seat in front of her was pretty comfortable despite being quite tall. The only negative with the Boeing 777-300 in this layout is the very narrow aisle but it's not a deal breaker for me. However the best thing about Air New Zealand were the staff friendly helpful and professional on both legs of the flight.
3082,MEL-WEL-CHC-MEL. One of the best economy class trips - smooth and efficient. Arrived in Wellington early. Staff really good. Surprisingly the Airbus 320 was very comfortable. No food if you are on a budget air-ticket. Highly recommended.
3083,We booked an infant fare with Air NZ for a flight from Auckland to London and had to pay an extra $100 each leg to access a bassinet seat. The infant fare also doesn't include checked luggage which meant we had to spend another $155 each leg for 23kgs of luggage. Compare this to Qantas where both the 'extras' of the bassinet seat and 23kgs luggage were included as part of the fare. Overall we had to spend $255 extra on each leg for an infant to travel on top of a relatively high base fare. When I discussed this with AirNZ customer service they indicated the cabin luggage limit of 7kgs should be perfectly fine for travelling long haul with an infant obviously never travelled with a child. Very disappointed with Air NZ's approach to infant travel as well as the response of the customer service representative.
3084,We flew twice with Air NZ this month once from Vancouver to Auckland and once from Auckland to Hong Kong. On each occasion we were really impressed by the service. The food was great (more than I could eat on on occasion) the sensitivity to those wanting to sleep and those wanting to be provided food and or drink was terrific and the smiles seemed to be genuine (even at the end of a long haul flight - some achievement). We flew Economy Class Air NZ in 2008 and had the same superb service. It's not what you pay it's who you fly with and Air NZ is in the very top shelf.
3085,Air New Zealand - NZ5 LAX to AKL. Poor customer service poor communications. Poor seating. What more can I say but poor. What is the point of preferred seating with airlines if they then change the aircraft type and do not move the allocated passenger seating around. I am well over 6 foot with a minor back injury and had booked an exit seat over 9 months in advance so that I could have a bit of comfort. It appears that the aircraft type was changed out of LAX but this was not passed on to the passengers so when we boarded I found my 'exit' seat was now stuck in the middle of the aircraft. Even with the seat in front of me fully raised I could not sit with my legs straight in front rather splayed either side. When the seat was reclined I had no space at all and the insides of my knees were constantly rubbing against the seat in front and it meant that my knees were encroaching on the passenger next to me. Also the media screen is then just inches from you and is pretty useless to view. Have never had this issue with Singapore or Emirates and as the national carrier and not a budget airline I would expect better from them.
3086,Flew from Sydney to Auckland in Economy Class which was perfectly satisfactory. We then flew on from Auckland to San Francisco using Premium Economy Class which we thought was excellent. The new style seats were very spacious and well laid out (perhaps the seat could have slid forward a bit more?). Good service; good food and a superb range of movies and TV channels etc. made for a comfortable relaxing flight and other airlines could do worse than copy this benchmark. I would recommend this service.
3087,NZ 7 San Francisco to Auckland 30th September 2014. Traveled on a leg of a round trip holiday to US from Australia. Pre-flight announcement advised potential problems with the entertainment system on the 777-200 and not fixed by the time we took off. After a number of attempts to reset at the start of the flight the crew gave up and I endured 13+ hours with nothing to distract while jammed in one of the worst economy class seats (47F). A very unpleasant flight. Even in the 70s you got an inflight movie! Food was much worse than other Air New Zealand legs flown. Staff were good and full of apologies but this does not excuse poor maintenance.
3088,LHR-AKL via LAX and return; premium economy. It's obvious that a lot of thought has gone into the design of the premium economy seats. There is a lot to like particularly the legroom the extra bits of storage space and general layout of the seats. Where they fail is with the reclining system. It allows you to incline your lower body but what's needed to place people for sleep is a facility to lower your head. In that respect the traditional tilt-back seats were vastly better despite the problems they can cause for other passengers who don't want to sleep. By airline standards food and drink were excellent on all four legs. Service too was great but why can't drinks as well as small pieces of food be left out for pickup between meal services? The entertainment system was OK but lacking in recent blockbuster movies. I was glad I paid the extra for premium economy but found it very hard to sleep in these upright pod seats.
3089,LHR-LAX and return in Sept. Excellent flight on fairly new B777-300 out leg very good in Premium Economy. Cabin crew outstanding both legs food excellent. Both flights ahead of schedule. Only small negative comment would be onboard entertainment particularly the movies none of which I would describe as mainstream. Nevertheless would not hesitate to recommend ANZ. Well done to them!
3090,We flew Business Class from Auckland to Hong Kong and was a wonderful experience. I have recently flown long-haul Business on Cathay and Emirates and the Air NZ lie-flat bed is far better then anything else I have seen. Food was great.
3091,"Staff professional and impeccable service during the flight. Very tasty food served, 3 announcements were made by the cockpit during the flight. Landed in Belgrade with a minor 15-20 min delay. The only negative would be that during boarding there was no priority boarding call and no express boarding line for business passengers."
3092,HK to AKL Business Class 15 Sept 2014. New updated 777-200 for one of its first flights on the route. Generally a smooth ANZ service with the staff obviously enjoying the new updated plane. The seats etc were very much like the 777-300ER with updated touch screen movies much improved than the old toggle system. Great updated menu from Peter Gordon more interesting meals. Delay due to weather that held us on the tarmac before departure but they were flexible and let people up are around to the bathrooms despite having left the gate. Hard to fault a new internal refreshed interior and great staff.
3093,Got upgraded to business class on the Auckland-Apia (Samoa) flight. Although these seats are the old style recliner type they were comfortable enough for the 4 hour flight. Cabin staff were excellent. Had the bacon roll for breakfast great taste. Flew back a week later in economy on an Airbus. As always flying Air NZ is a great experience.
3094,"We arrived late to Belgrade and had 20 minutes until our next flight. Everything was organised and Air Serbia managed to get our bags on time all the way to Beirut. Exceeded my expectations. Great flight, friendly staff."
3095,"Took an evening flight with Air Serbia from Vienna to Bucharest via Belgrade. The flight was in a relatively small turbo-prop aircraft. I had a seat on the front with no one next to me, I also had about half a metre of leg space which was brilliant. Cabin crew very friendly and talkative, as it was a short hop I ended up talking with one of the stewardesses and a man on the opposite row about travel/politics for the entire flights. I would fly again."
3096,"Copenhagen-Belgrade-Thessaloniki 14th June. Smooth flights with good service. On first leg, three course menu. Beverages, wine and beer for free. Second leg under 1 hour, they served a baguette and drinks. Clean planens on both legs and good information from cockpit. Seat pitch ok, standard."
3097,AKL to SFO 777 300ER. Great flight with a very friendly and efficient cabin crew. Food was extremely good and nicely presented. Aircraft was fairly new clean with comfortable flat beds. A very enjoyable flight. This was a vastly better experience than our next leg with British Airways.
3098,YVR to AKL 777-200ER. Another excellent flight with Air New Zealand. The cabin crew were great and made the flight very enjoyable. Food was great and nicely presented. The aircraft was fairly old but was clean and everything worked as it should. The entertainment system could do with an upgrade to content performance and display quality. The Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge at Vancouver that Air New Zealand uses is quite poor.
3099,I was on Flight 791 from Auckland to Adelaide it left at 8am on the 9th September the cabin crew were exceptional in their help to me and my partner she had a pinched nerve in her spine and they were brilliant in their attitude. I will always fly New Zealand in the future.
3100,Over the past few months I have done long haul return flights in Premium Economy on Qantas Cathay and British Airways and Business Class on Singapore Airlines. I was flying from Sydney to San Francisco (via Auckland and LA) and the flight segment yesterday in Air New Zealand Premium Economy (space seats) from Auckland to Los Angeles was vastly better than all the other airline's Premium Economy. The seats are wonderfully designed spacious and comfortable with ample surrounding space. I loved the large pillow and even got a second one for extra comfort. In fact (even though the seats don't lie flat) the whole premium economy cabin with mood lighting and great layout looked better than the business class cabin. The toilet area was huge always spotless and I loved the whimsical 'bookcase'! The amenity pack was welcome with Clarins creams and cute stripy socks and eye mask with funny message on it. The entertainment selection (with noise cancelling headphones) was huge - really something for everyone - and a big screen with multiple angles for comfortable viewing. The service from 2 male flight attendants was outstanding and the meals were absolutely delicious by any (not just airline) standard. I think the food is the same as in Business Class - for dinner I had figs olives and proscuiito as a starter salmon in a crust with bean puree and spinach lemon tart camomile tea and chocolates (with sparkling wine and NZ Shiraz) breakfast was muesli with yoghurt cheese and mushroom omelette with tomato concasse coffee etc. I have often flown business and first class on other airlines - I can honestly say that if I could fly to all the destination I need to go on Air NZ Premium Economy (space seats) it would always be my first choice. A superb product.
3101,It was a very nice flight with no delays from either Sofia and Belgrade. Decent airplanes with polite staff. Good food on board but lack of inflight entertainment. Not much space for legs but for short flights so it's not such a problem. Good airline.
3102,"TLV-BEG-AMS-BEG-TLV in May 2015. All flights operated by A319 last segment BEG-TLV by Aviolet B737-300. The highlight of this airline is the crew. Very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Smiles all around and good grooming. Seating is very tight no legroom and if no empty seat next to you its torture. No IFE of any sort. Food described as ""Gourmet"" in their literature. Gourmet is the last word that can describe their food. Very basic more like hospital food but their fares are very good so any amenities are a plus. Staff in BEG were kind as well. Flight from/to AMS late an hour each way but that's possible with any airline. All in all a good airline good rates but luckily most of their flights are short (2.5hr max) so the tight seating is manageable."
3103,I wanted to reschedule my tickets to Belgrade and it was done quickly and smoothly. The whole procedure took five minutes on the phone and the customer support answered my emailed questions in a matter of a few hours. Staff have a great level of English and are friendly. The service and food on board flight are excellent as well.
3104,Flew SYD-AKL-LAX and return in August/September 2014. SYD-AKL was on the new 787 Dreamliner. Was excellent for the short trip although had to move to Economy for take off and landing due to no seat belt extension onboard. The IFE is new and much quicker to respond than the older style. It is more an app-style interface which was easier to use and less clunky. AKL-LAX was same reliable service from Air NZ. Helpful efficient mature staff with excellent food and comfortable seat/bed. Amenity pack is cheap and nasty compared with days past and no pyjamas compared with other airlines at the same or cheaper price point. Lounge in Auckland is good but always crowded lounge in Sydney is worn and needs a furniture update but still perfectly fine to kill the hours before your flight. Lounge staff in LAX are not up to the usual Air NZ standard but the drink selection is good the air- conditioning is cold and the food selection though limited is enough to satisfy for a snack. The showers were not up to the standard of lounges such as Virgin Atlantic and even Swiss International but ok to freshen up before the flight. The 777-300 packs a lot of people into Business class and the staff do seem to take longer than previously. The 767 seats in business are absolutely abysmal and even with the best will in the world I find it impossible to say anything good about them. Overall Air NZ is a very good airline with good staff great food and innovative product. The sooner they lose their 767 business seat the better though. Also if you're planning onward travel in USA do it yourself. There are so many better options available than the alliance offered by Air NZ with United.
3105,30-31st August. I was meant to have flown with Air New Zealand from Los Angeles to Heathrow but they ran out of seats and over booked the flights. So I'm now leaving a day later. I was quite upset to have been told there were not enough seats for me but the compensation came as a surprise. They offered me night over in a hotel with dinner lunch and breakfast included and to top it off cash to keep me going. So I'm very thankful for that and very impressed in the way they handled the situation. I have been guaranteed a seat on the same flight but a day later.
3106,FCO-BEG-AUH Economy. Clean aircraft friendly staff good food excellent service. Our first flight FCO-BEG was late because of fog at BEG but we were immediately assisted at the gate and escorted until boarded the connecting flight. Unfortunately one of our luggage was lost and arrived only two days later. Great assistance from their customer service. Recommended.
3107,VIE-BEG-VIE (JU 601 on ATR72 and JU 604 on B733) I must say Air Serbia has one of the best economy products in Europe at the moment when it comes to service food and beverages and staff attitude. Cabin crew were very friendly on both flights. On each of these 1 hour flights they served a paper bag with a tasty sandwich cookie and a bottle of water. In addition there even was a wide selection of drinks coffee and tea - all for free in economy in 2015! The ATR72 aircraft was a bit noisy the 733 was much better 30 year old workhorse but refurbished and nice for a change as 733s have become rare in Europe these days. All in all I was very satisfied and will fly Air Serbia again there are good connections and competitive fares from VIE.
3108,I had 4 flights with JU the route was BUD-BEG-ATH-BEG-BUD. I must say that I was totally satisfied with the airline. As I was reading the reviews here before my trip I was a little bit worried whether it was worth booking with Air Serbia but in the end I had no doubts that the airline made a huge improvement in order to provide a satisfying service for the passengers. The flights between Budapest and Belgrade were operated with ATR 72 aircraft's which were quite uncomfortable but it was alright for that 1 hr 5 mins of flight time. The surprising thing was that a little paper bag with a sandwich and a bottle of water was provided and they also served coffee and tea onboard. Belgrade Airport was okay however the WiFi was didn't work for me. The flights between Belgrade and Athens were operated with an Airbus A319. The seats were as comfortable as onboard of Lufthansa and it beats Finnair in comfort and onboard service. Another paper bag was provided during the flight with a fine sandwich cookie and a bottle of water. We could also ask from a wide range of beverages coke juices beer and wines. The 1 hr 15 mins flight was smooth in both ways. The crew was extremely helpful and nice thus I can say that the impact of Etihad Airways is clearly visible! If you are willing to travel to the Balkans or to Southern Europe don't hesitate to choose Air Serbia it's totally worth its price. (Which was even the cheapest option in case of my Budapest-Athens trip).
3109,Flew from Auckland to Vancouver. It was a tired old plane and the movie selection was pretty tired also. Food was ok but a second cup of tea was hard to obtain. The cabin was clean. The seat was adequate. Crew members were amiable. The guy in the aisle seat had no where else to put his long legs he seemed about 6 foot six inches tall except in the aisle which was not good for anybody. It was part of a round the world fare and did not seem great value to me. Next time I will check a direct flight to LHR our final destination and side trips from there.
3110,AKL to Apia return on NZ 992/991 for a four day trip travelling only with hand luggage. Web checked the first flight and went straight to lounge prior to boarding. Lounge busy but kept clear of passengers used dishes. Good selection of food available lounge attendants efficient as was the barista in making me a great macchiato! Flights themselves were generally excellent. Crew friendly and efficient both ways. Not much to say about return flight as leaves Apia at 0150hrs arriving 0500hrs but had a whole row to stretch out in to sleep. Early arrival home and outside terminal in 10 minutes after landing. Excellent value for money. Look forward to me next trip.
3111,I was booked to fly on NZ103 from Auckland to Sydney having not long arrived on NZ5 from LAX. We were supposed to be flying on a 777-200 but Air NZ had changed this to a brand new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. What a bonus that turned out to be the aircraft was almost empty I had a whole three seat row to myself in the rear cabin and the new aircraft was absolutely brilliant to fly on. The seats are very much the same as the ones on the 777-300 but with a newer entertainment system and with bigger windows that tint rather than have a shade to pull down. Really enjoyed this flight look forward to flying on a Dreamliner again soon.
3112,ZRH-BEG-OTP-BEG-ZRH: Nice hardware (A319/A320) with very good sets great pitch and on each leg a salami sandwich not very creative and therefore not convincing food although the cookies changed. Cabin personnel friendly but big difference between the announcements in Serbian and English. But for a very competitive price not that bad. Plane for the last leg arrived at time in BEG crew boarded but disembarked 5 minutes before boarding. A plane from Aviolot (their charter company) was brought to the next gate flight was delayed for an hour. Actually no problem rather fly late but with a working plane. Information in English were only given to Biz pax and Serbian speakers which were asked to contact the service desk one after the other. The information letter in English was only handed out at boarding. Simply full of lies: 1) late incoming plane as reason delayed start and landing times wrong cited (so less than 2 hours although it was more writing about refreshments you would have been able to ask for during waiting time but none was brought to the small boarding area). Shame on Air Serbia and shame on Etihad Preferred Guest Partner Airlines if this is the customer relation attitude!
3113,What a pleasant surprise that was. Flew from Budapest to Abu-Dhabi via Belgrade then changed to Etihad Airways. Planes were nice and tidy while flight attendants were helpful. Sleeping was flawless occupying the empty seats next to me. Meals could have been better as the sandwich were a bit dry but the cooked meal was alright. There is no entertainment system in their fleet so I would recommend you to bring your own tablet notebook.
3114,Flew Bucharest - Stockholm via Belgrade with Air Serbia on a snowy Monday in February. Both flights operated with Airbus 319. Fresh cabins perfect service. A little late on departure from Romania but landed on time. Short transit in Belgrade. Smooth with no problems. Excellent service onboard. Snacks and beverages on the short flight full hot meal with wine served on the flight to Stockholm (free!). Just like flying used to be in the 80s!
3115,I am a Qantas Platinum but decided to try something different. Flew Air New Zealand from Melbourne - Auckland and then Auckland - Los Angeles - both legs in business class. Had issue with bags as initially they refused to transfer them from one flight to another because they were separate tickets meaning I would have only 1 hour 50 minutes to go through NZ immigration/customs and then recheck for the LA flight. I was astounded and eventually they relented agreeing to do it making it clear that it was only because I was in business class. Cabin crew on both legs were great food was excellent. Disliked the herringbone window seat arrangements as made it hard to see out of the windows. My allocated seat was not available as it had malfunctioned so they had seated me in another next to the galley which I objected to. I was then moved to another seat but the gate agent did not tell me that this too was near a galley. Not impressed! The seat on the AKL-LAX leg was comfortable but just not up to scratch. If you wanted to lie flat you had get out of the seat and then it was folded down and a mattress put on top. This means you could not sit up easily during the night as to sit up the mattress had to be removed and the seat unfolded and returned to an upright or semi-reclined position. Kind of all or nothing! Lack of storage in seat area. Would I fly Air NZ again? Only if the price was right.
3116,PPT-AKL- MEL (NZ41-overnight flight short layover at AKL followed by NZ123) July 11-12. Both flights on B777-300. PPT airport facilities and Business Class lounge basic AKL Business Class lounge fully stocked yet overcrowded. Flight PPT-MEL: aircraft in pristine condition full flat beds mattress duvet pillow amenity kit provided. Flight attendants explained in detail use of seat controls and provided a full turn-down service to each one of the passengers shortly after take-off. Humoristic and original safety instructions video. Breakfast was served some two hours before landing - adequate quantity good quality yet nothing impressive. Lavatories clean. Cabin crew very professional. Transtasman flight AKL-MEL: This service was not at the same standard as the previous. My seat - and several others - did not function at all flight attendant had to restart them. Cabin crew more distant restrained and not at the same professional level than in the previous flight. Food and beverages average. IFE system had plenty of choices. Arrived on time. One of my suitcases was partially damaged yet ANZ in MEL arranged for its free repair. In conclusion these flights were certainly not equal in quality : the PPT-AKL was a four-to-five stars service the AKL-MEL a three-to-four stars service leaving lots to be improved.
3117,AKL to YVR (return). On both flights the food was average and only two meals not even a snack for Lunch prior to arriving in YVR. The plane was in need of a refit. The entertainment (systems) both choice and operation was rubbish system crashed jumped and skipped so I gave up. Second major item was the Gate staff at YVR. 4 of them and two only checked in the gold/priority customers leaving the other two to check in 300+ others. All in all not impressed.
3118,JU414 and JU 415. Belgrade-Stockholm-Belgrade 22 and 26 January. Could not be faulted in any way. Excellent drinks snacks and food. Good wines (was offered to try both Serbian ones excellent). Flights on time. Five star experience!
3119,JU305 on 23 January - BRU-BEG. Check-in chaos as a huge group of pushy people crowded the desks - but the agents kept them in line luckily. Boarding was organized and began 35 minutes before scheduled departure time. Flight was packed but ended up with an empty middle seat next to me! Flight attendants welcomed all passengers with a smile and small talk (I don't speak Serbian and I'd say 95% of the passengers were Serbian) but they were all fluent in English. Departed 5 minutes early and nice 1 hour 50 minute flight. Menus were handed out in coach and a yummy chicken or beef dinner was served. Seats were a little hard but for 2 hours who cares. Landed and luggage was on the belt within 5 minutes after going through immigration. Really enjoyed the flight and service. If they do begin Transatlantic flights and have modern equipment and similar service - they will do well. Looking forward to my return to Brussels.
3120,JU827 JU826 JU610. Aug 4 2014 and Aug 11 2014. Will never fly with Air Serbia again. Service bad late planes. Me and my husband traveled from Beirut to Prague we landed in Belgrade and had delays both ways. First trip from Beirut was delayed 2 hours so we had to run to catch our flight to Belgrade. I asked 3 times if our luggage was coming with us I got the same answer - yes . When we landed in Prague it was as I suspected our luggage didn't follow with us. It took us an additional 2 hours to fix everything before we could go to our hotel. The food was very bad service was bad - I asked for a blanket that they didn't give me.
3121,AMS-BEG. In October I flew from Belgrade to Amsterdam and back. I really enjoyed my flight. Food was excellent really rare are companies that offer you a menu in economy class on short-haul flight which was the case with Air Serbia. In menu was appetizer main course dessert and wide choice of drinks beginning with all types of juices to various types of wine and whiskey. Also you can choose the main course. The plane was Airbus A319 seats were comfortable and stuff very friendly and kind. I'd fly with Air Serbia again.
3122,Consistently excellent. Staff always really genuinely friendly (or outstanding actors/actresses!). Food and wine good or excellent. Cuddle class is a revelation only used it once. Business fantastic but economy good too. Respond to e-mails very quickly phone support also good.
3123,Flew from Auckland to Nadi in late July on an A320. Flight left on time and arrived in Nadi earlier due to a tail wind. We had a works ticket which meant we got a meal which I was very impressed with. Never knew airline food could be so good. Flight attendants as always very friendly. My only complaint is the seating of this plane. It is very squashed and the seats seemed very uncomfortable. I had difficulty eating my meal as I was in the centre seat and just really had no room for my arms. The seat was so uncomfortable that I had a slight back ache in my lower back. A terrible plane really. Would avoid a A320 in the future if I could.
3124,Flying home from Nadi to Auckland with a connecting flight to Kerikeri as we live in the Far North. On arrival at Nadi Airport we were told the plane had been upgraded from a 777 to a 747 which was the first clue to a problem as that is a much larger plane. Boarding time was 1.30pm and that came with the announcement to board so we waited at the appropriate gate and then everyone disappeared and then the announcement that there was going to be a delay. An hour delay as it turned out. Not sure why we were not told earlier about this as someone would have known but we weren't. At that time we knew we would miss our connecting flight which was the last one for that day. The steward on the plane came round to people with connecting flights to try to help us and he said that we should make it no problems and if not they could put us on a flight to Whangarei not sure how as there were none to Whangarei that day and there was no way of making that last flight as by the time you have collected your baggage (we were waiting for bags at precisely the time our connecting flight took off) and got through customs there was no chance. So we were put up for the night and booked on a flight the next day to Kerikeri but when we got to the airport the next day someone had decided to take us off that flight! The flight itself was good food was good although the drinks cart was way behind the food arriving. Staff were pleasant except for the false information and this plane had plenty of room. Air New Zealand is usually good to fly with and yes things can go wrong. But lack of communication and competence of some staff really made for a terrible end to a great holiday. I would say I would never fly them again but we don't have many choices in New Zealand and they are really the lesser of the other evils!
3125,CDG-ATH-SKG-CDG round trip. What a lovely airline! All flights with very comfortable seat. Cabin crews were very professional and were always present. At CDG our flight was delayed. The purser was very helpful and gave us all information and we didn't miss the connecting flight. air Serbia offers a very good product. Good food good choice of drinks - excellent value for money.
3126,I flew from Podgorica Montenegro to Belgrade and than Belgrade to Banja Luka. Even though they were ATR 72 airplanes (rather modest in size) I have to say that I had an extremely pleasant experience. Those ATRs looked very good renewed clean warm and pleasant. Flights were on time and according to the schedule staff were extremely polite and helpful. They looked (at least to me) new and with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. There was a meal served (these are 50 minutes flights i.e. rather short) with beverages and that was very refreshing. Excellent and I would recommend them.
3127,An absolute surprise! I flew from Belgrade to London on a Sunday morning and was expecting something pretty awful Instead I would rate it as the best European flight I have taken in the past year! Maybe it has something to do with Air Serbia's link up with Etihad but in any case the staff were pleasant I was offered a choice of hot main meal in economy there was plenty of leg room and the flight left and arrived on time. Couldn't ask for more!
3128,Flew BEG-WAW and BEG-AUH. Both flights excellent service crew very professional and polite food excellent interior of the plane fresh and new big improvement! Probably the best service at the moment amongst European carriers.
3129,"MEL-WLG. Flight left on time and was 20 minutes shorter than planned. Seats were great and I had plenty of leg room (I am 6'5"") I had an exit seat thinking there would be more but they were all the same on the A320. I was disappointed that I was not given a meal after paying for a full fare ticket and therefore had to purchase snacks (most of which had sold out already which is highly frustrating). Inflight entertainment was also not included this was $10 per movie which I thought was extremely overpriced! Luckily I put some things on my phone to watch. Some staff were friendly some not so. Free water/tea/coffee - but you get that on any airline. Overall happy but there could be improvements."
3130,Recently had to be diverted from Queenstown to Christchurch due to extremely high winds trying to land in Queenstown. Once in Christchurch Air New Zealand staff were excellent they arranged and paid for accommodation the shuttle to get to the hotel and breakfast the following morning. They then notified us at our hotels about our flight that had been arranged the following day and then collected us all by shuttle to get us back to the airport on time. We had a smooth flight into Queenstown the following day. The situation was handled extremely well.
3131,I flew HKG to AKL with Air NZ. Having flown Cathay Pacific on three long haul sectors I was looking forward to the flight. I was so disappointed and astounded how bad their business class product has become. Both the food and wine were not up to standard. The Airshow system was not working and the entertainment choices were very poor. The seats are not lie flat until you complete something akin to a military exercise to set up a bed with a mattress. Cost cutting measures are so evident as even the bread rolls look smaller and the hot face towels given to you look like they have been cut in half. The four flight stewards did their best but who on earth decided to dress them in tight waist coats and aprons? Other airlines I have flown provide a far better level of service at a lower fare and I will not be flying Air New Zealand again on their long haul sectors as I do not think they look after their business class passengers like other airlines. Their tenure as a 4 star airline must be looking very shaky indeed.
3132,BEG-IST (August 2014) - Boarding at Belgrade airport was on time flight was on time (operated with new Airbus A320) very comfortable for this short relation and I must say nice cabin crew members. Food is basic but still this is a very short flight to expecting more than sandwich cookies and coffee. When we arrived at Istanbul (Ataturk) airport all luggage was there. I can recommend Air Serbia for a flight to Istanbul.
3133,BEG-ARN-BEG. Like flying with two different companies. On the first flight to Stockholm it felt like Fawlty Towers on a plane and the purser played the fictional character Manuel. If he could get something wrong he did. The aperitif and nuts came with the main meal ?œbecause it is more convenient?? Announcements made on board not understandable because of the poor English spoken in a very fast way. Even though the incompetence of the purser was kind of entertaining from occasionally the whole experience was a disappointment. However things could not have been better than the return flight to Belgrade. Excellent purser and staff who made everything right and could not be more accommodating. Thumbs up! Strangely enough though no champagne offered before takeoff but has to be asked for. Food tasteful but the main dishes slightly dry.
3134,First time I flew with Air Serbia from Brussels to Athens via Belgrade. Both flights departed late. But the service in Business Class was amazing. The best business class flight in EU-EU flights for sure. There were only 8 business class seats and on the first flight I was alone so the flight attendant was all mine.
3135,PRG-BEG BEG-VIE - operated by older ATR planes little bit noisy but ok BEG-LCA IST-BEG - operated by Airbus airplanes - new comfortable. During 3 flights snack served (sandwich cookie small bottle of water + another drink - very enough for such short flights) to LCA meal served (salad meal dessert). One hour delay to LCA (30mins to solve the problem that 2 passengers had same seat on their boarding card) the other flights on time. On way from IST to VIE we had about 1 hour to change in Belgrade it was enough even for our luggage so don't worry. For money they asked for all tickets they offered more than I expected. I would fly with Air Serbia again.
3136,We flew AUH-SEZ and return on Air Seychelles operated by Etihad Aircraft. The flights were both very empty with no more that 35 passengers on each sector. The flights left on time or even 30 minutes early as we found when leaving Victoria. The crew on both sectors were very friendly and professional. The quality of food was good on all flights and the crew continued to come round with water throughout the night. The entertainment was from Etihad's ebox selection which was very good and had an up to date film television and music selection on demand.
3137,"We flew round trip AKL to PPT. Our trip started with a 2 hour delay which was poorly communicated. They claimed it was due to a ""seat"" which needed to be repaired. This delay caused us a lot of trouble and extra cost as we missed our connection that night as well as first nights accommodation on an island resort - not cheap. The flight was uncomfortable at 5+ hours on an old 767 which was unclean. The guide in the seat pocket was full of chewing gum. Furthermore the volume on the safety video was so loud that passengers had to cover their ears. The video in general was also excessively long overly animated and ridiculous. Our second flight with ANZ we were already completely put off by this video and found it annoying. The crew served water from an unclean looking plastic pitcher. Never seen this on an airline before not even on a low cost carrier. Furthermore the audacity that ANZ charges a hefty membership ""fee"" to join their frequent flyer programme - first time hearing about this."
3138,NZ-2 LAX-LHR. Worst airline selection I have ever made. I should have gone with either Virgin Atlantic or BA. The economy section in the 777-300 is a complete joke. I know Air New Zealand is making extra money by having 10 seats across in economy but at what cost? I will never fly with them again and I am sure many other passengers who experience this economy section feel the same way. I really felt like a sardine packed in a can in that airplane. To make matters worse there was no individual airflow control. The plane was hot the whole flight to the point you were sweating in your seat. The only positive was that I had a friendly flight attendant who gave me free drinks towards the end of the flight because she felt so bad for the people on the plane.
3139,"Flew AKL-LAX-LHR and back 30th June out 14th July return. I had a seat each for me and my two kids both under 5. All of the crews were fantastic with them going out of their way to assure our comfort. The crew as we approached LHR were exceptional and took the initiative of laying on a ""Meet & Assist"" at LHR which was such a help and a great touch. Check in at AKL was brilliant abysmal at LHR but that was the only down point of an otherwise excellent trip. Kids loved the most of the food though spaghetti is a tough one to feed a toddler on a plane! Didn't get a chance to test the TV I grabbed sleep when the kids slept!"
3140,"Heathrow to LA in Economy. This was my first and last time flying with Air NZ. Firstly the best aspect was the crew friendliness. They seem good fun and genuinely happy to help. The ones I chatted to really hate the 777-300 aircraft. One said it wasn't designed to 4 seats in middle row and she seemed genuinely sorry for the customers squashed in a middle seat. A result of having an extra seat in the middle has meant that the aisles have got narrower. I really felt sorry for the crew having to walk sideways a lot of the time. I was in an aisle seat and was constantly being bashed by the crew and passengers waking past. Clearly they are trying to squeeze out as much profit at the expense of customer comfort. I paid extra for a ""preferred seat"" and apparently this includes a row behind a leg room seat. Not sure why I had to pay extra for this seat that was no different to any other regular row. When the guy in front put his seat back I felt so claustrophobic and could hardly see my TV screen. The food was very average and I waited over 80 minutes to be served an alcoholic drink with my meal. Being offered a glass of tap water just after take-off is very poor and not what you'd expect from a very expensive ""4 star airline."" The choice of films is very limited and very few new titles. I'll most certainly be flying on BA A380 next time I go to LA."
3141,BEG-ATH JU512 A320. Very professional staff food is ok. We landed on time. I was pleased and will fly Air Serbia from now on.
3142,Flew to BEG August 23rd and back to STR on Monday 25th. Flight numbers JU341 and JU344. I've recently been flying Air Serbia from STR to BEG and BEG to STR in business class. Although the outbound flight was the old JAT Boeing 737 it has truly been the greatest business class experience I've enjoyed onboard a European airline. Very friendly supportive and attentive cabin crew. On the A319 spacious and comfortable new business class seats (only two rows in the front section so a very private atmosphere). Very tasty F&B (especially the chocolate cake). Last but not least a service of drink refills without any demand from the passengers with a good offering of elegant Serbian wines. I truly recommend this airline!
3143,JU415 JU826 JU827 JU410. Will never fly with Air Serbia again. Service bad late planes. Me and my wife traveled to Beirut from Stockholm we landed in Belgrade and had delays both ways - we had time between the planes - 45 min. First trip to Beirut was delayed 3 hours second trip back to Stockholm was late to Belgrade so we had to run to the plane and then we just sat there for 50 mins until the plane took off. I asked 3 times if our luggage was coming with us I got the same answer - we don't know. When we landed it was as I suspected our luggage didn't follow with us. It took us an additional 2 hours to fix everything before we could go home.
3144,I booked Air Serbia for a flight from VIE to ATH via BEG and enjoyed a comfortable stay onboard. The aircraft's were clean and the seats seemed to be quite new. The catering-concept with paper bags filled with a sandwich a cookie and a bottle of water was very good as you already had something to drink and did not have to wait for the drinks that were served afterwards. All in all it was a good decision to book Air Serbia I would only wish for an online-check-in-service next time.
3145,We flew JNB to Seychelles on 21 April and back on 1 May 2015. The Cabin was good and the seat comfort very good - not completely lie flat but very close and much more comfortable than Emirates Business Class. Service is what you would expect from Business class. Outward bound trip from Johannesburg was good. Nightmare was on Inbound trip. The flight departure time was 8am but at around 5pm the evening prior to the flight they sent an email out to the travel agents that they have moved the departure time 1 hour earlier. They didn't contact the customers themselves and no one with authority at Air Seychelles was available to talk to. For people on Mahe the 1 hour earlier departure wasn't the end of the world but for people on the outlying islands who relied on a regular ferry service there was no way to make our flight and flights for next 3 days were fully booked. In the end we had to charter a boat to get us to the airport on time we were the lucky ones - others missed their flight completely. It seems that customer service is not something Air Seychelles understands. The flight back was uneventful except that 2 of the seats in business class were out of order and that the cabin staff were extremely noisy talking non stop at high volume throughout the flight. Sleeping wasn't easy but they just didn't care.
3146,I fly to Seychelles frequently and unfortunately as a Silver member of Etihad I fly Air Seychelles from Abu Dhabi to Seychelles. The services are terrible. Firstly they talk way too much all those announcements! From fasten your seatbelts to marketing their duty free it is in 3-4 languages. They start in English them French then Creole. Safety info presented in English and Arabic. Fasten seatbelts warning start with Chinese. The whole flight you listen to this nonsense. Entertainment system is very limited food is not great either. The most annoying thing for me is that as a Silver member I have never been able to upgrade with miles. They will not do it at the airport and even the manager on duty does not know how this is done I find it very annoying what is the point of being the frequent flyer then?
3147,Abu Dhabi to Hong Kong return using Air Seychelles. The journey was made easy by the service provided by the air crew. The food was nice there was a decent selection of drinks and the seats were comfortable. I would travel with this airline again and I would definitely recommend. I am a Gold card holder with Etihad and was initially dubious about flying with a connected airline.
3148,NZ to Osaka via Narita. Multiple delays before take off resulting in missed connection and an overnight stay in Tokyo. Very poor communication from staff and despite promises made about contacting my waiting family - none made! They made no effort to get me on earliest flight possible - just you will take what you are given mentality. Due to late arrival and early departure - no evening meal or breakfast was available (despite vouchers). Then had to bus transfer across to Haneda - then discover I could have caught an earlier flight. Air New Zealand is a very poor airline trading on what used to be a good reputation.
3149,Flew an old ropey 737-300 from AKL-WLG domestic route within New Zealand. Firstly crew are unfriendly and rude. Seats lumpy and very uncomfortable. Plane was dirty - clearly had not been cleaned for weeks with finger marks smeared across the window litter from previous flight - sweet wrappers strewn across the floor fold out tray sticky with dried up coffee spilled. looking down on the floor clearly not vacuumed for weeks with gooey grime around the seat fixings. Seat covers peeling off. Was offered a thimble of water and a stale cookie as food. The overhead screens are so out of focus that you have to strain your eyes to watch it. All of this for premium prices. Basically Air New Zealand operate a low-cost budget operation at sky high prices and compared with the other options I'd say avoid Air New Zealand domestic if you can help it.
3150,Agree with punctuality issues: On August 18th we were flying BEG - BRU - New York. There were 52 passengers who had a flight to New York JFK to catch. The airline should know this. Air Serbia decided to wait for a few transit passengers and their baggage risking the flights to New York for the 52 of us thus causing the 52 passengers not making their flight to New York. Other than that: food is the best: nowhere else will you get a cooked meal for a 2 hours flight and it was delicious!
3151,Flew LHR-BEG-LHR. Significant improvement from JAT in terms of on board experience especially aesthetic. A319 interior appearance in terms of seat colour lighting and cleanliness on par if not better than the likes of Lufthansa BA Air France. Plane took off on-time on both legs crew were very kind and helpful and seat comfort was solid. The fact that a full meal was served on a 2.5 hour flight was certainly a plus tasted better than what was served on my BA transatlantic flight home. My only reproach would be the slightly irritating boarding music a tad bit too traditional for a 21st century airline setting. All in all it's clear that the company is on the right track and I would not be surprised if it soon ranks among Europe's best in terms of service quality. Glad to see the on-time performance improving day by day especially considering the earlier issues with the Beirut flights.
3152,Frequent flyer AMS-BEG: all the compliments for the staff - Air Serbia provides a great service and a really nice selection of complementary food & beverages. A couple of points for improvement: please add an evening flight on Thursday for AMS-BEG line add on-line check-in please return the 30kg baggage limit finally improve the check- in procedure in BEG for early flights.
3153,In October this year I flew AUH-HKG-AUH HM86 and HM87. Although slightly late leaving Abu Dhabi due to a catering issue the entire experience with Air Seychelles was brilliant. Although they were not particularly new A330-200 aircraft's and the entertainment system a bit old and limited I found the cabin crew quite possibly the best in the business. They were an energetic and enthusiastic crew working hard to give excellent customer service to passengers. The flights were not full on either sector so having 2 seats to myself was great and comfortable. After friendly chats about the airline with some of the crew in the galley I was brought champagne and chocolates to my seat a lovely gesture. Air Seychelles was a stark contrast to their partner airline Etihad.
3154,We travelled AUH/SEZ/AUH April 2013. The flights were both excellent. On time comfortable and with enthusiastic cabin crew. Even addressed by name in economy class!
3155,Possibly the worst mid haul airplane I've been on. Was booked through Etihad (superb airline) but got Seychelles instead! Frankly it felt like Ryanair or Easyjet. Give it the widest berth! I'll even avoid Etihad to avoid the chance of this tin pot airline.
3156,Flew from Los Angeles to Auckland on the new 777-300 in the space seats. Great mood lighting in the cabin. We were in row 28JK. The seats are comfortable and stylish and face towards the windows for a great view on take off and landing. The flight crew were smiles all around offered us a drink before take off so had a glass of bubbly. Supper was served on this late flight and we both had creamy crab and smoked salmon salad braised lamb with wholegrain mustard mash and veggies delicious. Settled down to watch a movie good selection. With pillow and blanket made myself comfortable in our seats instructions for the seat are in the seat pocket. Great flight home with great service.
3157,I fly on a fairly regular basis over the last 2 or 3 years I would fly from Auckland to Singapore every couple of months on Jetstar or Qantas and I fly economy. This last 3 months I have flown from Auckland to Los Angeles last month on Virgin this week on Air New Zealand. The problem flying Virgin is that I need a stop in Sydney having said that the fare is a good price the service between Auckland and Sydney and Sydney and Los Angeles was good - very good. On the return I had to fly Virgin to Sydney but an Air New Zealand code share between Sydney and AKL that was the down part of the journey. Narrow seats tatty aircraft pay for a meal pay for everything - the complete opposite of the similar virgin segment on the outward journey. I figured it was because it was a transtasman that Air New Zealand treat passengers like cattle and nickel and dime them but this last trip I decided to go Auckland-LAX direct. Air New Zealand charge $300 more than their rivals you get 1 bag unlike Virgin where you get 2 the plane is dirty the cabin crew are ok a couple were a little off hand to the person in the seat beside me no blanket no eye cover no little pack of toothpaste. I guess for me it was just a disappointment I thought they were better and I remember a few years ago they were now they are just a budget airline that charge a premium price based on a past reputation. I will continue to use them for speed but if I have time I would choose Virgin Australia or Qantas.
3158,AKL to NRT B777-200 economy class. My flight was delayed 30 minutes but still arrived in Tokyo on time. The seat was quite cramped and uncomfortable even though I'm not a tall person. Meals were average and not enough for me. One plus point is that the ice cream was tasty. The entertaining programmes were very limited and picture quality of my TV screen was not good. Flight attendants were friendly enough. Honestly I expected more from a 4-star airline like Air New Zealand.
3159,"My wife and I flew to Tonga from Auckland on 5th July 2014 and returned 12th July 2014 The aircraft used on both sectors was a 19 year old 767-300. The aircraft was in pretty good order considering it's age. Departure pretty well on time. Friendly staff. Idiotic Bear Grylls safety video. Reasonable selection of audio video. Food awful vegetable frittata Air NZ has been serving for some time now. Return food much better - beef salad or butter chicken. One water round on each flight. ""Kia Ora"" Inflight magazine no longer in every seat back. No more than twelve copies available from magazine rack at forward cabin. Toilets clean and tidy. This is the only airline surfacing Tonga from Auckland. Good flights both ways."
3160,I flew with Air Serbia from Podgorica to Belgrade and from Belgrade to Frankfurt and can recommend it! The staff were very helpful and polite and spoke very good English. The food was good and pillows were provided - a very nice add-on to make any trip more enjoyable. The landing in Frankfurt was fantastic. A very pleasant experience indeed!
3161,We recently flew Paris-Belgrade and Belgrade-Paris. It was refreshing to see standards of aircraft interior staff training and general comfort lifted considerably. On both occasions we travelled in business class enjoying perks like comfortable seats delicious meals and excellent service provided by polite flight attendants. I paid for inflight entertainment was provided and together with constant care from flight attendants flight was enjoyable.
3162,Will never fly with Air Serbia again. The service was extremely bad. Airport staff WERE the worst and most apathetic I have seen. Food WAS horrible. Miles (for 2 separate flights) were never registered. No information given about anything during the entire trip. seats changed aircraft changed (again - 2 different flights) staff did not know what was going on. No priority boarding. No entertainment system although they promise an ipad. This was like flying economy on a low cost carrier.
3163,Flew JNB-SEZ and return. On both ways we had the same aircraft an older but very well maintained A330. The seats in economy are very comfortable and the service and catering were outstanding. Even the toilets were cleaned several times during the flight. Only the inflight entertainment could be better but I had my own iPad.
3164,Flights in economy from Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi via Mahe on 27 March. On time excellent service comfortable seating and adequate entertainment. Was a joy to travel with them and transfer at the Seychelles airport easy. Airport is old and small - just a short walk to plane - not much to do there but fine for transfer. Highly recommended. Disgraceful service.
3165,Travelled with them from Dar es Salaam to Mumbai on 23 Dec return 4 Jan 2015. Inflight service from Dar to Seychelles was awful. We had ordered chicken meals instead were given pasta. Because of the time factor and that they had only 2 attendants to serve 120 passengers they didn't respond to our call and when they did it was as if they were doing us a favour. Seychelles to Mumbai and back the service was good.
3166,NZ 2 Auckland to LAX on July 13th 2014. The cabin temperature was so hot! I mentioned about the temperature several times to flight attendants. It seemed as if they agreed. I have never been on a flight where the temperature was so hot. The seats were so close together. The girl next to me was practically on my lap and she was leaning on me the whole time. For whatever reason some of the NZ planes have seats that are too high that my feet don't touch the floor. Yes I'm short! You would think that seat-proximity wouldn't matter but it still does. There's nowhere to put my feet except to have them dangle. On a 12 hour flight with my feet dangling my knees were killing me! There were no footrests or anything. I put my handbag on the floor so I could put my feet up on that but it was still uncomfortable. I didn't quite understand why the Trans-Tasman flight from Melbourne to Auckland had reclining foot rests but a 12 hour flight wouldn't? Furthermore the seats are so close that when the person in front of me is reclined if I'm not reclined I can barely move. Unless something changes drastically by the next time we go back to New Zealand/Australia I will not be taking Air New Zealand. On a side note the staff try to be friendly and helpful but that is their job. I can't really say that they are any more or less friendly/helpful that staff on other airlines. The food was decent. The wine is always nice. Entertainment needs to be updated. On a good note the flight from Melbourne to Auckland on July 11th was fantastic. But the other 3 flights I've had with Air NZ including this one were terrible.
3167,I flew AKL-LAX on 24 June NZ2 returning LAX-AKL on 1 July on NZ5. I was in Business Class both ways. The service and attention to detail is exemplary. Even in the middle of the night pushing the call button got immediate attention. The food both ways was exceptional and it was always nice to be asked if I would like some more or is their anything else I can get you. In these days of cost cutting in service and staff on tight contracts Air NZ staff really do go that extra mile and really do look like they enjoy their jobs. The flights arrived early both ends which is always welcomed the pilots very rarely get the recognition they deserve in these surveys.
3168,"My family and I flew from Los Angeles to Rarotonga and return June 15 June 28 Business class. The plane is an older 767-300. The only two possible things I could mention are (1) the seats are not very wide although adequate. (2) the inflight entertainment is somewhat dated. Thing is entertaining us is not what a good airline is all about; getting from point ""A"" to point ""B"" in a timely safe manner is and ANZ is a good airline."
3169,I flew with Air Serbia in June from Abu Dhabi to Belgrade and from Sarajevo to Belgrade. Nice young friendly cabin crew excellent catering and flying with Serbian people you don't need better entertainment. Both flights were on time with wonderful landing from Sarajevo to Belgrade turning around Avala mountain.
3170,BEG-LHR and LHR-BEG flights. I was very pleased. Flight attendants were very kind food was really good flight departed and landed on time baggage came on time. You can see that they have improved food - a lot of great desserts hot drinks refills and a three-course meal. New Aircraft's (Airbus 319 and 320) have nice exterior they aren't noisy at all and magazines were also provided. Really good experience indeed.
3171,My family and I were supposed to travel Split - Belgrade - Copenhagen. The flight from Split was delayed so we missed our flight in Belgrade to Copenhagen. The trip ended up lasting 23 hours. Staff in Split airport knew nothing whatsoever about why the flight was delayed. Once we arrived in Belgrade overly rude staff booked us for a flight the next day at 5 pm. We had to be at work the following day and wanted an alternative return flight. After discussing the matter with a manager we were booked for an earlier flight. This took us more than 3 hours! Incredibly poor service and rude staff.
3172,I recently travelled from Abu Dhabi to Belgrade. What a fantastic change from JAT to Air Serbia. The staff were very welcoming. There is still a little bit of work to be done with making sure all crew understand that customer requests and their safety is the priority rather than colleague gossip. I was very satisfied with the meal and the variety of drinks provided. The only problem with the trip is the lack of inflight entertainment which is easily fixed with the ipad version like the ones provided by Qantas domestic and Jetstar. I will fly with Air Serbia again in the coming months and look forward to see the airline continue to improve their image and service.
3173,Seats in economy are very comfortable with enough leg room. Unfortunately the staff are not well trained and rude. My airhostess required light was on for the almost entire 5 hour flight from JNB to Seychelles as I was trying to request a glass of water for my son eventually my husband went to the kitchen where they were standing and obtained a glass of water. When they served lunch they would serve 3 rows and then start clearing plates from the first row! That is how slow the service was!
3174,AUH-SEZ round trip on A332 great service very polite staff food was tasty and plentiful. You cannot check- in online but you can request a seat. Even though they received the plane last year it has old IFE has limited movies around 8 and few audio channels. Some screens were not working. They will receive another A332 this year wishing will have better IFE. Good experience I would travel with them anytime.
3175,We were due to fly at 19.30hrs the flight was diverted to Madagascar due to bad weather. We were kept in the terminal until 02.00am. None of the staff knew what was happening. They offered us food vouchers at 00.30hrs the queues for the one food kiosk were so large that it closed before all passengers could get their food. Staff did not give information and were rude. The plane landed from Madagascar about 01.00hrs but they didn't tell us they shipped us off to a hotel at 02.00am. The next day the girl at the desk just put our hand out for my ticket. No apology for the delay no smile. We ended queuing at Mahe for a further 3hours because they were unable to confirm our connections. Once again no-one giving water to passengers we were left like cattle just stood there. I have family in Seychelles but won't be going back until BA return or I'll fly Condor from Frankfurt next time.
3176,I recently took Air New Zealand to Sydney as part of a ticket with connections to a Vietnam Airlines Flight. Arrived early at Auckland Airport checked in with a customer service staff as their cost cutting exercise with no check in counters means that the check in kiosk does not work for when taking connecting flights and having to check your bags through. Arrived early at the gate ready to board at 6.15 am only to board 10 minutes prior to departure meaning we departed late as they have just one staff in charge of the boarding process. When on board felt like a sardine especially with the larger man in front of me with the seat bending back badly. Aircraft certainly ageing and seat very hard and uncomfortable. Food and drink okay but very basic. Entertainment outdated as well was watching something had already seen before. The Air New Zealand staff very casual and not really smiling at all and don't really care about the passengers as long as they are being paid. Can not recommend taking Air New Zealand again.
3177,"Horrible to say the least! My first experience was not one to remember. San Francisco to Auckland on an old plane with ripped seats flight 7 seat A40. The entertainment system was broken in my seat nice job for 12 hours watching nothing with no seats to move to. Once I arrived to Auckland found out not only was my first trip cancelled to Palmerston North but they cancelled it again for the second time each time having to retrieve my luggage and go through the process all over. Then to add insult to the situation they put me on my third flight now 6 hours after when I was supposed to fly and there was a flight which left in between this time frame and I wasn't put on that because it was ""oversold"". My advice don't fly them."
3178,"First experience on Air NZ. Was on the 'works"" fare and it does work. Great wine and food selection. Staff were pleasant and seemed to be interact with most customers. The only disappointing part was the entertainment choice. The plane was old and had to use the remote to change channels. Overall a good flight from SYD-AKL and back."
3179,LHR to LAX and back a week later in Premium Economy. It was really excellent on all fronts: friendly and efficient service from check-in to arrival. The food was plentiful and very nice quality: a salad starter with fresh bread and NZ olive oil a warm meal; dessert cheese and biscuits and good NZ wines. Breakfast and afternoon tea were also excellent with e.g. warm scones clotted cream and jam. The food was better than BA's Club World. The seat provides lots of space and the entertainment system is stocked with films I missed at the cinema so enjoyed catching up with on the plane. The seat doesn't recline that much but there's a bean bag a big pillow and a nice thoughtful amenity kit. There were other fun touches too like a photo of shelves of books with jokey titles on the walls in the toilet. On the way out the luggage belts at Heathrow were broken so most bags did not make it to the plane. Air NZ handled this efficiently on the plane and with minimal fuss in LA we were handed US$100 in cash. This is my first time with Air NZ it's such a shame they don't fly to more places from Britain!
3180,WAW-BEG-SKG-BEG-WAW the flights departed on time polite and smiling staff speaking good English relatively new planes baggage arrived without delays. Food was very bland though a sandwich and a tiny bottle of water which is okay for short haul flights. Good price/quality ratio so I can call my experience with Air Serbia positive and I would recommend it.
3181,BEI-BEL-CPH and CPH-BEL-BEI: Took a return flight from Beirut to Copenhagen via Belgrade. On both legs the flights were delayed (from BEI-BEl and BEL-BEI). The luggage was delayed for the majority of the flight on both legs in Copenhagen and Beirut. Absolutely dreadful. In Copenhagen the flight was on time but decided to shut the bag drop off an hour early to the amazement of airport staff. The food is inedible and there's no in-flight entertainment. I fly regularly this is the worst experience I've had with an airline.
3182,AUH-BEG-LHR. AUH-BEG portion: relatively new plane A319 great food with a local flare (I asked for a lactose-free meal and it was better than expected) comfortable seats FAs super pleasant; great service. BEG-LHR portion: older 737 but totally ok. Great service courteous staff nice meal. Very pleasantly surprised by both flights. Thumbs up!
3183,Service was excellent staff friendly meals were good. Boeing 767-200 was very very old. My son went to put his seatbelt on and it came off in his hand. The seat adjacent to that one had a table that wouldn't stay up. They do need new equipment but flight was otherwise uneventful.
3184,LHR-SEZ outbound in Pearl via Milan return in Economy via Rome. Very unique feel to this airline it's a small airline serving a small population plus tourists. Impressed by food service in both classes one of the best breakfasts I have had in Business Class and on the return offering 2 hot meals on a day flight was impressive. Staff were very friendly the whole thing did seem a little dated but in a good way. The IFE is still overhead TV screens with very lame films. The stops in Italy make the flights long but not too bad.
3185,We had to travel to France from Gatwick to catch our flight. Staff are warm friendly and helpful. I have never come away from a flight thinking how awful it was.
3186,I flew Air Seychelles (code share with Air France) Business class from Paris to Mahe. I regularly fly Business and I have to say on this particular flight the service was as good if not better than many of them. The crew were very good the service was excellent and the food great. Beds were 95% flat (not enough incline to notice). Even the comfort pack had organic creams and oils flower essences etc. I cant comment on the entertainment as I worked and slept most of the flight but I remember being impressed with the overall service from beginning to end. I flew again a week later again in Economy which seemed about average in comparison to other airlines.
3187,Paris to the Seychelles. The cabin itself is in good condition. the staff seemed a bit awkward and on the return flight was the entire crew were rude and arrogant. Food was as expected in the Economy. Despite seat reservation I had a different seat in the middle of three. I got no answer as to why my seat was changed.
3188,We flew Air New Zealand on our way to New York via Los Angeles return. We were impressed with the service friendliness and professionalism of the crew on all flights. They were immaculately presented and extremely helpful. This airline is in a league of its own.
3189,"Flying today with Air NZ MEL-AKL and I cant even buy food on the plane! Been told I need a credit card to buy anything and since I don't have one I guess I've got to sort my own food. Ill also add the rude manner I was told this by staff at the gate just a very unapologetic ""that's the way it is"" tone."
3190,BNE-CHC-BNE. What a difference a crew makes. BNE-CHC (NZ805) flight on 16 June was very empty but crew not very interested in working. As a VA Platinum member not offered the usual services (headphones express immigration etc) that normally would be offered. Seemed a challenge to even get a glass of wine (I was on a 'works' fare). While the in-flight manager was busy spending all of his time with 2 passengers not much care shown to the rest of us on the airplane. Return CHC-BNE (NZ804) on 20 June was a different story. Fantastic crew (2 in-flight managers so perhaps a check or training flight). Service was great attentive and friendly. Food good and drinks offered plentiful. This crew made all the difference in turning a bad experience outbound into a great experience inbound.
3191,Belgrade - Beirut. Great staff and good food. But and it is a big but these frequent delays on Air Serbia is not acceptable. Punctuality is a must. The nights flight 3 hours late and arrived only after 6 in the morning. Not good at all when planning meetings etc. If punctuality does not get better soon I have to opt for another airline despite the good service onboard.
3192,I had a flight from Sarajevo to Paris via Belgrade. The quality of service is considerably improved after rebranding JAT into Air Serbia by Etihad. The food was served for both flights was a small sandwich from Sarajevo and cold meal from Belgrade. The staff were very efficient pleasant and communicative. However I have one general observation -?“both flights were delayed about 1 hour. I observed that a number of flights operating by Air Serbia were delayed. This was a bit stressful taking into account one hour stopover. The air company should pay more attention on punctuality and ground staff who suppose to provide assistance to passengers. Otherwise the trip was good and I think the company is on right track.
3193,In 40 years of travelling this was the first time that an airline could not offer hot drinks due to lack of hot water. On a different matter how is it possible to assess an airline without addressing their Baggage and Compensation issues which are such an integral part of the total experience?
3194,Tivat to Moscow via Belgrade was late 3 hours and 32 passengers missed connect flight! We were put in filthy Slavia hotel in Belgrade. I reached Moscow only in the evening on the second day. My claim report wasn't answered!
3195,LAX-PPT-LAX. Having read some of the reviews on here I was a bit worried about what we'd encounter on these flights. Both were overnight so we tried to sleep and made no use of the entertainment system. The aircraft interior was clean and well maintained and the crew were very good. Breakfast was decent. The seat is angled lie flat but reasonably comfortable. Both flights were on time and bags were off quickly. The only downside I could see was the high fares due to I assume lack of competition.
3196,I flew to Mahe from London Heathrow via Milan. Everything was done on time and service was excellent. Crew were friendly and took great care of my sick mother thought the flight. I really enjoyed the flight and will recommend the airline to anyone who wants to travel to the beautiful Seychelles.
3197,Originally booked our flight from Chennai (India) to Seychelles but were sent an email 4 weeks before departure saying this route had been cancelled and we were now flying out from Singapore. Air Seychelles paid the difference but we then had to fly into Singapore from Australia and lost the cost of our original flight to Chennai. We feel we should have been informed about this when we first booked and this would have saved us a lot of money. Apart from that we were pleased with the service of Air Seychelles. The service on board was excellent the food was pleasant and the comfort was of a superior class to many other airlines we have flown. Plenty of leg room and as the plane was only half full we were able to have two seats each. Personally we would recommend Air Seychelles to anyone but the flight to Singapore is only 6-7 hrs long so we have not experienced a really long flight. An enjoyable experience and we will definitely go the Seychelles again on Air Seychelles.
3198,NZ80 HKG to AKL. 22nd June 2014. Business Class. B777-200ER. The aircraft was old and shabby. The herringbone seat configuration facing away from the window is like a coffin. The seat is narrow and has limited recline when seated normally as the lay flat bed requires the seat back to be folded fully forward. The bed is reasonably comfortable with the mattress pad. The welcome aboard drink was Sparking Wine not Champagne and served by one of the 3 Grumpy Old Men who were attending the forward cabin. Food was just edible and the choices very poor. No wines listed and when asked was told Pinot Noir or Cab Sav. No hangars suitable to hang trousers for those who change into travelling clothes. The AV is something out of the ark. A screen that has a resolution such that everything looks as if the lens is smeared with Vaseline. A controller whereby when pressed takes a few seconds to respond and sound and screen hesitation on both movie and audio channels (seat 3A if anyone from AirNZ read these posts). Breakfast coffee was vile but the hot bacon roll was a pleasant change. I hope the B777-300 is a step up as I have a west coast return trip soon. If not I shall stick to SQ and EK for all my long haul trips. There are better alternatives and the penny pinching shows maybe this route doesn't justify anything better but even CX with the dated A340 aircraft on this route is a much better experience.
3199,My husband and I recently few from Sydney to Apia via Auckland. We checked in online and printed our own boarding passes to save time and lock our seats in. When we arrived at the airport we had to go through the whole process again making our online check in pointless. The first leg of the journey was on a reasonably comfortable Boeing 777-200 but the second leg was on an Airbus A320 which was one of the most cramped airline seats I've ever sat on. Both planes felt old and tired. The meal we had was adequate but nothing more. I was quite disappointed overall but one thing I'll say is the stay were very friendly and helpful.
3200,"Flew BUD-BEG-LCA-BEG-VIE as it was far cheaper than any other airline low-costs including. BUD-BEG was on an older ATR72 there was exactly 12 passengers in the plane. Small snack (a sandwich and a cookie in a doggie bag) and one round of drinks on a one hour long flight! Had to ask specifically for the vegetarian meal we ordered (it was on the plane was labelled with my gf's name was not given out automatically). The ride was a little noisy as in the old ATR but can not complain. Problem-free transfer in BEG security at the gate and BEG-LCA on an ancient Boeing 737-300. It had the old JAT livery stripped down but one could still see the outline of the letters and three dots on the tail - from outside the plane looked just sad. Inside however the seats looked refurbished and to my surprise there was quite a lot of legroom. On this 2 hour flight hot meal was served (menu was handed out). I skipped mine my gf had her vegetarian meal and it looked and tasted fantastic. And a bonus - proper metal cutlery! Round of drinks as well. Return LCA-BEG departing at unholy time (4am in the morning) was delayed about half an hour making us worried about short connection in BEG. This time their ""new"" A319 which is not new at all. The legroom was much worse than on the old 737 and to be honest one of the worst I have ever experienced (I'm 185cm tall). Slept all time so can not comment on the food (but there was some). Bit unorganized transfer in BEG (we were checked all the way to VIE but some other passengers were missing their boarding passes) but I must appreciate that upon leaving the aircraft there was someone for each connecting flight helping the passengers. Last leg BEG-VIE on a sad ATR72 for me a cookie and a yoghurt in a doggie bag the vegetarian meal was an orange (that's it - just orange). Our luggage did not make the short connection in BEG. Air Serbia probably won't be my airline of choice but if they again offer such deal as they did now no problem flying them again."
3201,"Used Air Serbia twice once from Stuttgart to Belgrade in February 2014 and once Belgrade to Copenhagen March 2014. Excellent experience. Stuttgart - Belgrade was done by old Bulgarian Boeing but you could still ""feel"" the difference by newspapers meals and drinks and much younger crew. BEG-Copenhagen was great new Airbus excellent meal and coffee plus great desserts. I will use them again."
3202,We flew on April 7 and 14 back and forth to Papeete. While the airline staff were friendly and helpful sadly we had an older plane that was not clean and the seats were extremely uncomfortable for our overnight flights. A standard roller bag carry on will not fit in the overhead compartment wheels first and had to be placed sideways. They don't really weigh your carry on at check in but the weight amount of 22 lbs is generous. They didn't weigh or even notice our backpacks. The tray tables were dirty the bathrooms were not kept up during flight and the seats/floor were stained throughout the cabin. I brought Clorox wipes after reading prior reviews to clean off our seating area and felt better after doing so. The amenities were nice such as the overnight flight kit pillows and blankets which were a pleasant feature. The food was not very good at all cold and soggy. The best bet is to bring something such as a Powerbar if you are a picky eater. The movies on the plane were of a good selection but when flying overnight you don't have much time to watch a movie if you are trying to rest. The flight was bumpy both ways but the pilot was considerate in not keeping the seat belt light on for an over-extended period of time. My suggestion is to ask at check in if there are two seats together to transfer to if you are stuck in the row of four you will be much more comfortable. Row 43 (a row of 4) in the back has in seat tray tables so you can't lift the armrest if traveling with a companion and this is not noted anywhere even on Seat Guru. The airport in Papeete is under construction and it took over 2.5 hours for the two planes that arrived at the same time to clear passport control which made us miss the ferry to Moorea. In conclusion if flying to Tahiti again I would try to find a different airline when booking but would likely fly this one again if I had too as the destination is paradise.
3203,LHR-SEZ-LHR. It's true that there aren't personal TVs like on Virgin or BA but this wasn't particularly important to me - I'd rather read a book. The food was tasty and drinks are free. My only niggle is that it wasn't that clear that we would be stopping.
3204,Seychelles to Paris. A middle age Boeing 767 clean and seems to be well maintained. No PTV's which is now a must have. Seat pitch okay crew was nice and professional. The food was excellent aperitif was served with Champagne and all beverages free of charge.
3205,Flew Auckland to Narita in premium economy in a 777-200. Seat was fine helped by the fact that seat next to me was unoccupied. Service from staff was very good friendly and efficient. You don't appear to get bubbly/juice before departure anymore and the choice of wines was same as in economy. Meals were good and tasty. Massive choice of movies.
3206,There is not often that you are sorry to get of the plane but I was after my trip with Air New Zealand. My husband and I flew Air New Zealand to the United States in May. Having flown various airlines before Air New Zealand is right up there with the best. The service given by their more mature staff was exceptional compared with other airlines who use a younger cabin crew. The only reason I rate the satisfaction of my trip 9/10 is that they code share with United who must come bottom of my list (the trip with United between New York and Los Angeles the worst I have ever had). If you fly Air New Zealand to the United States organize your onward trip yourself so that you can avoid flying United.
3207,I flew London to Belgrade return on a newly fitted Airbus A320 outwards and A319 return. The new Aircraft's have a bright and welcoming interior which sets the scene for their product offering. The crew were polite and attentive throughout the flight although perhaps a little cool in their interactions with passengers. On the outward flight newspapers were offered. A menu on both flights was presented which was a nice touch. The food itself was excellent for a short-haul flight - hot plentiful and served with metal cutlery. Certainly the best on board food in Europe. Boarding at Belgrade however is still not well organised should be improved. Overall though a great experience and fantastic to see a new full service Airline come from the ashes of JAT.
3208,A few days ago I returned from Banja Luka. Although the ATR72 was quite noisy the service was excellent especially for the 45 minute flight. Change in quality in comparison with old JAT is highly visible.
3209,Flew Business Class from PPT to LAX only 1 out of 5 planes is older and we had a new cabin. Seats comfortable food excellent service very good. Before Takeoff Captain came through the business class to great every guest personally. If I get the same service every time I would most definitely fly with them again. They are as good as some major Asian Airlines and Miles better than any US Airline I flew recently.
3210,Terrible service. Food was better in economy. Seats were awful - unable to adjust it so you could get comfortable and we are 5ft and 6ft so it should have worked for one of us. Headphone socket broken so unable to watch movies or listen to music. Staff just said 'we can't fix it in flight'. Movies NOT on-demand and you are not informed when they start. Definitely not worth the extra. This was AKL-PPT. Go with Air NZ instead.
3211,Round trip LAX-PPT last 2 weeks of 10/14. Flight out was an old aircraft inflight entertainment was awful. Video worse than your 1957 TV. Service and food ok+. Flight back was newer aircraft and entertainment display was good but content severely limited. Gate agent in PPT refused the check through in domestic USA via the post customs LAX baggage transfer service. She was inflexible and rude about it. They advertise in their magazine they have a deal with Alaska Air my domestic carrier. Alaska in LAX confirmed the deal and that AT was erratic in conforming to the agreement. Moving baggage around LAX isn't fun. Very poor treatment of a business class customer.
3212,SIN-SEZ B767-200.Meal served very tasty. Aircraft clean and seats weren't too bad in terms of comfort. Flight only half full. No seatback AVOD but main screen showing movies on old VHS reel. Impressed with service and professionalism of crew. Water runs by crew through flight. Whilst not near the standards of larger airlines I was impressed with flight and Air Seychelles overall.
3213,SYD to AKL in Business. The check in is like buying a Hamburger just unfriendly. You can see cost cutting here. The lounge in Sydney is out dated and is in need of urgent renovation. The food service is very basic. Onboard extreme cost cutting has taken effect. Considering the amount paid and the service received I would say that there a very little features and benefits. Would not travel NZ again than for the same price I will get much superior service by the opposition.
3214,I flew from Auckland to LAX recently in business class. From the time I sat down it took 55 minutes to be served a drink while it took my wife an hour and ten minutes to receive her first beverage. The service during the flight was adequate but possible I expected more considering the price of the ticket. I would not recommend Air New Zealand but I would also not discourage one from flying this airline.
3215,Just returned Auckland to Adelaide on 9/6/14. The flight departed almost on time the cabin crew were all friendly and happy. Seat quality was good we had exit row seats. Couldn't complain about the food or service. Inflight entertainment was better than expected. We were happy with all aspects of the flight we will definitely fly with this airline again Well done.
3216,I travelled from DUS-BEG and it was an excellent experience totally refurbished airlplane and had the brand new (A319). Hot meal friendly staff still some bugs to iron out.
3217,I have flown with former JAT on a couple of occasions and my impressions were not that great (old planes minimal service and complete disregard for the comfort of passengers). I flew today from Belgrade to Malpensa (flight from Milan to Belgrade I did with Alitalia with a stopover in Rome) although given my previous experience with JAT I wanted to avoid it at all costs. The plane I got onto was neatly furbished quite comfortable economy class seats great catering for a short-haul flight very warm attitude from the crew. The only minus (and it is a big one) currently online check in is not available. Apparently they are working on it and it should be available soon.
3218,Booked C class round trip LAX-PPT. Did not like the previous reviews so I was a little apprehensive. Also as I understand it only 3 of their 5 aircraft have the new C class. As is turned out the new seats were very adequate. At 20.5 they are a tad tight and they do not fully recline. Nonetheless my wife and I were able to sleep most of the way on a long late night flight. Staff were gracious and professional. Food and drink were very adequate but nothing special. All in all a good experience. Tahiti is a very special place and this is as good as it gets.
3219,Flew from CDG to LAX (return) in late August 2014 / early Sept 2014. Awful customer service. The check-in-staff have absolutely no warmth or charm and made no attempt to fulfil my seat request; they were quite abrupt in refusing it moreover. In-air-staff are likewise very poor. Aircraft was old and seats are inadequate. I will never use this airline again. I often travel on Asian airlines and Air Tahiti Nui is way way below par.
3220,CDG-SEZ-CDG Business Class. We traveled on the (only) B767 with the new business class seats (angled lie flat). These seats are a great improvement compared to previous Pearl Class seats. Outward flight on time inward flight with 1h delay due to late arrival of plane (from CDG) and slow boarding at SEZ (due to passengers having to walk in heavy rains on the tarmac to reach jet). Food and wine so-so. Nothing terrific but strangely enough on CDG-SEZ meals were not at all what was shown on the menu (staff apologized). Personal DVD players given for entertainment - provided adequate offering of movies. Overall a decent experience in Business Class.
3221,LHR-SEZ-LHR for our honeymoon. Flight out was okay - 767-200 aircraft was ancient there were a scattering of CRT monitors showing three films which were difficult to watch without a revolvable head crew inattentive and bored looking. Returning on a 767-300 we were first in the queue for check-in because we we wanted to try to get exit aisle seats which we were told we had been given but when we boarded we found ourselves right in the middle of a section in the middle row. If we'd been told this when we checked in this I'd have understood but we were obviously disappointed to have been lied to. I mentioned our dismay to a crew member who said she would speak to the ground staff and get back to me but she didn't bother. Apparently seats are pre-allocated on the return leg so make sure you try to organise this on the way out. My seat was broken so wouldn't stay in the upright position much to the dismay of the person sitting behind me. There was a projector showing the film which would have been an improvement on the tiny CRTs on the way out but wasn't because the image had massive horizontal stripes running through it and the colours were completely out. The staff were surly and rude and mostly ignored you. I called for service and was responded to two hours later. They stood at the back chatting and you pretty much had to physically grab them in order to get their attention. The plane was knackered one of the films broke and had to be restarted and when the announcements were made the film kept playing so you'd miss chunks of it. The food was awful; the dinner like school leftovers breakfast consisting of grey-egged tortilla and chicken that looked like it had been condemned. The only benefit of Air Seychelles is that the fleet is currently so ancient the seat pitch is fair which I'm sure they'll change because according to the inflight magazine the fleet will be upgraded.. Their staff need some proper training and to learn the importance of customer service. Any decent airline would have sacked most of them by now. Very disappointed.
3222,Christchurch to Melbourne on another A320. No priority boarding out of Christchurch. Again no leg room hard bum numbing seat on a full flight. Landed early in Melbourne but had to wait for a gate but not a pesky A380 to vacate our allotted gate.
3223,Melbourne to Christchurch on an A320. Smiles all round on boarding. Seats were hard with little leg room. Just ok for the length of our flight but my bum was getting numb. Sale fare for seat only so was fine for our long weekend in the land of the long white cloud.
3224,My business partner and I flew Auckland/Queenstown on 20 May returning the next day. I don't normally comment on domestic flights but these two flights need recognition for the stellar service provided by Air New Zealand. It was two newish A320's either way and manned by some of the best staff I have encountered. We were Star Alliance Gold so had the options of seats in Row 1. Water tea/coffee and snacks were provided and a second cup was available for anyone that wanted. Well done Air New Zealand!
3225,I've flown with JAT (what Air Serbia used to be called). It was a very basic experience to put it mildly. I was flying from London Heathrow to Belgrade yesterday. A great experience there are some bugs to iron out but this isn't first class it's biz class. Firstly the seats were new - they reclined back and the foot part lifted up. You got a big pillow for your back or head and a blanket. We had two stewardesses between 6 of us but I think that is because one of them was training the other. Both women were very friendly and attentive and offered refills throughout the 2hrs 45min flight. The food. Well anyone who has flown with JAT will know the food was something you literally did not bother with. It was sub par. Now I had a 3 course meal with a choice of wines and champagne (or local Serbian brandy if I wanted). The meal was delicious - it was well presented and hot and not overcooked. It was served with fresh bread rolls. I am fussy with things and I couldn't fault it. The cabin was clean. The cutlery was metal. I was offered an iPad but I had my own tablet to watch a film on. A very positive experience indeed.
3226,Travelled BEG to AMS and return in January/February 2014. Professional crew comfortable seats with nice pillows on every seat. The food was delicious. Excellent experience.
3227,Travelled CDG to BEG and return in late December and early January 2014. The plane was clean (A319) and very well presented with nice pillows on every seat. The crew were very happy to help and were smiling the whole time. You can see that they are new because at times they seemed a bit disorganized but overall they were excellent. The food brings this trip to a whole new level. While in other airlines you are lucky to get a pack of crackers here I got a hot meal. What a transformation from the old airline (JAT).
3228,LAX to Papeete business class: terrible. Where to start: Old seats straight from the 90's bad shape seats an entertainment system with 4 movies and bad screen quality. Bland food and to top it all magazines which were 3 weeks old. Flight attendants are nonchalant to say the least and you don't see them unless you hunt them down. Forget snacks. Just awful and way below par any other airlines.
3229,"AKL-PPT-LAX-PPT in economy May 2014. Air Tahiti Nui only have five A340 aircraft. We flew on three of these - all were different experiences. The first leg AKL-PPT was on ""Moorea"" which had an upgraded interior and felt very new and fresh. Leg room seemed adequate for economy however as others have said previously the seat designer should be sacked! The head rest is not ergonomic at all and causes discomfort. The is also no lumbar support. I packed the seat back out with pillows to help. The crew were young friendly and worked the cabin non stop. Food on all flights was edible if not slightly odd - the seat designer must have had input in the menu as well. Entertainment on demand comprised of about 10 of movies (some recent releases) and TV shows. The second flight an 8.5 hr overnight flight from PPT-LAX was on ""Nuku Hiva"". This aircraft was also retrofitted with the new interior however it felt older. tired and there was a noticeable decrease in leg room despite us being in the same seat number on both flights. The crew were a bit surly and disappeared after trolley service. Again the seats weren't that comfortable due to the awful head rest and lack of leg room. Our third flight overnight from LAX to PPT was on ""Bora Bora"" which has yet to have it's interior retrofitted. The seats were much more comfortable than the newer version in economy as they lacked the offending head rest but the entertainment is on the old loop system rather than 'on demand'. Would I fly them again? Only if the price was right (we scored half price tickets) - you only get what you pay for!"
3230,The seats were so uncomfortable I was dreading the flight home. There was no lumbar support and the add on headrest pushed my head forward putting my neck at a very unnatural position. I could not get comfortable using pillows and blankets or in any position. It made for a very long flight home.
3231,CDG-SEZ-CDG. Good flight with B767-300ER. The aircraft has a nice blue relaxing interior in Pearl class and service was okay. Inflight entertainment system very simple and not very good. Cabin crew good and replying on anyone's request. Food was better than expected. Seat was comfortable but not electronic powered. I heard Air Seychelles is going to have a new IFE and lie flat beds later in June.
3232,MRU-SEZ-MRU. The 767-200ER on this route is showing its age; I hadn't realised that cabins with a single video display still exist (making it difficult to see the safety video from the rear of the cabin). Visiting the toilet after the outward take off all the cupboard doors were open and the hand wash bottles were rolling around in the sink. The recline mechanism in my last row window seat was broken. On both legs cabin service was unenthusiastic. Seat pitch though is reasonable.
3233,San Francisco to Melbourne and may I say never again. I checked in at Seattle (flew with United from SEA-SFO) so my baggage was fine. Arrived at SFO to find out that my aircraft was delayed 6 hours and were never told why. Got on board to have the crew be rude. I had a small child sitting next to me constantly reaching over my tray table and stealing my food from me neither the father or cabin crew did something even when asked. Once arriving in Auckland I had a transit time of what was now reduced to 5 hours originally being 12. When returning to the airport there was a mistake in short-checking my bag as the system still showed my bag checked through to Melbourne. After having this all happen I then had my carry-on luggage weighed. I had taken items out in AKL. I was then found that my bag was 0.5kg over and that it couldn't travel with me even if it was checked. After a lot of negotiation I was finally allowed to take my bag as carry on. Onboard my trans-tasman flight it was quite pleasant however not as great as other airlines I have experienced. I don't recommend Air NZ to anybody.
3234,Flew to LAX from Auckland on May 13 2014 and from San Francisco to Auckland on May 27. The return flight had a horrible selection of movies and TV. The food on both flights was abysmal. There is nothing I can really order to eat that suits my dietary requirements so I chose vegetarian as a last resort. Horrible choice. Will have to bring my own food in future but shouldn't I get a discount for not being provided with a meal?
3235,My first two flights on NZ Air within the last two years were lovely. The food was good the seats decent. I was surprised and impressed that we were given little packs with toothpicks toothpaste etc and there were numerous new movies to watch. This trip from New Zealand to LA was quite different. The chicken was grisly and tough actually inedible there was no little pack to charm us and the seats were tighter. I'm a slim person and felt claustrophobic. I'm looking for a different airline for my next flights from New Zealand. I'd rather pay a little more and enjoy the long flight.
3236,Sydney to YVR via Auckland on 11th May. Airbus A320 SYD - Auckland a joke cramped and ridiculous should not be used for a 3.5 hour journey Auckland to YVR on 777-200ER different story plane showing age however was quite comfortable selected vegetarian option surprisingly good did the reverse journey leaving YVR 28th May again 777-200 ER YVR to Auckland and a much better option 767-300 Auckland to Sydney service efficient. If 777-200ER seating configuration changes to a 3-4-3 as envisaged I definitely would not travel on Air New Zealand management should be forced to endure these cramped seats for 12-14 hours and see way at it feels like.
3237,"My polite complaint received an automated ""Rest assured we will respond in no more than 30 days"", which never happened. And my follow up after 60 days, was ignored. My seat was assigned to another passenger, even though I was holding a boarding card with the same seat number. Wheelchair assistance for my mother was not arranged in Amsterdam.  Airport crew tried but could not come up with a solution as the airport was busy. And after this being told that they had left our luggage back in Vancouver. A simple sorry goes a long way."
3238,JU 311 12 Dec and JU 314 to Paris on 15 Dec. Friendly and professional crew very comfortable seats plenty of leg room stylish pillows and blankets excellent selection of wine and drinks and delicious meal. When the flight attendant handed me the menu I thought there must be a fee attached. I got a hot meal free. Excellent experience. On a way back was the same. I came to Belgrade airport ground support staff were smiling professional and accommodating. On the flight back the same good service and experience. Have just bought another ticket with Air Serbia to Thessaloniki!
3239,ARN-BEG 27 January 2014. Old plane still but fantastic service and great food. Staff did their uttermost to serve the passengers. Good wines with plenty of refills. Strange though that there was nothing sweet to drink with the coffee like for example Baileys. When the new Airbus will enter service they might be one of the best airlines in Europe.
3240,BEG-AUH-BNE - 21 Dec 2013. Flight 50% full check-in ok but could not issue ticket or select seat on AUH-BNE component of same ticket which was disappointing. Meal reasonable goulash with gnocchi fine lights on for too long would have preferred brightness lowered soon after take-off for night flight. On arrival to AUH had be bussed to terminal crew decent slight attitude - seemed a bit annoyed that I accidentally called. Otherwise friendly during other times meal service and welcome. Plane looked good and I had whole row to myself so that was great. 7.5 out of 10. Also a bit annoyed to find out unable to earn velocity points even on EY's BNE to AUH since ticket issued by Air Serbia. I'm velocity platinum and AUH-BNE also has VA flight code. Going back in a month and checkmytrip was showing both Etihad and Air Serbia flights AUH to BEG until I advised of this hope it was not blocking others from booking.
3241,Loved this airline except for one problem. They changed our return flight from Auckland so we had to layover for the night. We did not appreciate this change. It cost us a lot more money to stay in a hotel for one night in Tahiti. It made the trip much longer. The flight to Tahiti didn't get in until 9.45 pm and customs took forever. Then we had to be back to the airport by 6 am. If they had to make this change they could have at least left earlier so we wouldn't have had such a long night.
3242,March 29 PPT TAHITI FRENCH POLYNESIA - LAX LOS ANGLES CA. The flight was horrible. After spending a great deal of money for a business class seat I literally had to get up and go and find flight attendants to get a drink of water after not seeing them for a 3 hour stretch. The food was terrible as well. Not worth the money! Horrible service.
3243,"Seats are incredibly uncomfortable and service was ok but nothing spectacular. I reacted to something in the air and my eyes started watering and I couldn't stop coughing. I pushed the service button waited 20 minutes and the attendant finally came turned it off and walked away! I cannot stress enough how uncomfortable the seats are especially for tall people. My husband is 6'1"" and I'm 5'9"". We couldn't move and didn't sleep the entire flight down or back. If there was another way to get to Paradise we would definitely take it!"
3244,Flew LAX to PPT and back for an Oceania Cruise. Going to PPT things were just OK. After all you are heading to paradise so it's easier to overlook less than friendly service uncomfortable seats and marginal food. Our return flight was a charter arranged by the cruise line and things were much worse. They had little or no ice limited beverage options and the food was awful. The flight attendants just don't have any spark to them. Some of that may be a cultural thing because I find customer service in FP to be less warm and inviting than in Europe or the US. This airline needs to really punch up their customer service.
3245,SIN-SEZ-SIN. Used Air Seychelles as it was the most direct flight since travelling with 2 young children but now I wished I had travelled via the middle east. Air Seychelles staff arrogant and unfriendly. Asked for food for kids to no avail. Had to get up and fetch it myself. They had loud conversations with their co-workers across the aisle while serving food. Upon arrival to SEZ airport my youngest was sleeping on my shoulder and needed help with hand luggage while going down the stairs to the tarmac. Instead of helping they stood there and watch me like I was their circus act for the night. Thanks to a fellow passenger who came to my rescue! The Air Seychelles cabin crew really has a chip on their shoulder. Didn't look like they were very happy to be doing what they were doing.
3246,LHR-SEZ-SEZ. Our family trip was without incident. Plane was pretty empty on the way out so plenty of space to move around. Fortunately our flight was the first schedule for the re- opening of air space due to the volcanic ash. Plane full to capacity as expected. Cabin crew very accommodating able to obtain refreshments at any time.
3247,Heathrow from Mahe - 12.5 hours of hell. We had a seat that you could not tilt and I had a very sharp part of the planes interior sticking in my leg. I asked the stewardess if she could do something - she looked at me as if I had asked her to jump out of the plane and then gave me a cushion to put between me and the broken plug cover. So we had to sit bolt upright in these terrible seats with me having to try not to move or the cushion would fall down.. I have to say I was in tears in the end. I did notice there was another lady in the opposite seats to us and she was in a very distressed was too. Wrote to Air Seychelles hoping for an apology and an explanation as to why they let anyone travel in these most terrible seats. I have not heard a word. Very upset. Next time we will go with another airline and I will have no second thoughts about telling any of my friends to do the same.
3248,CDG-SEZ-CDG. Overall average airline that left me with mixed feelings. Outward flight delayed by 2 hours due to technical failure with chaotic (or no) information given (AF staff and Aeroport de Paris are responsible). Inward flight was on time. Smily and efficient crew on outward flight versus grumpy and unfriendly crew on inward flight. On both flights business class seats show their age and very old concept (no lie flat no electrical control). IFE is a joke (not on demand personal screens show only two channels) but crew can provide on request some DVD like personal readers with a (limited) choice. 5 movies that are on demand. Aircraft are old but food (choice of international and creole) and wines (1 champagne 2 red and 2 white wines) were good with a nice service of cheese and desserts. Unfortunately absolutely no service between meals on inward day flight. Beverages had to be negotiated with crew in the galley. Lounges good (but AF at CDG). To sum up decent aircraft with modern cabins are needed and some cabin crew need to improve their attitude.
3249,CDG-SEZ-CDG. Aircraft pretty clean and comfortable. IFE is very limited - 3 movies were screened all of them with a French soundtrack. Meals excellent and we were served champagne for the aperitif. Crews nice and helpful.
3250,AKL-YVR B777-200ER. Flight on time. Crew professional and friendly. Regular water runs for overnight flight. Meals were good. IFE provides a good selection but would have benefited from more new releases. Seats were comfortable and I managed to get some sleep. Aisles were somewhat narrow and I understand that the seat configuration is being changed to 3-4-3. I do wonder how uncomfortable this would make this 12 hour flight.
3251,Napier-Auckland-Napier . Two smooth on time flights with the ATR 72 offering more comfort than many short haul jets. Service friendly and professional. Water/coffee/tea and biscuit offered as is the norm for short haul flights within NZ. Some readers bemoan this but would you get similar on a bus or train trip of one hour? Air NZ still offers boiled sweets prior to landing which is a simple but nice touch. Luggage delivered promptly at both ends and check-in efficient too whether assisted (Napier) or through automated machine (Auckland). Auckland Airport domestic terminal is a little tired and dull but it still works.
3252,Flew from BNE-AKL-LAX on the 777-300 for both legs. Paid extra for the paired seats which Air New Zealand sells as 'Preferred' seats. Sat in 35a through to Auckland which was alright. Good to be towards the front of the plane for disembarking but the seats are quite narrow and cramped. Sat in 57k onto LA which was slightly better. Missed out on preferred meal but only because I was right down the end. Food was the best I've had in a long time. Entertainment was great and the ability to order drinks from your screen is very handy. It also means no bells going off through the flight for service. Flight attendants were pretty average. Not great but not rude. I drank a lot of Sauvignon Blanc which was delicious and from New Zealand. All in all or was an average flight. Don't know how I would have felt in the middle section of 4 seats. It clearly isn't comfortable for such a long flight so I don't understand why more airlines are installing this seating pattern.
3253,"Our flight was delayed by 5 hours from Cancun back to Calgary. Communication was very poor throughout the process. Information was not provided and the flight crew were left to deal with frustrated travellers. Air Transat could have offered complimentary snacks or even bottled water while travellers who left their all inclusive resorts were inconvenienced at a hot stuffy airport for hours being forced to purchase over priced fast food. Air Transat flights are uncomfortable with small seats even for petite people with zero entertainment, poor selection of magazines, terrible buy on board options. The only saving grace is under valued crew that are left to apologize on behalf of a sub standard airline with zero public relations skills"
3254,"The more or less punctuality of the flight (20 min. delay), and the safety where the only good things of the flight. The flight attendants were rude, the meal was tasteless and was served 1hr 45mins after take off (on a night and transatlantic flight they should be much faster like other airlines). They took my plate back 1.5 hours after I received it. The seats are uncomfortable if you are more than 1m90 tall. No individual TV screens. You have to pay in order to have a headset. Moreover, we waited 1.5 hours for our bags at Marseille Airport (not the fault of Air Transat)."
3255,"We arrived at the airport 4 hours early and the plane was already at the gate. When we boarded the entertainment system was not working and one of the toilets was out of service, the staff were very friendly and everything else was as it should be. The return flight, when we got to the airport they had changed the plane, we purposely booked that specific flight because it had a A330 on it and it was changed to a A310, the reason we booked that flight as it has the in seat entertainment system on the A330 but not on the ancient A310's they are flying. I flew with them 2 years ago and they told me then that the A310's were supposed to be gone within a year. When I got home I emailed them and I got the automatic reply but they never did contact me regarding my concerns."
3256,BEG-SVO 3 Nov 2013. Check in more organized and efficient than before since line separators were used in the terminal building. Boarding efficient and departure on time YU-ANI B733 clean and well maintained with pillows on every seat. Cabin crew in new uniforms and with good and professional attitude. Catering onboard drastically improved it starts with a printed menu distributed even in economy class. Beverage trolleys are well stocked from juice coke wines to scotch (all free of charge). Real cutlery on food trays accompanied by a nice fresh meat / cheese / egg snack yoghurt and fruit salad. All together amazing transition from the old catering serving. Arrival 10 min ahead of schedule. The only improvement could be an additional inflight announcement from the cockpit who only greeted passengers at time of departure from Belgrade.
3257,"Initially I flew with JAT Airways back in September from SKG to BEG with an extremely noisy turboprop aircraft. Either due to long service or due to bad maintenance it felt bad and the service was mediocre having two stewards with basic English and average catering. On January 11 I boarded JU523 again from SKG to BEG. I boarded an Emirates leased A319 with Air Serbia livery and had four very kind stewards. I found small pillows in Air Serbia brand on the seats and overall a huge boost in standards. I asked for a seat change due to a knee problem I had for the seats right at the emergency exit corridor and was immediately granted one. The catering from two small cupcakes in foil had changed into a paperbag with a 0.25l water bottle a paper cup and a packed sandwich with options for only cheese cheese and ham or cheese and turkey plus the trolley with the bar. Given the fact that the flight takes slightly over an hour those are excellent choices. Only minor point is the training of the personnel into the new status of the airline calling once ""Welcome onboard JAT Airways flight"" and once ""Thank you for choosing Air Serbia flight"" Overall the impression I got was as if I was in a star alliance equivalent member airline."
3258,JU 651 SVO-BEG (27th Dec). B733 YU-ANK seat 2A. Load factor 100% (both J and Y classes). Departed gate 16 min late due to late start of boarding. Cabin crew purser in early 50's but all other members significantly younger. Crew did not provide assistance with overcoats but welcome drinks served. Newspapers menu and food orders taken by purser while taxiing. Served after take off drink with warm nuts. Choice of main food between chicken with vegetables and staffed zucchini. Appetizer consisted of 2-3 shrimps and salmon. Chocolate cake for desert very tasty. Choice between 2 red and 2 white wines and good selection of aperitifs and non alcoholic drinks. Overall good meals and selection but nothing spectacular. Service was good and there is nothing to complain about but it lacked a bit of final touch to categorize it as something one remembers no refills offered (same with bread basket) but after asking I got everything. Cockpit crew made 2 announcements to welcome passengers and also gave in flight details. Arrived BEG about 15 minutes after schedule at gate A10 (operational air bridge). Luggage came in shortly but priority tag status was not observed during delivery. Overall fair rating would be 8 (out of ten). To be improved: earlier check in time of departure punctuality assistance with coats a bit more leg room appetizer could be better and a salad would be a + additional runs with bread / wine (without asking) would be nice. Absolutely not worst than AF or LH European service in business but not quite like Asian or Middle East airlines.
3259,"Flew JU656 BEG-SVO on 8/1/14. Departure on time. 100% full even though SU had a flight leaving some 20-30 minutes prior to ours. Catering in business was fantastic worth trying ""home-made meatballs and stuffed peppers"" and Serbian made Chardonnay! Purser and cabin staff very communicative and pleasant. Overall great flight and product even for a red-eye."
3260,I flew round trip to Papeete for a Paul Gauguin cruise. I will never fly that airline again. This is unfortunate for French Polynesia because it is a wonderful place and I loved my time there the the flight was unbearable. The seats are so small with no leg room so that one can hardly move. The country should subsidize the airline or another one so that passengers can visit this beautiful place without the pain associated with getting there.
3261,Flew LAX to Tahiti seats 19K/L with my wife on 23 Jan 14. Both of our entertainment systems did not work. Asked the flight attendant 3 times about it and was ignored. Finally a flight attendant indicated they could sit us in separate seats or two middle seats in the last row.
3262,A 5-hour flight from Auckland to Papeete (Business Class) was more or less ruined by a seat that wouldn't budge from the takeoff/landing bolt upright position and a fold out tray that didn't. The whole aircraft was looking very tired and tatty and badly in need of an upgrade. The Air Tahiti staff at the chaotic boarding gate in Auckland were rude and condescending although the flight attendants did the best they could in such a worn out old bus. Food was OK (I don't expect cordon bleu on a plane) but the wine choice was one cheap red or white. Take it or leave it. Entertainment was very limited too. I was told that of a fleet of 5 aircraft 4 have in fact been upgraded. I guess I found myself on the one that wasn't. Assuming the final aircraft is in fact given the major facelift it so badly needs then I'd consider using Air Tahiti Nui again as a last resort but will take Air New Zealand if it's an available alternative.
3263,AA 7176 (code share) on 1/15/14 Papeete to Los Angeles. Business class on this airline was very disappointing in comparison to other airlines we use. Because our tickets were code share we were not allowed in the business class lounge despite paying for business class fare.
3264,Flew B777-300 from Brisbane-AKL. Seat service food and were exemplary. Could not fault any point of the service. While I did not get to fully experience the flat-bed that Air New Zealand offers when I had the seat fully reclined I nearly fell asleep. This is a first. Did not use IFE although by the looks of things it was modern with a great selection of movies/TV shows.
3265,Flew on a B767-300 Short Haul. The food drink and service was substantially better than Economy with Air NZ which was excellent as I would rate Air NZ economy service highly. Great selection of modern movies and shows with IFE. The seat while dated was sufficiently comfortable for my 6'3 build. However people who have a slightly larger girth may struggle with the seat. Moving past another passenger from the window seat was also a tricky situation. However overall a very pleasant experience would certainly recommend.
3266,"Inconsistent. Good flight from LGW, average from YUL Montreal. Outbound: We paid extra for Option Plus, which on this occasion was well worth it. We avoided check-in queues, used the fast track security lane, boarded first and our baggage was given priority on arrival. It also gave us a total luggage allowance of 33kg over two bags. On board we were given a comfort kit, sparkling wine, snack and an alcoholic drink. Food was bearable - no different really to any other airline. Leg room was adequate and seats had a good recline, but they are not very wide, so it was very uncomfortable and I'm not a big person. I was concerned when I discovered the A310 doesn't have individual screens. Instead you have to watch on your iphone or tablet and there is no method of charging your device. Film choices appeared OK and battery held up surprisingly well. All in all we were pleasantly surprised, although our expectation couldn't be any lower because we had read all the negative reviews. Inbound: Long wait at check in, just one person checking in Option Plus passengers. Despite having priority security with our ticket we were ushered through main security lanes. Flight was slightly delayed. No apology or explanation in fact it wasn't even mention. Seat made it very uncomfortable and difficult to sleep. Food service was bizarre. Main pasta dish after midnight and breakfast was just a piece of banana bread! And ""priority bags"" appeared to come off at the same time as the others."
3267,"I travel frequently with Air Transat in Club Class. The service is always great and the best part is the larger seat which is great for sleeping. The food is not always the greatest and the menu has not changed in the 10 years I have flown with them, but the early boarding and extra leg room along with a dedicated washroom makes this a pleasant experience."
3268,"Overall an excellent experience. Flights on time. Totally professional and customer service focussed air crew. Friendly, helpful staff. Great cabin, good leg room, good entertainment system and choice of films. No negatives. Food ??overall, quite pleasant. Drinks service ??excellent."
3269,Travelled to Belgrade on 9th November YU 381 and returned to London on 16th November YU380. What a pleasant surprise. Food was very good and for a change it was served with proper cutlery!
3270,"London Heathrow to SKG via Belgrade return and feel disappointed. At the beginning of November my flight which I had booked in May to get a good price was rescheduled and now included a sleepover in Belgrade both ways with no accommodation offered. All 4 flights were late from 30 to 40 minutes without an explanation nor an apology offered. Cabin was very nice new and modern and staff looked professional but were mostly inattentive and got annoyed when asked to move out of the way so people could get to the toilet. Even when I asked for specific help I was ignored by several FAs. English was a problem on the flight back to Heathrow. Drinks get served by 1 member of staff to the entire cabin which takes about an hour. By the time I got my drink I had spent about 2 hours without a drink there is no option to buy any at Belgrade past security check and flight was so late. By the time we got our drinks the meal that had been served an hour before had gone cold the cheese on top of the salad had started to melt and the white wine (served in a small plastic cup) had gone warm. Some people were told ""sorry no beef left chicken only"". That was the only flight that offered a decent meal. I thought overall that a lot of effort has been made with the re-branding and it looks great but customer service is not great and there are organisational issues on board. Most disappointing was the cancellation of the daily connection between Heathrow and SKG and how we were dealt with. I will be avoiding this airline in future."
3271,TIV-BEG return economy class. Both flights operated by ATR 72 aircraft. On both legs aircraft showing age cabin dirty and seats old and cramped. One complimentary drink offered on each flight. Cabin crew very polite in spite of their age and dressed in a little bit worn out uniforms. Still the best option on this route.
3272,FRA-BEG return last week. Flight experience good quite old but clean Boeing 737-300 cabin crew was friendly. Inflight service very simple (consisted of a small cheese ham and pickles sandwich and beverages) but adequate for a 2 hours flight. Would fly with them again.
3273,Air Tahiti Nui economy class is awful - very tight cramped seats if you are tall as we are poor service and minimal cardboard food. Our section of the cabin was an oven the section behind us was a refrigerator and the cabin attendants seemed to be unable to do anything about it when you could find one to ask. My husband who is 6 ft???�was wedged into his seat to the point that the woman in front of him and the woman behind him both complained when he moved and he was unable to sleep at all. We upgraded to first class on the way home and the leg room service and food were very good but they still locked the forward toilets for most of the flight and half the reading lights did not work. We will never fly Air Tahiti Nui again.
3274,Excellent service from the flight crew and ground crew. We arrived at LAX with minutes to spare as our inbound flight was delayed 2+ hours. That airline made no effort to put us on another flight. Running all the way from Terminal 1 to Bradley searching for the ATN desk the kind young lady escorted us swiftly to the gate. We just made the flight otherwise would have spent the night in LA. Although our bags didn't make it they were delivered the next day to our hotel. Since we had no luggage when we arrived the airline gave us a nice bag with essential toiletries including T-shirt and shorts which we all sported for the next few hours. The meals were better than expected the in-flight entertainment was better than some major U.S. airlines. The waiting area in Papeete for our homebound flight was fabulous beautiful shops food comfortable lounge chairs gardens.
3275,"Flew to Auckland from Papeete. The flight was 5 hours long. I was seated in 6a wonderful smells of the toilet behind us. I found cabin staff rude and unfriendly. They closed business class toilet and told everyone to use the ones in the middle of the plane. They dropped food on my lap while serving bread didn't say sorry but offered me another one. Seats are average for business class and food is terrible. They were ""out"" of mains when they came to serve us (being in row 6). You do not get additional drinks and if you go and ask for some it's an inconvenience to the staff without a smile or polite conversation. I might sound picky but I am simply wanting something nicer than economy when you pay twice as much for a ticket. The entertainment gave you 8 new movies and a few old titles and tv programs. The seats recline but I am six foot so my feet hang off the edge. If you are travelling by yourself there is no privacy screens like Emirates or Singapore airlines."
3276,My first trip to NZ what a disappointment. Our economy seats were cramped indeed claustrophobic as the passengers in front insisted on having their seats fully reclined for the majority of both legs of the journey to Auckland effectively preventing use of the inflight entertainment system. The cabin temperature was very cool and we were advised by staff that this was ongoing problem with this particular aircraft. The food quality was at best average comparable to budget airlines servicing Europe. That said the selection of wines offered is very good. The first leg of the return journey was made more bearable by purchasing a Skycouch option but should one have to do this on an ultra long distance flight? Reluctantly we will have to consider other carriers for our next trip.
3277,SYD-RAR NZ60 with a purchased one up. Being an old 767 seats were comfortable enough but nothing to write home about. Generally overall disappointing and have had better seats food and service in Y+ on 773. There was no amenity pack supplied and I had to ask for a toothbrush. That said staff themselves were friendly enough if not overtly taking the initiative with food and drinks!
3278,NZ745 RAR-AKL then NZ709 AKL-SYD both in Y. Full-ish flights and friendly enough crews. F&B were good as far as they went but service was slow with an apparent reluctance to offer more than 1 drink with the works. Seats were bog standard Y for 320 but it does seem that seats on all airlines in Y get smaller as I get older! As a use of Airpoints this was good value for money.
3279,"Yet again Air Transat have changed a flight time on me. It seems they regularly change their departure times after you purchase your ticket. This time it was brought forward 5 hours making it impossible for me to make the connection. Their response is ""it happens"" and can happen up to 24 hours before departure. Either pay a change fee or wait to see it it changed again. They really don't have any customer service. Its all about the contract. I appreciate sometimes due to flight volumes at an airport minor changes occur, but Air Transat do it regularly and by significant amounts. My advice would be not to book with them unless you are flexible with you dates (up to 24 hrs before departure) or have no connecting flight."
3280,"I found the service very mediocre, we were delayed for nearly 2 hours in Toronto. On the 24th of June we were due to take off at 9.55pm and it took until 10.20/30 for the pilot to tell us we were delayed due to the fact that they need a tyre changed on the aeroplane! This was not too much of a problem but time went on and we were not offered any refeshments while waiting for takeoff. It was hot and stuffy, and it was only when several passengers started asking for water, including myself, that they decided to go around with a jug of water and small plastic glasses. The plane did not take off until 11.55. We got dinner at 1.00am in the morning and breakfast was a slice of cake and a hot dinner, who has cake for breakfast! I know its any economy airline, but surely refreshments should have been offered if the plane was delyed and what nutritional value does cake have for breakfast?"
3281,"I flew 'Club' class with Air Transat 01/07/15, from LGW to YYZ. Although they call it Club, it is in actuality Premium Economy, and  I was very impressed. The seat is comfortable. The food plentiful and tasty. Flight Attendants were friendly and welcoming. Great selection of movies and tv shows on demand on a good sized screen."
3282,LHR-Belgrade-LHR in business. Alitalia lounge at Heathrow was quiet and pleasant with adequate facilities. Onboard the 737 business was in a dedicated cabin with three rows of seats in a 2x2 config. These are old-style first class seats with plenty of leg room. Pre-flight juice and water offered sparkling wine on request. FA?™s busy and courteous. Food ordinary airline food served in massive portions ??a Serbian characteristic. Crew generous with wine and other drinks. Cabin was full but with all that space you hardly noticed. All in all it made me nostalgic for the days when most business classes in Europe were like this ??ie a sufficiently different experience to warrant the higher price. JAT?™s price is roughly Â£500 as opposed to BA Â£800 on the same route. Only slight disappointment was the funereal business lounge at Belgrade (tatty purple leather sofas) but even that offered a waitress service of drinks and snacks. Would definitely fly JAT business again.
3283,We flew from LAX to Papeete and back. We were in a recently remodelled plane but the seats were terrible. They were tightly packed with very little leg room which is the norm. However the back was curved into a concave shape which was agony on a 8.5 hour flight. The headrests exacerbated the problem and my wife's wouldn't even stay up. The cushions were also stiff. There was no power outlet for the seats.
3284,Fight from LAX to PPT. After a full day of US flights from RDU to MSP to LAX we were quite exhausted. A couple of those flights were late and the older planes were packed. So we were hoping for a change of pace on our 8.5 hour flight from LAX to PPT - and we were not disappointed! The A349 was impeccable. We were in coach but the seats were roomy the flight staff was extremely friendly and we had brand new inflight entertainment systems (I think the entire cabin had recently been redone). The experience got our first trip to French Polynesia off to a great start. Yeah it's still tough to sleep in coach seats but the great experience made it bearable. And of course there's nothing like waking up having a good French breakfast and landing in Tahiti with the anticipation of a luxurious vacation ahead! You really have no other options for flying to Tahiti but who cares - Air Tahiti Nui rocked it!
3285,Flew economy round-trip Los Angeles - Papeete. Flights on time on nice aircraft. Economy seating is good and inflight service was excellent. Although aircraft are the same on the return flight got an aircraft that had been reconfigured with their new seats and touch screen videos and was quite nice.
3286,TN 102 PPT-LAX 3/16/2013 Economy Seat 27B. Departed PPT 15 minutes late for no apparent reason. Told we could not check luggage through to DFW. Entertainment screen control did not work properly - also controls overhead reading light. We were skipped for our dinner initially. Attendant seemed bothered that we asked for dinner. Dinner was inedible. Cold slices of meat hard as shoe soles bread that could not be cut. Asked for Diet Coke was told only water was available. Arrived in LAX 15 minutes late. Still had 3 hours to make our connection to DFW. Over an hour before our luggage was available to go through customs. Because we could not check the luggage in PPT had to carry our luggage from the International terminal to AA. Only in LAX does a 3 and 1/4 hour connection become a nail biter we have always had problems at LAX making connections.
3287,"MEL-CHC-WLG on A320. Booked and paid for Exit Row seats on the Works and it was fantastic. Seats were ok but extra legroom a real advantage. Water offered after take off and then given a choice of a frittata with bacon and sausages or a healthy fruit breakfast. The flight team were great and had a laugh with the passengers. Movies were also great to watch and the inflight system with movies and map a gem. Arrived in Christchurch on time and went through customs etc. Collected bag and walked to domestic terminal for flight to Wellington. Lounge in Christchurch was great. Excellent choice of food and drinks. Boarded flight to Wellington on an old 737-300 which was in pristine condition. Crew were great on what turned out to be a 25 min flight. Overall a great flight with an excellent team. Just hope they can get rid of the ""self"" check in arrangements at most airports. Go back to some personalised service."
3288,NZ90 777-200 from Japan to Auckland. Business class. Plane was almost on time departing. Food was dreadful - in the last 18 months the food on AIR NZ has taken a serious nosedive - dinner so poor that I didn't bother with breakfast. Service was the usual indifference. Entertainment system is a joke and the plane is grubby. Only good thing is the lie flat bed - best approach when flying on the 777-200 is to eat at the airport then lie down and sleep the whole flight!
3289,NZ443 Auckland to Wellington on 18 April 2014. The seating on this flight was comfortable enough but the connection from an international to a domestic flight at Auckland airport really needs to be improved (though this is obviously not the fault of Air New Zealand). The flight itself however was delayed and no calls were made about the delay until 40 minutes after the scheduled departure time. Better communication is needed.
3290,Pleasantly suprised. Old A310 (thought it was going to be an A330). Check in fairly uncomplicated at Toronto. Great deal on bringing bikes to Europe C$30 (counts as your 2nd bag in Business). Crew friendly on board. Meal was ok. Seat like the the old J class on mainline carriers. I suspect that when it works its great any delays or problems and then you are kind of stuck (charter airline) Fare was pretty good. I have yet to try Premium economy on Lufthansa but will do so later this year. Some better deal on Lounge access would be an added touch.
3291,"The check in system in Toronto does not work, more so when multiple flight are departing to UK within hours of each other. I requested to be fast forwarded as after waiting in huge queue I was within 45 mins of take off. I was eventually granted my wish, but when I got to customs I was met with another huge queue. By the time I got through security my name was being called for the flight which I almost missed. Due to lateness checking in my suitcase it has gone missing. I suggest seperate check in desks for UK destinations up untill flight departures"
3292,"I have flown Air Transat quite a few times now and this was the first in their new planes. They have good leg space although the seats are narrow - narrowest I've ever experienced in a flight. It does not bother me personally but for a broader person this can be a real issue. They have upgraded their old entertainment system to something on par with AF/BA/KLM now, however that is only in the renovated planes. The food is as bad as it was, but I'd say that for the price this is to be expected. I never have any expectations regarding the food they will serve so I'm not disapointed. They are usually still the cheapest for CDG to YUL so if I wanted something a tad better I'd pay a bit more. The service is alright, of course it has nothing to do with 5-Star airlines but I'd say its decent for the price - and it has improved since the first times I flew with them 4 years ago."
3293,My luggage was received two days late in Papeete. Reason: The aircraft was already overloaded when my connection flight from Sydney arrived Auckland. My luggage remained in Auckland that day. On arrival in Papeete there was no assistance at all to passengers without luggage. There was only one person (for about 30 passengers) recording the missing luggage and it took after a late arrival another two hours before we could leave the airport to get some sleep. There was no apology from the airline. The return flight was four hours delayed and the waiting time in Papeete airport was hell. We had to pay for very expensive airport food. WIFI connection did not work and informing relatives about late arrival was impossible. There was little to no information on the reason and what the measures would be and no help from the ground staff. It almost appeared like a cover up. We missed our connecting flights and had later been booked to other flights. Again information was not available from the cabin crew during the flight and only in Auckland we where told to what connecting flight we had been re-booked. A very troublesome check out and check in with going through the immigration twice in Auckland had to be endured.
3294,LAX to PPT on TN101 and returned a week later on TN18. Boarding at LAX less then enjoyable. Sent first to one gate then to another. Don't know if the airline or LAX is to blame there. Once boarding started we were put on buses to go to a satellite boarding point. Main terminal under construction. Inconvenient but it works. Onboard cabin staff were friendly and helpful. First time on an A340. Once in the air the flight went smoothly. The plane was clean. The 2 meals served were adequate in size and somewhat above average as far as airline food goes. Service was good. A red-eye flight in economy class seats is not going to produce quality sleep. The seats were about as comfortable as you would expect which isn't saying an awful lot. Entertainment system was marginal. I never expect much when flying economy but the service and meals were better than expected. Outbound flight departed and arrived on time. Return departed and arrived early. Our bags arrived when we did.
3295,TN 102 from AKL to PPT over last weekend. A very full flight. Punctual in terms of Departure and Arrival. Was given a seat in the last row despite checking in 3hrs in advance. Seat comfort was good. Staff were a mixed bag. Some were exceptionally friendly whilst others gave the impression they would be somewhere else. IFE was non AVOD and lacked choice and content. Food and Drinks were good and plentiful.
3296,LAX-PPT Business Class. Great ambience nice tropical feel as soon as you step on the plane. Normal modern business class seats (not the newest 100% recline ones but plenty of leg room and comfort). Food was very good as well. I recommend flying with them.
3297,I fly Air NZ 8-10 times a year mostly domestic / trans-tasman flights. On domestic routes it's a no brainer. Main routes are serviced by almost brand new A320s and the rest by fairly new Q300's and ATR 72's. All crew members (like all kiwis) are very polite and helpful. Only downside is very basic food/beverage service (coffee/tea + water + cookie) on domestic flights. Long haul not so flash compared to eg Singapore Airlines or Emirates but still decent standard. Heaps of discounted domestic flights if you buy in advance.
3298,Business Class LAX to Auckland and return. Food is marginal at best. They served a hamburger! Awful. Staff not very helpful or friendly. Seats are not that good. Lie flat is cramped and overheated and not comfortable. Nothing good to say about this airline. I thought US airlines couldn't hack it internationally. Never again.
3299,Melbourne-Sydney-Port Vila-Melbourne. Flew Qantas to connect with flight to Port Vila. Old style seats in Business with not much recline but not a real problem for a 3hr flight. Service was excellent with a choice of 2 main courses for lunch and drinks were promptly offered. Cabin crew were typically Vanuatuan - smiling and courteous and they really seemed to enjoy their job. Inflight entertainment was interesting the first time around but then repeated well into the flight! Perhaps they could upgrade this aspect. A word of warning when checking in at Port Vila for a flight out. Checked in 2 hours prior to flight for Melbourne but then kept waiting for security and immigration to open the door for nearly 45 mins in a very warm (non-airconditioned) airport. Lounge at Port Vila mall but at least air conditioned but only packets of chips to eat. Overall it was a most pleasant flight with a great crew on all legs.
3300,"Flight home a bit of an ordeal. Check in was meant to open at 14.30 but didn't open until 15.30. We were all on plane for 18.30 but plane did not leave stand until 19.30. Pilot told us it was to do with paper work (can he not read or write) or was it because we were waiting on an engineer to tighten a screw on one of the first class seats head rests, when there were several other empty seats. On landing in Glasgow the luggage took an hour to come through. However the cabin crews luggage managed to come through without delay. Might look at other airlines next time"
3301,"Our flight from Calgary to Glasgow was a mixed bag. Just as we were flying over Hudson Bay, the pilot turn a sharp southerly turn and we diverted to Toronto. With no additional information other than ""technical difficulties"" due to ""improper checks in Calgary"" they were going to have to transfer us to another plane in Toronto. Our flight from Toronto to Glasgow was pretty uneventful. Our return flight was also uneventful, thankfully. I appreciate the lighting and ambient music that seems to play as boarding and de-planing takes place. It can really add to a zen atmosphere and help people who might be having some pre-flying jitters. One thing to note, Air Transat: get your food situation together! Each flight, we ended up basically getting the worst they had to offer meal-wise because none of the decent food was left as everyone before us had opted for it. I was not at all impressed by this. We booked seats towards the back of the plane to avoid screaming children as best as we could, only to suffer as far as meal options went. Be prepared to need more of the food you know people prefer. It just seems kind of cruel otherwise, subjecting the back 1/3 to 1/2 of the plane to the runs serving them the slop that's leftover."
3302,"I had read some of the reviews, so was a little concerned, but loved the price. There was no charge for our luggage! We got lunch, with a complimentary glass of wine at no extra cost. We also got a snack shortly before descending into Vancouver. The entertainment was in the seatback in front of me. Movies, TV shows, etc, again, no extra cost."
3303,Seats are showing some wear and tear. Torn at points and armrest cover hinges feel stuck at times. The entertainment controls on the armrest are worn-out yet still functional. Adjustment of seats: they lack sufficient recline. Controls are placed at hip level inside the chair so poorly accessible. Putting 2 pillows under your feet to raise them makes it better but raising the feet with a pillow will put your toes up against the back of the reclined seat in front of you. I deliberately chose a middle section seat this allows you to always exit without climbing over or being climbed over. The seat rows are that close together that undisturbed passing is impossible. The lumber supports do not work on this flight. Flight entertainment system is Archaic. You don't have the option of starting your movie on demand. The quality of the LCD screen is best described as a snowy CRT up close. The movies continue during PA announcements and since all are continuously playing there is no chance of rewinding. There are no air vents above the seat only general air conditioning. No power output in business class. This is consistent with the age of the seats. Sufficiently equipped courtesy pouch with toothbrush and paste eye covers ear plugs and socks. Headphones supplied are comfortable for the first couple of hours. There was simply no noise cancellation. Service is attentive and correct although the personal touch was missing the second flight. Timely serving and offering of drinks.
3304,LAX-PPT in Business Class. Business Class departure lounge in LAX shared with several other airlines. Nice lounge with free snacks and drinks. Boarding gate was a bit far away we were bussed to the aircraft. First and Business Class customers were boarded in a separate bus. Once onboard - very comfortable. Before take-off drinks offered. Several uniform changes during the 8.5 hour flight. Our flight left LAX on time. As previously noted - business class seats do not fully recline and when you do recline - it protrudes in to the space of the person sitting behind you. Not the best lay out - but certainly adequate. Good meal service and friendly/attentive flight attendants. Return PPT-LAX - same on time departure and arrival and good inflight service.
3305,"Scheduled to fly non-stop Paris-Los Angeles. At the check-in counter the sign said 'New York' we were told the flight to LA was simply making a quick stop in New York then would continue to LA. This was a lie. Upon arrival in New York we were told it would be 24 hours until another plane would take us to LA. They put us up in a hotel. 24 hours later it was a charter flight they put us on to LA. I complained to Air Tahiti Nui about the lack of meal and I was told ""we went to a very big expense to charter this flight you should be grateful"". I should be grateful they arranged me transportation to where I paid to go?"
3306,Paris CDG to Los Angeles. Good food crew entertainment and leg space. I enjoyed the whole island theme that was experienced onboard. A plus about the entire experience was the level of visibility and attention the crew provided with frequent water runs and prompt responses to call bell. Another feature was the snack bar set up at the galley for passengers. Flight departed and arrived on time.
3307,Just flew from LAX to AKL on ANZ in business class. It is what business class should be like. Very attentive staff although the food is getting a bit downgraded and staff at the LAX lounge are just okay I think the majority of staff are now subcontractors so do not have the Kiwi values except for long term staff. Air NZ needs to be careful not to try and squeeze out too much profit yet is still offers one of the best business classes in the field. Just fly UAL from Sydney and see how they have not really upped their game. I wish they would match AirNZ.
3308,"My husband and I flew San Francisco to Auckland NZ 7 on 30th March. Flight delayed due to an electrical fault due to board at 7.45pm but were eventually seated at 10.15e. Then informed that the paperwork required to had not been produced and waited a further 1 hour 45 mins this at least gave the pilot time to reboot the entertainment units which weren't working. We had purchased seats with extra leg room which had the entertainment units folded into the seat frame. We were aware that the units would have to be folded away during take off and as the system required rebooting we entertained ourselves by reading. As the safety instruction began a stewardess suddenly snapped at us to ""please pay attention to the safety video"" which she only then seemed to realise we hadn't accessed. My husband however was quite happy to follow the video right up to the point where you're asked to check if you've turned all your electrical equipment to flight mode. It was at this point that the stewardess roundly set upon him as he as per instruction checked his iPod. It was demanded that he turn it off immediately followed by a barked demand to know if he'd done so. This set the tone for the rest of the flight. At no stage before or during our flight did we say or do anything to warrant this sort of attitude. Also my husbands entertainment systems kept cutting out during the flight. I'd like to say that the ground staff who rescheduled our connecting flight and the members of that crew were great."
3309,AKL-PER in the 3x3x3 configuration. As regular Perth trippers (like 25 over 20 years) it was one of the most uncomfortable disappointing trips we have experienced. One needs to be almost a contortionist to extricate oneself for toilet visits due to 2 things. One is the closeness of the seat in front when it is reclined coupled with the fact that the intermediate arm rest will not lift high enough to get around comfortably but having achieved that one still has to negotiate around the aisle arm rest which would not lift at all! My wife and I are not high body-mass people! Food quality was definitely not up to previous standards. Trying to play a favourite CD became a rather user/unfriendly mission and when I did get it it was punctuated and disjointed. On disembarking we eyed the PE seats with new interest and are contemplating an upgrade on our return but it shouldn't have to be like that. We get the feeling that passenger comfort/satisfaction in the standard economy class has been compromised by the extreme pressure the airline is under to return a satisfactory performance to the shareholders. We remain loyal to our own airline but are seriously questioning the cost.
3310,AKL-VLI in economy. Check in at AKL was handled by Air NZ staff who were friendly and accommodating. Flight was quite empty so despite having an economy ticket I was treated to a whole row to myself. The 737 in use on this route is clearly well used but in good order and clean. The cabin crew are warm friendly and helpful. The meal service was quite efficient and consisted of a beef stew with mash and boiled carrots. Simple hot and tasty though I imagine not to everyone's liking the other option available was fish. Sides included a salad bread roll and cheesecake for dessert. A good selection of complimentary beverages is offered throughout the flight. The real winner was a complimentary glass of champagne: this was neither solicited nor is it normal practice for the economy class passengers but for whatever reason the crew decided to treat me on this particular flight. Inflight entertainment is drop down screens with a video of some sort but I find it difficult to see the screens so I didn't even bother and read a book instead. Upon arrival in VLI disembarking was via airstairs to the tarmac. The terminal facilities are simple but functional. Luggage was quite slow this time.
3311,NF21 from Brisbane to Port Vila. 26 Jan 2014. Yep most of the reviews are right - old fashioned service average food but lots of it no decent inflight entertainment (other than the magazine which is really good). The video on Vanuatu is a good intro to the country but that's about it. Old re-runs of American sitcoms that keep freezing. Cabin crew fantastic especially with kids.
3312,"Old fashioned service - great crew on a decent 737. Only let down was the TV entertainment and food - the screens are only every few rows so you can't see much without binoculars. What we could see the video kept jumping or freezing and when we asked the crew they responded with ""it happens all the time"". Beef stroganoff on a flight to a tropical island? What are they thinking? Drinks were free flowing though."
3313,NF 50 and 51 VLI-AKL return. 23 and 30 Oct. What a pleasant surprise to fly with a good old fashioned full service airline very punctual good service drinks trolley nice lunch with more wine top up round of drinks then choose of port or liqueur. Only problem is that the airport is hopeless and can't handle a full plane load for either arrival or departure. Leaving was a nightmare.
3314,"Had paid double price to upgrade to Club Class on way out, all was fine no problems. As we could not get into Club Class on the way back we paid an additional Â£48 at the Airport in Glasgow to Canadian Affair to travel Select Plus which means chosen seats, speedy check in, priority luggage, free soft drinks, headsets, etc in flight. Problems began at check in, took over 35 mins due to ""system errors"" eventually we were given two different seat numbers not our original seats. My son who was travelling with a sprained ankle and who is 6ft 4 had a broken seat, two rows from the back toilets (seats we would never have chosen). We pointed this out to the crew who tried to fix it but could not. We were advised we could not get our original seats as other people had paid for them and did not want to move. My son had to sit bolt upright for 6.5hrs. All this and more has been brought to the attention of Canadian Affair (who we have used at least 7 times in the past five years to fly to Toronto). Firstly offered me Â£30 then when I said this was not good enough took another 3 weeks to write back to me with all manner of excuses. If you can dont fly with this Company, fly Air Canada instead."
3315,"Despite some reviews on this site and others my experience with Air Transat was very pleasant. Yes the seats are a bit crowded together but that's par for the course on almost every airline these days. Food was better that expected it was quite good. In flight entertainment had a decent variety of current movies and TV shows to suite all ages and tastes. Quick check in, pleasant staff especially the flight attendants the service was very good. Would recommend Air Transat."
3316,I just returned from about an 8 hour flight from Europe via Air Transat and I will never do this again. I have been flying to Europe for about 20 years and this was the most uncomfortable flight. For a long trip the seats are horrible if you are bigger then average or even if you are sitting next to people bigger then average and you have just entered air plane hell if you are caught in a middle seat. The food quality and quantity were also totally unacceptable. It was so bad that I would take a more non direct flight in the future at a higher price to avoid this experience again.
3317,LAX-PPT-LAX over Christmas and New Year. Both trips were red-eyes. Outbound from LAX check-in was cheerful and set the tone for the journey. On the down side passengers are bussed to the aircraft and ATN staff lost complete control of the process resulting in a scrum to get on the busses. Onboard we passed on the meal offering and slept. The hot breakfast was welcome. Arrivals Hall was chaos and a 1 hour delay to get through Immigration awaited us. Returning the Departures Area is new spacious but very warm. Boarding went well as our seats were in Row 44 we made our way to the desk 10 minutes before boarding to avoid the chaos we experienced outbound at LAX. Once again pleasant and efficient crew. In summary our flights were good the only warning I would make is that in Economy the seat pitch is only 31 inches and on an 8 hour flight if you are over 6 ft tall this is not comfortable at all.
3318,Flying 3/4 times every year since 2008 my last experience was very disappointing. Besides domestic there is no traffic during the day at Papeete Faaa airport and then late at night they schedule 3 international flights all due to leave within a short hour and this airport can't handle it. I arrived 4 hours before departure and the line for check-in immigration and luggage check were endless. I was booked on TN8 seat 11A to Paris via LAX and after pulling out we came back to the parking stand because of an engine problem. We were told it would take an extra 3 hours to change it. They decided to serve us the light cold snack. The previous times I flew we used to have a full hot meal with wine it is obvious ATN is cutting costs and service. Finally airborne 4 hours behind schedule we were expecting to be served a round of drinks but nothing on this 8 hours flight until an hour before touching down in LAX they served us breakfast. The 11 hour flight to Paris went without problem but no round of water or drinks served between lunch and breakfast. Unfortunately due to the monopoly ATN has on these routes I will have no choice but to fly with them again.
3319,LAX-CDG and CDG-LAX several times in past 3 years. I appreciate the little flower they give when entering the plane. On the latest trip staff walk through the cabin several times through the flight but the call light was ignored or they were too busy with helping someone else. I never did like plane food so this one was no different. Person sitting in front of me had their seats reclined right back so it was hard to place my food on the tray. The steward serving food saw and told him to put his seat up.
3320,Los Angeles to Paris return. We boarded our flight with high expectations however we were sorely disappointed. While others could check 2 pieces of luggage free we were allowed only one. We had been told to expect seats that were roomier with more leg room than other airlines but we were as crowded as on any low-cost airline. Onboard the service was poor and the food quality was poor. Attendants came down the aisle infrequently to offer snacks. The flight itself was fine and on-time but we agreed we would not fly this airline again.
3321,NZ288 from Shanghai to Auckland on B777-200 in Business Class seats 3A and 3B - very good comfort in sleeping in case of flat bed seating comfort good. Staff very friendly and professional. Catering - not really a positive surprise perhaps in case of the Shanghai route hard oriented to Chinese food and not New Zealand. However if you're booked on the 777 it's ok if the flight is operated on the 767-300 - forget it ! The flight back from Auckland to Shanghai (12 hours) was really poor on the very narrow recliner seats of the old 767Â´s.
3322,"ANZ 289 from Auckland to Shanghai - this time on Boeing 767-300 in Business Class. Seat 2A and 2B. Seat quality - poor as the seats are too narrow! The monitors are stored in the middle armrest that leads to a very small seat less felt wide as in ECO. Recliner would be ok but the width is very poor for a 12 hours flight in Business Class! Team great food - in case of the Shanghai trip very ""Chinese oriented"" and not typical for ANZ hopefully. So if the flight is done by a 767-300 - avoid! The 777-200 seat quality is much better."
3323,We travelled from Auckland to San Francisco on Air New Zealand's 747. This was a non stop flight and although the food and service were ok only the entertainment system was extremely disappointing. It was antiquated - limited movies music games and news. The push button hand control needed extra pressure going over. On the return flight it was not possible to get any music at all. The system was rebooted (nothing); I was taken to two other seats (still no music). Compared to Emirates' flights this experience with Air NZ was extremely disappointing.
3324,Flew NF 30/31 from MEL-VLI on the 737-800. Nice leather seating. Very clean plane. However time for new seat cover as the leather from around the seat pocket is coming off. Foot rest would be nice but its only 4 hrs. Food was great includes potato chips (starter) salad main meal bread and a cheesecake dessert. Staff service was great (even though a staff member spilt soft drink on me). Crew member was very apologetic and provided great service to all passengers. All other crew members were great as well and very happy to sell us duty free. However entertainment was non existent.
3325,Flight Auckland to Port Vila. Left on time. Fast service and nice crew. Would fly with them again. Only poor aspects were the entertainment which is almost not existent and the meals. There is room for improvement.
3326,Flew Port Vila to Auckland on NF50 flight departed on time and arrived 25 minutes early. Food was great for breakfast and the crew were very friendly. The crew are excellent and always willing to share their experience with you. Fantastic little airline and I look forward to flying with them again soon.
3327,Traveled from Auckland to Port Vila. Requested seats in row 3 and the request was confirmed at time of check in. Seats are good with plenty of leg and the TV. Cabin crew were a little bit on the grumpy side. The food was nice although they didn't have the requested vegetarian meal I ordered. Seats were comfortable. Landing into Port Vila is a very fast one but the views on approach are excellent. Can't complain much because we arrived 25 minutes early.
3328,"Bought upgrade at check-in. Superb value. It was only Â£200 for the upgrade to their business class. It is actually only a premium economy class but it was excellent. Brilliant service, very good food and very comfortable new seating. I was flying Manchester to Toronto which I do quite regularly."
3329,I paid for an upgrade on my flight from Manchester to Toronto. My wife and I fly this route frequently with Transat. This is simple. The service level in the mini business section (only 12 seats) was excellent. Given the very reasonable cost it was superb value. The service and comfort cannot be compared to business class in the top airlines but the value for money compared to others is remarkable. The business class section has recently been completely refitted and is very comfortable. Two months ago I travelled on the upper deck of a 747 with BA London to Dallas and the service today was much better than the flag carrier.
3330,LAX-Tahiti. We were informed by our travel agent about the strike and had to switch out flight from LAX-Tahiti. When we got to LAX we had to wait 3 hrs in line before we could get our boarding passes. We received very little information regarding the delay. The service agents stood there and looked at you but had no answers. This was a horrible experience. The best part of the night was when the Air New Zealand crew showed up. They chartered Air New Zealand to take us to Tahiti. That crew and flight was wonderful. On the way home from Tahiti the strike was over so we had Air Tahiti Nui for the flight home. The service on the fight was horrible. If you put on your call light they would ignore you.
3331,Paris-LAX The plane was immaculate staff friendly and food was fabulous! We were given a menu two hot meals and snacks during the flight. If we needed something else we were able to go to the galley and ask for ice cream or drinks at no charge. It was a long flight from Paris to LA but it was very comfortable and didn't feel like 12 hours because of the service.
3332,"CDG to LAX. The cabin was very cramped and hot throughout the flight but service and food was quite good and a real surprise after our experience on the ground. We arrived two hours ahead of time at CDG. After it took over an hour (about 75 minutes) to check in we then got in line next to go through security. After waiting about 30 minutes and becoming very concerned about them shutting the doors before we got through I asked the now idle check-in people if there was a way to get us through so we would not miss the flight. The manager very dismissively told us to get to the back of the line there was nothing he could do. After another 20 minutes with a security agent telling us to just have an airline rep walk us to 1st class line and being told again by the to just go back to the end of the line a security agent walked us to another area and through 1st class line. We were very surprised when we got onboard to see the same inept and rude people who did check-in were the first class and business class stewards. All they had to say to us when I said I was worried about missing the flight was ""We know you are here checked-in and in line for security. We won't leave without you."" Instead rudeness and attitude was all I got."
3333,NZ8 AKL to SFO departure was delayed as the air conditioning wasn't working on the ground when we got on the plane was still warm. Video system was not working so attendant suggested using middle seat screen but aisle seat passenger had to use it as his audio was not working. After waiting 30 mins turns out it was working but no one bothered to advise me it had been reset. Crew couldn't turn down overhead lights after meal and surprisingly comment cards never appeared for feedback. Sent an email 5 days ago & no response. 747 looked worn out.
3334,I have travelled on a number of occasions from Melbourne to Christchurch and have much admired the unique qualities of that experience as an introduction to NZ. On the last occasion this was on a code sharing flight with Virgin. The experience reversed my previous appreciation of the introduction to NZ. The best of NZ Airlines seems to have been undermined by the worst of Virgin. I watched an Air NZ ground staff member stand by and instruct my wife to load her weighty suitcase on to the luggage belt before I could intervene. My wife had spent the previous two days undergoing heart check ups. Furthermore I was impressed to note the speed with which the ground staff requested an extra 80 dollars for an extra bag when it was reasonably evident that the extra bag could have been packed into the non-extra one. Please note that the comment rating relates to the experience in the code sharing flight with Virgin.
3335,"Flight NZ 8046 Christchurch to Wellington 19 March 2014. Our flight yesterday went beyond just ""good service"" it was excellent service. This is not necessarily because anything out of the ordinary happened on our flight but rather because our Air New Zealand pilots and cabin attendant just did the ordinary things particularly well. No fuss no bother just professionalism. We felt comfortable happy and safe and when it is all said and done that's why one chooses to fly with a particular airline."
3336,I flew from SFO to Auckland. The entertainment system is phenomenal. I did not run out of movies to choose from the whole plane ride was not enough for me to watch all the movies available unlike the other airlines with limited movies. Other airlines like United charges for entertainment access (ridiculous). The food is filling and the unlimited wine helped. The seats are very comfy with plenty of leg room the only problem is getting out when the people seating in front of you all have their seats reclined it gets pretty tricky. Nevertheless I will certainly chose Air New Zealand again if given the chance.
3337,Sydney to Vila in September 2012. Incoming flight was delayed due to headwinds but the same winds then had us landing earlier than scheduled though the landing in Vila seems to be a very fast one. Plane getting a bit tired inside but great staff. The food was good for international economy and the wine and beers really kept flowing. Overall very good service much better than a recent trip on Air Pacific.
3338,Brisbane to Santo and back in August 2012. Flight slightly delayed due to 'missing spare part'. Service on board very good and smiling good food good beverage selection. Same applies to return flight although it was slightly scary to see that your luggage does not get x-rayed in Santo: a smiley woman asks you to open your bag and performs a visual check. Would travel again as friendly and efficient and reasonable prices.
3339,Food service on flight from Sydney to Port Vila very slow. Fight was 2 hours under way before we received our meal with no choice as to what we wanted. Connecting flight from Vila to Santo delayed one hour and luggage was left behind. Our return flight was as equally disappointing my wife and I were seated together on flight from Santo to Vila with my daughter and then the flight from Villa to Sydney on the same aircraft my wife I were allocated seats apart from each other. This fight was not full but the cabin service was better than our flight over. Even though the flight was not full when I got my food I again was not given a choice in fact staff had trouble finding me a dinner. I have flown Air Vanuatu several times in the past and was very happy with the service but this time was very disappointing.
3340,SYD-Villa. Crew were nice and helpful and the food served was great. Seats are comfortable with good recline. However they could improve entertainment the video is only about Vanuatu and gets boring after a while. The audio was okay. Other then that a good small airline.
3341,Just returned from Vancouver to London on a direct flight in club class. We were surprised and pleased with the level of service and the constant supply of food and drink the food was very good. The stewardess was very pleasant and professional. The airfares are much lower than other airlines. Those who complain about minor issues your not in a 5 star hotel for a week remember it's a cheap flight you've booked for a few hours travel. Pay a much higher price with a premium airline next time and then make a comparison. We will book again with Air Transat for our next trip to Canada.
3342,On the outbound flight the interior of the plane seemed to be poorly maintained. The seatback it front was bent and twisted this made it difficult to raise or lower the tray. The passenger in front kept trying to get it to recline with the help of the flight attendant by pushing on it which caused it to bend more. The audio jack didn't work so there was no sound to watch the movie. On the return flight Air Transat uses Enerjet. The plane was a 737 the legroom was terrible & I'm average hight. Also the plane wasn't equipped with entertainment so no music or movie for a 6 hour trip. This was a surprise as their website indicates they provide movies on their international flights.
3343,My trip was YYZ-PUJ (Punta Cana) May 9 out and 16 back. I have nothing but praise for this airline. Our flights were boarded on time and departed as such. The onboard service was exceptional friendly crew beautifully spacious A330 and fantastic entertainment package. Seats were comfortable and did not get the feeling of being cramped.
3344,"On the way to the airport in Tahiti (flight to LA) we were told the flight was cancelled becasue the pilots just went on strike no one seemed to know anything. My mother who is 89 was ill and needed to get back to the US so I called Air Tahiti and they said they could get us on Air France the next morning and to be at the airport at 4:30 am which we did. We did not have seats on Air France as promised and we were told to wait for the Air Tahiti rep who did not show up until 6:30 am. I told her that Air Tahiti had promised us seats on air france due to a medical emergency and she said ""I didn't work yesterday and I cannot help you"" and slammed the door in my face. I knocked on the door and she came out and I got exactly the same response. She was so incredibly rude considering we had been sitting on the ground in the airport for 2 hrs. Luckily we got on stand by to LA which was not our final destination. We lost all of our connecting flights. which delayed medical treatment. I would not recommend them to anyone."
3345,Once on the plane it was great but ground team was horrible and inept. We boarded at LAX for CDG and were amazed at the lack of urgency or customer concern. As the plane sat empty and the gate agent sat talking on her cell phone we all looked on amazed. 45 minutes after we were scheduled to board she announced we would be boarding 15 minutes late due to the plane arriving late - although it had been parked at the gate for hours as we waited. Clearly she had not looked at a clock. This caused us to depart over an hour late. Unfortunately we were on this trip during the Iceland Volcano Eruption. Air Tahiti once again proved how little they cared. I called the airlines 3 times about a flight only to be hung up on by the attendent. Once we had a flight we were told to be at the Airport 4 hours ahead of time due to the challenge from the Volcano. We arrived 4 hours early but the agents did not. We all (350 of us) waited in line. When they did show up it took them 45 minutes to get ready have coffee chat laugh joke and enjoy themselves all in front of us without any communication with us. Zero urgency or concern for all of us who had been waiting days to get on a plane. Once ticketed we went to the gate plane was there flight crew was there but not gate agents for hours we waited until they showed up and even longer while they organized themselves. It was like a circus show watching them. The whole ordeal was so ridiculous and unnecessary. The ground team has no care or concern or urgency for the passenger. I will never fly this airline again. They didn't earn any stars with us.
3346,PPT-AKL. Crew gracious and friendly. Huge evidence of cost cutting in food but wine and drinks selection still good. They need new seats - if person in front reclines fully there is no chance of any movement. Crew attention to safety is impressive.
3347,LAX-CDG First Class Seat 1D. A340. Small private cabin with only 6 seats. The crew professional and courteous. Food and wine decent. Lie flat seat very dated and more comparable to Business Class. Poor selection of movies most at least 10 years old.
3348,Regular ANZ flyer most recently SYD-AKL 7th Feb 2014 then WEL-SYD 12th Feb. Seat+Bag ticket. SYD-AKL on larger plane (777). Boarding was an issue - boarding gate too small for size of plane/number of passengers and then many passengers started queuing up before boarding called which meant that boarding by row numbers was a bit pointless. Onboard all good as usual although was very cold and I had to get a blanket also I'm a bit sick of the Hobbit safety video. Service great - lots of staff on hand to help with self check-in and bag drop. Onboard didn't have much to do with staff but seemed fine as usual. Used ANZ smartphone app for first time - very nice app and easy to use with helpful info. WEL-SYD on A320. Online check-in easy. Much easier boarding with smaller plane. Otherwise flight similar. Overall - not used to the larger plane with longer boarding and alighting time and I don't really like it so will try to avoid in future bookings. Seats also seemed closer together? Entertainment OK but could have done with a few more TV shows to choose from. Don't really like their new system of paying extra for the preferential seats but understand that there is an opportunity for them to make a bit of extra profit there. Glad to have finally got some frequent flyer points for this trans-Tasman flight as previously they have not given this with the cheaper seats.
3349,We flew MEL-LAX return in Business Premier on 3rd Dec returning 19th Jan. Although our 5th trip with Air NZ this was our first time travelling Business. I was impressed from the moment we were on the plane we were warmly greeted by the hostess and whilst getting settled were offered a pre-take off drink whilst the other passengers were boarding. At this time they also take an order for your pre-dinner drink to be served once cruising altitude is reached. Drinks and Food came out promptly and was of a high quality impressed that we were not presented with standard airline food. The lie flat beds were comfortable enough to get a few hours sleep on the long flight and definitely worth the extra money we spent. Entertainment system provided plenty of choice to suit a range of tastes making the trip going very fast. We had the same positive experience on our flight home and cannot praise Air NZ enough for such an enjoyable journey.
3350,Brisbane - Port Vila - Brisbane on new 737-800. Cabin Crew were attentive and helpful and meal was tasty. Seats were comfortable and entertainment was interesting. A good small airline.
3351,Melbourne-Port Vila-Sydney on B737-800. Seated in exit rows on both sectors and legroom is amazing. The cabin crew to Port Vila lacked smiles and warmth but crew on the return to Sydney were excellent. Meal and beverage services were poor to very good but overall a good little airline.
3352,SYD-VLI-SYD. Fantastic new aircraft great crew awesome food. Really impressed by Air Van. Plentiful alcohol including Tusker beer which is great! On time both ways. Entertainment is lacking as it is just a video about Vanuatu but audio ok. Really enjoyed this airline!
3353,Auckland to Vanuatu B737-800 return. Seats good overhead screens played for half of flight. Meal okay crew frumpy but hardly seen with Air Vanuatu. I was kicked in the back by a young child every minute of the flight until the last half hour and the two children were raucous and out of control the whole way.
3354,Outbound YYZ-DUB TS 430 13/04. Return DUB-YYZ TS 431 21/04. Competitive comfortable economy on transatlantic flights. Few complaints. Direct non stop flights to UK and Ireland is a big bonus on convenience and on time travel.
3355,TS 732 to Lisbon on April 19th. Cabin crew professional and courteous informative about rules kind to elderly passengers on board who didn't understand the language or had hearing problems. Food and beverages were served in a timely manner allowing passengers to get some sleep. Pilots were kind to introduce the team and give some flight information. Check in at airport was also smooth. I was seated in 23 A.
3356,LGW-YYZ. The outbound flight departed one hour late but arrived 5 minutes early so kudos to the pilots for making up the lost time (which was due to affairs outside of the airline's control). I was impressed with the quality of the food which both tasted good and sustained me well until I got to Canada and the wine was of good quality and I was pleasantly surprised by it as well as free non-alcoholic drinks throughout the flight! The in-flight entertainment system had a wide variety of options and I was kept entertained for much of the flight. The remainder of the time I was trying to sleep which given the leather seats and frugal legroom was rather difficult but surprisingly it was bearable for the 8 hour flight. The cost of the headphones didn't bother me as I brought my own with me and were compatible with the socket on the monitor. The flight crew were very charming and were happy to help with even the smallest of things (in my case filling in the landing card). The inbound flight back to London was much the same although one point I would make is that the overhead lighting made sleeping early on in the flight impossible as it was a bright orange for around 30 minutes after take-off before changing to a light blue and then to a dark purple. Would recommend bringing eye covers if you're intending to sleep on the red-eye flight. The flight crew were very polite in awaking passengers for breakfast which along with the dinner served 6 hours previously was small but tasty. I would definitely recommend flying with Air Transat as a very affordable way of flying from Europe to Canada and many of the costs for supplementary items can be easily offset - to avoid paying for a selected seat check in very early on so as to choose a good seat that hasn't already been chosen; to avoid the costs of headphones and blankets these can be brought with you onto the plane and the flight crew don't mind at all; the flight crew are also happy to move you to another seat if there is one free which is almost guaranteed on an Air Transat flight which are hardly ever fully booked.
3357,AKL-PPT return in economy in A340-300. About a few months after booking ATN sent me an e-mail with cancellation of the return flight due to a commercial decision. Because this is not a daily route I had to change both my outbound and inbound flight and either a domestic flight in New Zealand. No online check-in and advanced seat allocation possibility. Check-in both in Auckland and Papeete slow: few counters and long rows. Cabin crew friendly and well dressed with Tiare flowers in their hair. Decent food each seat has a PTV but no AVOD. Pretty cramped leg room. Once on the French Polynesian islands I was not able to change my return flight to Auckland with my standard Y fare which I don't understand. Overall the booking system and ground service are a bit outdated (still need to reconfirm flights) but in the aircraft you will have a small Tiare flower behind your ear and a smile on your face because this is an airline that flies to a very exotic location.
3358,LAX-PPT. The captain and crew thought people could govern themselves as there was no proper checking to see if everyone was belted in when the fasten seatbelt sign came on. Drinks were complimentary and meals decent. I was lucky enough to have a row of four seats to myself which I used to make a makeshift bed. My flight was a good one although the fare was steep - airline has actually been scrutinized recently for corrupt operating practices including sky- high fares so don't be surprised if your airfare is more than you expect.
3359,AKL-PPT-LAX. Horrible flight horrible service. Very slow check in and cramped seats. Service and food on flight fine. However arrived in LAX and they had lost my luggage. Waited 3 hours at the baggage carousel because attendents were disorganized kept walking away and not returning and they had no counter (or system it seems) to handle lost baggage. I was told unclaimed bags were just thrown on the carousel for the next flight coming in and that I should wait around to see if my bags arrived on another flight. Took 5 days to receive my bags. Air Tahiti Nui baggage line never answered my calls went to an answering machine and I left several messages. I only received a call 3 days later saying they had found my bags and they would arrive at my door the next day - which they did not. Wasted 2 days waiting at home for bags that didn't arrive. Finally received my luggage and called to claim my $65 compensation. I couldn't get this either and was told conflicting advice about having to fax someone or having to wait until I got back to Auckland. I was also told that my 2 hour layover was not enough time for the airport in Tahiti to transfer bags to a new plane. Since I had the same layover on the way back I called reservations to see what could be done so I didn't have the same problem on the way back to Auckland - flight change pay for an upgrade mark my bags as priority (I would have been happy with any advice they could give). During this conversation I was talked at instead of listened to treated rudely and the end result was that I was told there was nothing they could do and I shouldn't be so negative. I was told I shouldn't call them anymore. Apparently one phone call is considered harassment. All in all very bad flight and awful service. Even if this flight is a bit cheaper I will gladly pay more and fly Qantas or Air NZ in future. Would not recommend this airline at all.
3360,PPT-AKL. Attentive flight attendants courteous with genuine care. Hot brunch was not the best I've had on Air Tahiti Nui with meal overcooked/overheated. IFE equipment could be updated and it is now redundant compared to other airlines but choice offered makes up for it. The three languages (French/English/Tahitian) used for inflight communication are well enunciated but could be restricted to French and English only as too many announcements are quite distracting.
3361,Flew round trip from LAX to Rarotonga. The flight into Raro was fine except for the simply fair quality of food. The seating in economy was comfortable for a 9 hour overnight international flight. My primary complaint is about the terribly long lines for check-in at Raro for the Saturday night departure to LAX. The check-in counter is outside in a warm and humid climate and there are only 3 or 4 people working to serve scores of passengers and handle their baggage. We stood in line for over 1.5 hours even though we arrived 2 hours ahead of departure. There's obviously poor management for a process that occurs once per week and seemingly could easily be remedied by having a couple of more persons on staff for this check-in installation of some kiosks a faster computer system and some fans outside of the counter area. If you're infirm elderly or don't want your vacation capped off by a very unpleasant experience on your departure consider some other destination (or perhaps Virgin Australia).
3362,For me the self-check-in did not work out properly. In Wellington I was kindly assisted by someone from Air NZ . Also for my return flight home the self-check-in was aborted and had to go to the kiosk in Auckland. For my last trip from Auckland (NZ) to Dusseldorf (D) there I could only get a boarding pass for just the flight from Auckland to Sydney. For the other boarding passes I had to find my way in Sydney to get the next boarding passes. Very inconvenient and stressful especially when one needs an aisle seat because of physical handicap. Finally has it been handled well by the staff of Etihad.
3363,SFO-AKL round-trip. Seat pitch adequate for my 6'1' husband but footrest is useless does not come up high enough for anyone. Recline adequate for nap. Attentive staff. Meals well presented and fairly good. Entertainment system needs refurbishment remotes in both directions needed work and sound wasn't working properly in my seat on the return. I'm pretty sure that they used the same equipment on the outbound flight as I heard a person in my (future) seat making the same complaint about the sound on the outbound leg and wasn't surprised (but was disappointed) to discover that it had not been fixed a week later (or if fixed broke again already). Choice of entertainment good when working. Efficient ground staff. Notification of delay on the return was timely and adequate. Amenity kit and water bottle holder very useful but avoid front row of premium economy where it just becomes an annoyance because there is no storage.
3364,SYD-AKL-LAX and LAX-AKL-SYD. Consistently warm helpful and willing staff. Excellent product on the 777 with the thicker mattress on the bed (compared with Virgin Atlantic) and restaurant quality food and wine selection. Toilets are extremely small but there is a disabled one available in premium economy. Overall excellent interaction despite missed connection due to another carrier. Overall I would always choose to fly with AirNZ if possible. Unfortunately let down by their alliance with United who are the antithesis of everything AirNZ is. Would love them to have wider seats in Business on 767 as I choose to travel in business due to size and not to disturb or impede people next to me if I flew in economy. The 767 seat is my least favourite aspect of the experience.
3365,Brisbane to Vila via Santo return Santo to Brisbane. Friendly smiling flight attendants comfortable seats and meals and drinks provided. Santo to Vila on the same 737 we were given bottles of water and packets of banana crisps. However the flight from Vila to Santo was a very different story! We waited anxiously for the 737 to arrive to fly us to Santo but about 2 minutes before take-off there was nothing on the tarmac but a little De Havilland Twin Otter aircraft! And that proved to be our plane! No flight attendants no inflight snacks no toilets but that's what travel is all about!
3366,Brisbane-Portavila and then Portavila-Sydney economy class. Excellent service good recline of seat in economy nice inflight reading material. All in all a superb service.
3367,Auckland- Vila return. Out in Business and return in economy. Service on both sectors friendly and efficient - business class was in most respects a good experience with exception of the terrible seat pitch. Not a true business class pitch but sectors flown are mostly under 3 hours. Pitch more like about 35-38 inches felt like a premium economy seat pitch. Return food average economy fodder (who wants to eat a full dinner service at 2.00 am). Crew excellent. All in all Air Van are a very good little operator with newish 737-800. Would recommend despite the abysmal seat pitch in J class.
3368,Economy class from Brisbane to Santo return. The crew tried its best to make the journey most comfortable with decent food and a few rounds of drinks including wines and champagne. FA's smiling. The 737-800 seemed to be new. The entertainment system consisted of music programme and advertisements on Vanuatu which is okay for a 3-hour-flight.
3369,Syd-Vli-Syd on new tropical livery 738. Comfortable leather seats with good legroom. Service with good choice of beverages followed by a hot meal. Cabin crew in attendance and responded with a smile to all passenger requests.
3370,We flew to Punta Cana for our vacation March 20-27. Thank goodness I paid extra for exit aisle seats because otherwise we never would have managed. The seats are far too small for normal human beings. I appreciate I am tall (just under 6 feet) as is my daughter - and that is why I paid to have the extra leg room but we were completely wedged in as were many other folks around us. I will not fly this airline again for this reason. I must say the staff were outstanding and made the flight a pleasure. Service was excellent very professional and friendly. My only complaint is they are clearly trying to stuff folks in to up their profits. I would also add their inflight entertainment was very good - lots of options.
3371,Recent flight to Cuba from Ottawa and back. Flight left on time arrived in Cuba early. Departure from Cuba was early as well were back in Ottawa almost one hour early. That was the good part. The seats are small and cramped. We were on 737. I had no legroom at all had to stretch leg out into the isle just to get some room. Got a huge bruise on my outer thigh from trying to wedge into the seat very attractive for a beach vacation. (I am 6 ft tall and not overweight). No meals (which we knew) just a small snack bag of cookies and juice or pop. Kind of cheap. Staff seemed nice enough but with no meals to serve focus more on selling stuff. Overhead small screens for movies (which were good). Had my own headphones. Ok for the money but seats are very uncomfortable.
3372,Flew from Gatwick to Toronto March 2015. Paid the extra for option plus. No problems checking in staff smiley at 4 in the morning. The only complaint is that after being at the airport at 4 am checking in boarding etc took off a little late due to the catering company being late loading the plane. But to be handed a piece of banana bread for a breakfast was disgusting. Very hungry by the time that dinner was served being option plus I mistakenly thought that I may get a choice prior to the serving nope - by the time that the FA's got to row 28 all they had was a rice dish full of peppers so I went hungry. Thought that perhaps a dessert might suffice. Well a piece of fudge does not cut it. Not the FA's fault but they must have had something else on board - no offer whatsoever. I will be sure to pack my own food next time if they can not do any better than that cut out the food. The inflight entertainment was terrible they need to complete the refurbishment of their aircraft with ear buds in my own you could not hear the words all you could hear was a buzzing sound.
3373,Edmonton to Puerto Vallarta on Dec 27 2014 and back on Jan 10 2015. Excellent especially if you have kids! They have a special family line up which is so helpful and makes the airline stand out! Overall our trip to Mexico was great flights were on time the inflight entertainment was great and we had no problem paying for the food.
3374,With an unexpected weekend off in Harare and Victoria Falls beckoning Air Zim was the only option so we took a deep breath and booked. Outbound flight on 27-year-old B732 which left the stand with the precision of a Swiss train at 0800 and zero seconds. Served a reasonable snack and coffee and on-time arrival. Return flight on Sunday was on a leased E145 fully booked with departure from the stand 5 minutes early and again nice snack and drink en route. The crew was 75% SAA. Overall could have no complaints at all.
3375,Living and working in South Africa I fly home to Zimbabwe fairly often and try to be patriotic and use the national airline. I have only been delayed once in the past year. Food is good and service also of acceptable standards. Ggetting through to the Joburg offices is another story altogether - overall I think Air ZIm are doing the best they can with the resources at their disposal.
3376,AKL-PPT. A very enjoyable flight - check in quick and pleasant crew friendly and professional. Food good and nice wine choices. Old style seats really let them down but otherwise nothing to fault
3377,I have flown Air Tahiti Nui several times. I always fly First Class. The level of service on the 2 flights I took on this trip has diminished. The amenity kits are not the same. On the flight LAX to PPT I was given an appetizer that was a joke. A small piece of shrimp with some sauce and 2 pieces of cheese. This is not First Class Service I was used to with Air Tahiti Nui previously. The boarding process is nerve racking. I resent having to go boxed in the buses that transport you to the aircraft. They box you in like sardines. I pay nearly $5000.00 for a one way flight to PPT and get the same boarding treatment was a coach paying passenger.
3378,AKL-PPT-AKL. Did MEL-AKL earlier in the day with Emirates on a seperate booking. Bags checked in through to PPT at MEL did make it with us so no complaints there. Looking at the plane's fuselage the cabin decor and the Tahitian music playing made you feel you are going on a vacation. Inflight crew attentive and friendly especially on the way back. Meals were good. Only sore point was the IFE. It was not AVOD and very limited choices. Had the IFE been better would have scored this flight at 9 or 10.
3379,The overnight flight Papeete to LA was cancelled without notice. We were booked on the flight 12 hours later which meant we could not make any connecting flights that day to JFK as we arrived too late. We were given an hotel room for the night before the flight but had to fend for ourselves in LA for the enforced overnight stop. The reason for the cancellation was not made clear but I would suspect it was none other than not enough passengers as cancellations seems to happen frequently. The same flight the previous evening had also been cancelled. At no time did anyone offer an apology. I would not recommend this airline as they are unreliable.
3380,LAX-PPT-AKL-LAX Economy return. The flight from LAX to PPT was cancelled. I was notified about two weeks before the flight was supposed to leave. I was a bit peeved as the flight from LAX was a connecting flight and the cancellation meant that I had to overnight in LA and take the next flight the following morning. I explained my situation to Air Tahiti Nui and they put me up in a hotel (Four Points by Sheraton)and gave me dinner and breakfast vouchers! The flights were all on time plane modern plenty of room for economy. I'm 5'11 and was comfortable for the entire trip. The inflight entertainment is not as modern as it could be its not on demand but the movie selection is good and there is a nice selection of recent releases. One note of caution try to avoid any stopovers in Tahiti that will be longer than two hours - the airport is old and boring and there is nothing to do while you wait not even a TV to watch. The food was superb for economy and inflight service by the attendants was friendly polite and professional. Topping all of this off is the fact they were $700-$1000USD cheaper than ANZ Qantas or United.
3381,"Auckland to Nadi Fiji on 14/02/2014 (NZ752) and back on 19/02/2014 (NZ753) and on both flights I was not given the food of my choice. On the trip to Nadi they had chicken or salmon but by the time they got to our row (which was only on row 18) they had run out of the chicken. The terrible thing about it was how the flight attendant approached the situation. She said ""we've ran out of the chicken and only have salmon will you be happy with that."". No apologies or any kind word to say to a passenger who paid extra for the food! On the return trip same scenario. Except they had a choice of chicken or lamb and they ran out of chicken. Considering we were only in row 15 (and there were so many more rows behind us) to run out of the more popular choice that early on is just not right. I would've been okay with it but the flight attendant gave that same annoying line again ""will you be happy with that?"". The problem is I do not eat lamb. After I said to the attendant I don't eat lamb she said there was a vegetarian meal that no one has claimed will I be happy with that? again that line! I didn't think I had a choice so yes I will have it but I cannot say I am happy with it."
3382,MEL-AKL-SFO return in J class on NZ's very old 747s. Being a TG Platinum member I don't often travel on other carriers but have no real choice when it comes to the US. Have to say that flying NZ is a predominantly pleasant experience with real food served restaurant style a fantastic lie flat bed (even in the old planes) and great service from experienced cabin crew. So in the air great but on the ground they leave a lot to be desired. The self serve check in at MEL is a joke. It is not a premium service and you need to manually check that your baggage is tagged priority. AKL boarding is a schmozzle with very small gates and loads of passengers. Forget about trying to access the premium boarding gates! So all in all great on board but lousy on ground.
3383,Flew with my business partner AKL-LAX-AKL in Premium Economy on 777-300. Boarding was stress free both sides as we were Premium Economy plus Star Alliance Gold and Koru members so either way we were first on the plane. The flight attendants were available and were there to help right from the start with overhead locker storage etc. Main meals were delivered shortly after take off both ends and the quality of the meals were very similar if not the same to what I've had in business class with each course brought out separately. Quality of the alcohol was good plus it was nice to have a good mug of tea coffee and after dinner mints afterwards. Amenity Packs were the same as in business class. The seat is multi adjustable and obviously nowhere near lie flat but after some adjustment got a nice sleeping position. The seat and footwells accommodated my 6 foot 2 inch frame my only criticism was the footwell that narrows wouldn't accommodate my size 12?™s so take your shoes off and rest your feet on the bean bag supplied. The crew both ways were excellent. The quality of service was excellent. The seats being pod design mean your personal space is not encroached on I am disappointed to hear that Premium Economy seating on their Dreamliner or the 777-200 upgrades will not be using this type of seating.
3384,SYD-VLI-SYD in business class. I agree with others comments on the service and friendliness of the airline but Air Vanuatu must do something to improve their business class seats - although they are wide enough the pitch is dismal and does not even allow a footrest. I would urge Air Vanuatu to at least upgrade to Air Pacific standards ie a 50 inch pitch and seats with a proper footrest. Otherwise I can only commend the airline.
3385,4 flights with Air Vanuatu Sydney - Vila return in the last 6 months. Once the seat belt sign goes off they start their cabin service within 60 seconds not hiding behind a curtain for 30 minutes. Also when you hit the call button the longest time it has taken to get service was less than a minute.
3386,Took flight TS205 from San Jose to Montreal at 17.15 on Feb 27 2015. First issue was that they boarded plane from both ends at same time without regard to seat location. I was in the second to last row and was boarding from the front. Took 15 minutes to find our way to back of plane. Main problem was that someone forgot to order the right amount of food. This was a supper flight and we did not arrive till midnight. I estimate that half the passengers were given only a bag of peanuts for supper. From talking with the flight attendant seems this situation was not all that unusual. The worse part is that no one informed the passengers before boarding. We would have had plenty of time to buy some food before boarding. This airline is very inconsiderate of their passengers.
3387,Recently returned from Costa Rica flight was on time there and back very old plane uncomfortable small seats only one movie to watch. Also flight was out of Montreal although most people are French speaking on it not all of us are. One stewardess could not or would not speak English and another passenger had to tell me what she wanted after I told her I didn't understand French. Very rude!
3388,"My husband and I took our first AT trip Vancouver - Puerto Vallerta last week. We were pleasantly surprised at the new Airbus lovely staff and service. Forget food expectations on such a reasonably priced flight. We did experience what we call charter ""hell"" to find our return flight to Vancouver cancelled for a day due to mechanical issue. We were fabulously managed: arrived at airport to hear that news at 1 pm - sent in private taxi to the newly renovated all inclusive Hyatt Ziva. Picked up 6 am next day for smooth flight back to Vancouver. In addition handed $150 credit voucher on boarding towards next flight anytime in the next 18 month. I would definitely travel AT again based on this trip."
3389,Harare-London-Harare. Originally booked flight on Friday which was cancelled. Flights were punctual and staff friendly. Old planes and no entertainment. But being the only direct flight to Europe from Harare and with prices less then half of any other airline still OK for anybody wanting a cheap flight to London as long as one has the flexibility to cope with changes of schedule.
3390,I was on my flight back from London. There is never any inflight entertainment on your long haul journeys and yet they is a projector onboard - very disappointing. One of the flight attendants back chats when I ask for a refreshment because I could not sleep - he tells me sir do you know it is four in the morning! It is not good to arrive at the airport and get told that the aircraft has to stop over in Lusaka to refuel!.
3391,"AKL-LAX-AKL (via PPT) First Class. The service onboard is outstanding and pretty difficult to fault. The crew could not have been more professional or pleasant. Food AKL-PPT and PPT-LAX would have been at home in 5 star restaurant (less good on the return but still acceptable). Seats although first generation lie flat were comfortable and all features worked. There is no screen between passengers but I did not feel an invasion of personal space. Boarding on all legs was efficient and every leg left early . The negatives? Ground crew at all three airports. At the initial check in Auckland I did not get the aisle seat I had requested and had been confirmed with the airline 7 months earlier - and had to kick up quite a fuss - miraculously one opened up. The same thing happened PPT-LAX. On arrival at LAX no bags. They were off-loaded at PPT and could not be traced. They did turn up on the next flight: that isn't good enough on economy but it is completely unacceptable in First. The response of the LAX agents could not havee dismissive. Arriving back in Auckland bags (which had first and priority labels) were the last to appear (perhaps I should be grateful that they appeared at all!). So inflight this is a rival to any airline and competitively priced on the Transpacific route; it certainly would have been a ""10"". If only they could get their act together with ground crew."
3392,Flew from Melbourne Flight 728 January 24th. Asked for works told not available woman next to me got meal. Option should be available if asked for. Films were awful not worth the $10 asked. Water was undrinkable. Prices to fly from Hamilton to Wellington are extortionate just because they have a monopoly.
3393,I fly Air NZ a lot and as always was very happy with the service I received. 1/1/14 AKL-PVG NZ289. The flight was on time check in was smooth and the staff were very friendly as usual. The seat was comfortable and the bed gave me a great sleep on my overnight flight. Flying Air NZ in any class is very nice but they do Business Premier very well!
3394,Brisbane to Auckland to San Francisco 4/12/13 returning 6/12/14 Business Class. Brilliant service on this airline. Love the way they employ mature flight attendants who are so friendly courteous and helpful. Seat folding to flat bed for transpacific flight was wonderfully comfortable. Food was (mostly) delicious with some exceptions.
3395,I have flown Air Transat from Toronto to London almost every year and sometimes twice a year. I am a senior now and always buy option plus. Air Transat has always been very good to me. They are on time courteous and respectful. They are almost always on time and if not there is a very good reason. No it is not a luxury airline but it gets one from A to B safely and at reasonable cost. If you don't like the food take your own as I do. It is not necessary to have a full meal when you are only in the air for a few hours. Safety should always be your number 1 priority.
3396,Just got back from Mayan Riviera on Air Transat flight. The flight was fabulous comfortable seats. Staff were friendly and helpful. Entertainment screen in the seat backs allowing you to choose a fairly recent movie from 20 or so selections. Planes were relatively new or redone. The only complaint I have is my daughter is celiac and there were no meals on the menu identified as gluten free. We upgraded to options plus but she was not able to eat. The only thing remotely close to GF is a fruit tray - however being celiac this can not be trusted. Could have been produced on the same cutting board using the same knife they use for gluten products.
3397,"I travelled alone to NZ via LA on 17th December returning on 8th January both ways as economy passenger. On the outward flight I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a better seat by the LHR lady who checked me in and was happy with everything. Don't expect to be super comfy in economy but this 'preferred seat' was great. On the return flight on checking in at Christchurch for the hop to Auckland (NZ 546 7/1/14 boarding 19.15) I asked the check in attendant if there was any chance of a better seat (mine was 55F one seat in from the aisle in the central row where I had not enough room to pick up something I had dropped on the floor). I was told in no uncertain terms that ""I was lucky to have a seat as this flight is overbooked""! I was pretty annoyed. As I had 24hrs flying ahead of me I decided to remain calm and not react. Fortunately at LA (what a dive that is) I asked tentatively if there was any chance of a change of seat and the attendant was able to offer me a window seat 49A which was so much more comfortable I had room to move for which I was most grateful. Apart from the lady at Christchurch I have nothing but praise for the staff both ground and air."
3398,My trip was WLG-ACK-LAX/SFO return. Great work. First time flying on air New Zealand despite living in the country for over 15 years. Excellent catering and entertainment. Would use again.
3399,"PER-AKL NZ 0176. Good comfortable seat. Female staff unfriendly unhelpful abrupt and unnecessarily rude to some passengers. Seemed they were plain irritated at being ""at work."" that day. Sat at back so had to accept what was left on the trolley. Food not very good either. Beverages were also slow in being supplied throughout the trip. Tv plus remote did not function properly so did not watch any entertainment. Co-sharing SAA did not do it for me either on the first leg of my trip from SA. Sat on tarmac for an hour before take-off due to a ""technical"" problem. Will definitely not fly Air NZ again."
3400,Recently I boarded a flight on Air Transat travelling from Toronto to Punta Cana Dominican Republic. My recent experience seems to be in sync with most of the posts regarding service provided with this carrier delays in departure are to be expected. Delays are not a deal breaker for me as I embrace safety first. However simple customer service is what I expect from an airline carrier in the wake of extensive cutbacks to this industry. My complaint really is very simple. I requested a window seat well in advance to the closing of seat bookings. As I booked my seat with the airline representative at the airport I was guaranteed a window seat I had even reviewed with the agent that this was correct (I always double check my reservations bookings). Upon boarding the flight I found that my seat was not a window seat and that it was the last row of seats in the centre of the plane. It has been two weeks since my flight. I still don't understand why they would not tell me the truth. I watched the representative check the seat bookings on the computers like I have done countless times before. Overall after having travelled with almost all the airlines in the world to every continent in the world Air Transat falls well below customer service. I am by no means a person whom expects luxury I am happy to settle for the basics point A to B. I will never board another Air Transat flight.
3401,We travelled Calgary to Puerto Vallarta in Feb 2015 and like others on this site were less than impressed. We expected the small seats and 'pay for any extra's' approach but thought it excessive when they wanted $9 for a blanket. After flying for 45 minutes shivering I put on my outer coat and asked if it would be warming up soon. Another 20 minutes and I asked for a blanket where the $9 charge was offered. Nice business model. When we arrived in PV I was pleased to see that there was a jetway since my mobility is poor but Air Transat doesn't use it according to the stewardess because it is an extra cost. So down the long stairs onto the pavement we all went. I only decided to comment when the online check-in offered out of Calgary did not work for PV. Scoured the website to see if it was one of those excluded with no specific comment. I see Punta Cana and other Mexican sites so it cannot be the in country affluence. What the heck AT? Can't the jet fuel savings be put into some minor customer sat focus?
3402,SYD-AKL-NAD-AKL in Jan 2014. All flights on 777-300 with herring pattern arranged ?œspace-seats??in business (and eco+?). All flights on time. Aircraft clean staff neat and all flights on time. Food good. Lounges very good in all three airports visited. Only the lounge staff could improve. On board the planes a similar attitude: FAs appear to be very local somehow managing to disrespect passengers by being by far too familiar and too self- confident doing too much talking for nothing and on the verge of being intrusive. All FAs (except a single one) were clearly ageing over the hill and that shows. Order details were forgotten during the lengthy chat sessions which at times were embarrassing or painful. On the outbound I had 13 hours transit in AKL and no hotel was provided as this was a regular schedule time gap! They also managed not to reload my bag to NAD and it remained in AKL. Arrived 28 hours later to Suva upon filling forms and lots of confusion and phone calls.
3403,Traveled HK-Auckland on 10 Jan 2014. Aircraft was a B777-200. The interior was quite old. Food choices were limited in quantity and since I was sitting at second to last row (64) twice both dinner and breakfast I was left with whatever available and none of them suited me. Air NZ does not provide toothbrush and toothpaste which are available on Cathay Pacific and Singapore long haul flight. In terms of in-flight entertainment movies were out dated. My audio socket was dead on the right output. Air NZ stewards seem to be over casual. The most irritating thing was Air NZ allowed only a single piece check-in baggage where Cathay Pacific and Singapore allow two.
3404,My wife and I are sitting at the airport while I'm writing this. We're on our way to Cancun from Toronto on an Air Transat flight #520 which was supposed to depart at 8.25am. They boarded most of us just to tell us that the plane needs repairs and we have to leave the plane. In about half hour we're told that the plane will be repaired and new departure will be at 1.50pm. About 11am we find out that the plane is fixed and will be at the gate in few minutes. Everyone was very happy but the happiness was vanquished when we found out that the crew was gone. They showed up at 12.30. It's 12.55 right now and we're still here. I appreciate them fixing the plane very much but the fact that the we have been sitting here for another hour watching the fixed plane outside the window without knowing how much longer it will take gets on my nerves. Never again.
3405,"Our yearly vacation to Cuba was a huge disappointment flying with Air Transat flight 121. We left Edmonton January 12 2015 returned January 19 2015. The flight left on time only to be told we now had to de-ice. I understand de-icing but couldn't this be done before 346 passengers are on board. Then the stop in Calgary to pick up more passengers was of course late leaving. And of course we had to fuel up in Calgary so more time on the ground. I would of thought fuelling up would be part of the plane being ready for the long journey not part of the passengers holidays. We Left Edmonton at 6.30 am there was not so much as a glass of water offered until 11.30 am. As other reviews have stated it was all about the sale cart and duty free items for sale. I am 5'6"" tall average size the seat size was for a child as my legs hung so far over the length of the chair and so uncomfortable I had a sore back on arrival. The plane arrived late into Cuba so arriving late at our resort at 7.15 pm 1 of day short of our 7 day holiday. The return flight left late and after arriving in Edmonton 1 of our luggage didn't arrive. Thanks to WestJet we had our luggage returned 3 days later. We had paid $140 extra for seat selection but the service was no service. I would gladly pack a bagged lunch but remember no food or drinks when entering security. The small bag of cookies was a joke. The staff appeared to be unhappy and the last thing they wanted to do was deal with passengers. Think twice before flying Air Transat."
3406,Flight from Nadi Fiji back to Auckland on 767-300 on Nov 2013. Plane very old and dirty. Awful smell from the rest room the whole flight. Exit seat - absolutely not worth the money. Food quality and service below average. The price for the flight ticket was very expensive. No air miles for those flights in Miles and More programme.
3407,"Sydney - Auckland - Queenstown return. Tran Tasman was okay. I know cabin crew seem to have a tough job but at the end of flight was bombarded by crew asking for performance reviews to the cabin manager. Got a tad much after a while. Food pretty poor Auckland - Queenstown return. A small cookie and a tea for a 1 hr 45 min flight. Also in close proximity to screaming toddlers - the cabin crew gave out ear plugs but hey what can you do. Return trip in Premier sort of lacked the ""refinement"" of say Qantas or Cathay. Sort of too relaxed and friendly. Wouldn't go Business again for that short distance again."
3408,Flew YEG to PV Jan 10-17. For a 5 hr flight inflight service atrocious. Terrible $7.50 sandwiches would be over priced if they were free! Coffee was tepid and we were never asked offered a refill. The little cakes could not be classified as food (all preservatives). How difficult can it be to offer edible food and decent beverages for long flights? The flight crew both ways didn't seem to want to be there. It is basically a flying tour bus.The inflight movie offerings are poor. When you pay an additional $60 for your seats ($25 going $35 return) in addition to the fare you expect something.
3409,Premium economy LAX to Auckland. The Spaceseat looks impressive but was disappointed to find it quite grubby wet wipes to the rescue sealed travel blanket covered in food bits quickly replaced by staff. I loved the seat quite comfortable taller traveling companion found it very restrictive to finding a comfortable sleeping position. Cabin full but quiet nice staff all helpful. Food was very disappointing fish was just warm not heated properly salad had died many days ago. Dessert served before dinner economy style food with a bit of extra garnish. No tea or coffee after dinner wine service was just a drinks trolley as per economy. Aside from the food all in all more pleasant than economy but IMO lacked the finesse and polish many other premium services offer.
3410,Trans Tasman A320. Economy class. In many ways ANZ are a great airline. But the seating on these aircraft's are the tightest I have encountered. I am an average build male and had to squeeze myself into my seat. If the passenger in front decides to recline their seat be prepared to wear your meal. I have travelled overseas on several 'budget' airlines and have had more room. This configuration is fine for a 40 minute AKL-WLG flight but not for a 4 hour flight with meals.
3411,Disappointed with Air Transat - Toronto to Punta Cana. The aisle is very narrow and the seats recline so far back that the table is too close for comfort. The Bistro menu is limited and a better system should be provided for faster service. It takes a long time for the flight attendant to come by to clear the trays. At the departure gate passengers are put on a bus without any explanation and taken to the plane for boarding.
3412,Travelled business premier class from AKL to Honolulu. Although in row 2 were ignored until last for our meal service. Both times missed out on our choices can easily get over that but the order in which cabin crew served people was a mess made no sense and took forever to complete. Half the time crew didn't know who had served who and on a few occasions drink orders were forgotten and on asking another crew member to follow up they continued to leave it to the original crew member who had long forgotten. The order of service was not front to back back to front or side to side it was completely random. The rest of row 2 had been served even though we frantically tried to get the crews attention. Paid full fare tickets. Felt completely left out and almost felt like the crew were prejudice against us even though they were lovely chatting to us. Very strange and wouldn't put my money back there to risk being mistreated again.
3413,"NRT-CHC on 777-200 in premium economy. I knew the product would be inferior to the 777-300 and 747 ones but still it is a relief to have much more legroom and better catering. Check in at NRT was a breeze and the ANA lounge (as I have Air NZ Elite/Star Alliance Gold status) is pleasant quiet and comfortable with an adequate range of snacks and drinks. Boarding was a bit chaotic as the gate area has people scattered standing around making it difficult to get to priority boarding easily. Once on board service was efficient and helpful my Elite status was recognised by getting first requests for all meals for myself and my partner. Dinner was a reasonable fish dish and breakfast was poached eggs which were heated sufficiently and not too much. Wine drinks services always very good. Seats are tired and need replacing. 3-3-3 configuration for premium economy isn't good value for money especially since you lose an inch of seat width as the tray tables fold into the fixed armrests. The seats are quite hard and the leg rest useless for anyone my height or above (I'm 5'10""). Inflight entertainment system had an adequate selection but mine was buggy and needed rebooting. Luggage arrived quickly at Christchurch. Overall reasonable experience as the fare premium over economy was only about 22% but it wouldn't justify full fare."
3414,Flight was delayed due to a mechanical error - perfectly fine with me. The crew were polite and tried to keep us updated while we were in New Zealand. The next flight to Gold Coast was shortly afterwards but due to whatever reasons no one from our flight was able to board this plane even though there were ten seats left. I feel apologetic for those with little ones to look after. We ended up flying on the next flight to Brisbane and expected to be able to coach straight to Coolangatta which the crew had promised. Unfortunately we had to wait an hour for our coach to arrive and by then everyone was shattered. People from our flight had arrived as early as 5am and we were expected to arrive at 9.30am Queensland time. We arrived back around 8pm. Wouldn't fly Air New Zealand again. I wasn't impressed.
3415,"I flew to Kuala Lumpur and back and hated both flights. I'm 6 foot tall, and I usually go in a window seat and I am fine. I was on the aisle seat for both flights and found my legs crammed in. My seat wouldn't recline and found it impossible to find a comfortable position. The plane was too cold, I shivered on the plane and can only be grateful I wasn't allocated a middle or window seat. If you are over 6 feet, 183cm tall, don't expect a pleasant experience. Only good thing was the staff were absolutely fine."
3416,Very disappointed with the Air Transat reps at Grand Paradise Playa Dorado in Puerto Plata. Our flight TS 1787 was to leave at 4.10 from Puerto Plata. However flight 1786 on Dec 11/14 was delayed until 1.54 pm changing our departure time to 7 pm. I understand the delay in Toronto but I am extremely upset that we sat inside the airport for almost 6 hours. I believe the reps should have been aware that the flight was delayed and should have offered the guests to stay at the resort for those 3 hours versus locked in an airport with no smoking area no communication of the length of delay so we could have waited to go through customs and enjoyed the afternoon sun. Suggest better communication!
3417,Toronto to Manchester November 2014 I travel this route once a year there is only Air Transat who do this direct flight so I really have no other choice. These days you have to buy a blanket for $9 (credit card payment only) no bottle water and seat pitch seems limited. They do give you water if you ask but good luck getting their attention I could live without the blanket if they didn't turn the air conditioning down. Lunch was okay I dont expect a gourmet meal so it was as expected but the breakfast was atrocious in the cardboard box was an empty coffee cup an orange juice and a strawberry yoghurt. Air Transat has always been a budget airline and I don't expect much but as bad as the food and service has always been its actually getting worse. On a positive note flight was on time and the plane was clean but give me some competition and I'll be there.
3418,After 17 years of not flying with Air NZ we decided to try again and flew Auckland - Shanghai NZ 289 6th December. The flight was fine. A 4 hour delay before we left Auckland I felt this could have been dealt with a lot more efficiently at Shanghai airport where I had a connecting flight that had just left. First I was told I was to go via Amsterdam to my destination in Zurich then have the flight changed back to my original connecting flight with no directions to the transit desk. Great I thought when the flight was changed back to the original however the very poor English speaker at the transit desk proceeded to give me the wrong time as a consequence I missed my connecting flight. I was finally put on a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt and arrived in Zurich 40 hours after I left home. Added to this my husband and daughter who have travelled separately have had the same delay from Auckland airport. I realize this is a Shanghai airport problem however from what I have since read from other reviewers it is not a one off occurrence. We have the prospect of this all occurring again when we fly back on 11th January 2014. We will go back to flying with either Singapore or Thai.
3419,"We were part of the 375 passengers upended by a flawed NZ7 flight from SFO to Auckland on Dec 12th. Scheduled time of departure 7.45pm PDT cancelled due to ""refuelling issue"" at 11.30pm. All of us were placed into surrounding hotels. Fax at front desk said to report to gate at 11.30am and we would then depart at 1pm and that our flight was now modified to go from SFO to Honolulu then to Nadi Fiji and finally Auckland. We didn't leave at 1 were delayed a few more hours due to ""catering loading"". Catering was messed up on the flight breakfast served at dinner timtams for breakfast and an attendant crew that was obviously on edge and running out of hours. To say the least any and all connecting flights were also impacted. My flight should have taken 12 hpurs this route took 19. I'm considering alternatives for next time."
3420,"MEL-AKL-YVR. The new e-kiosk check in at Melbourne may be cheaper for Air NZ to operate than using human beings but it doesn't help passengers. I had only one bag (I'm allowed up to 3 in Business Class) which was 200g over the 23kg limit. Computer Says No. After moving a couple of items into my hand luggage (which isn't weighed) and some help from a harassed Air NZ human (who secretly admitted that she hates the new check-in system too) my bag was whisked away. An uneventful flight to Auckland then on to Vancouver on an elderly and rather tatty 777-200 followed. Inflight entertainment is adequate but the movie selection is poor with no major new releases available. Service was friendly and unintrusive and the food was OK. I don't expect fine dining on a plane. I have to make this trip fairly frequently and this airline/route is by far the best option but over time I have noticed that Air NZs cost cutting is becoming more obvious and the premium I pay for the Business Class ""experience"" isn't as worthwhile as it once was."
3421,Air Asia India: Traveled from Delhi to Bangalore on May 23rd. One of the worst experiences I have had. We boarded the flight which was scheduled to depart at 5.25 pm but due to some technical reasons they returned from the runway and had to change the plane at the last moment. As a result the flight got delayed by almost 3 hours. Next surprise was that they did not offer complementary food considering everybody was just sitting in the plane for 3 hours. When some of us asked the reply was that they are not carrying sufficient food for everyone. The crew was inexperienced. They had no idea about how to handle the situation. I think Air Asia should focus on the quality of services before expanding their network.
3422,On the return flight from Toronto to London on 17 October the seating arrangement changed about halfway down the plane from two seats in a row to three seats in a row. The seat was so uncomfortable with not much room to manoeuvre the couple in the next two seats to mine complained too especially as the woman was pregnant. I complained to the stewardess and took a couple of photos to remember the experience. She was sympathetic to my views and agreed that the three in a row seats appeared smaller with less space to stretch out your feet below. In the end it appears that most no frills airlines want to make enough money to make a profit at the expense of the comfort of passengers.
3423,TRZ-KUL-DPS-JOG and CGK-KUL-MAA. Travelled in the month of November 2014. Booked the tickets few months in advance good deal. All are A320 aircraft's neat and clean. Both ground staff and crew are good in service. Departed / Landed on time. Hope to travel again. Strongly recommend others for travelling in Air Asia.
3424,Flew recently from Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was delayed 2 hours. Notification when I was already on my way to the airport. Also cheap is something else with all the add ons you end up paying double to the advertised price. Had better experiences with Lionair / Tigerair for flights in Asia. No space in the aircraft and a small water costs 3$.
3425,My flight was from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur on 30 March 2015 at 11.55am. At about 10.30am we were told the flight would leave 2.5 hours late. (We didn't board until after 3pm). Many of us would miss connecting flights I was told that I would be informed about my new connection in Kuala Lumpur. We arrived just after 9pm we handed our boarding passes and were told to wait. After an hour we were given boarding passes for our next flights and were told we had to collect our baggage to go to a hotel. We waited for an hour with our luggage then went through immigration and customs and left the airport to wait for a bus to our hotel. After midnight some of us started to realise that the promised hotel rooms were non-existent and went inside to be in the air conditioning. (We hadn't had food or water served for about five hours by this time.) One staff member yelled at people who were reluctant to leave again to wait for the hotel bus and security were called when one passenger started to complain loudly. A group of passengers were taken to a hotel and returned to our group outside the airport after an hour because they couldn't get them rooms. AirAsia staff then left us. I for example waited 12 hours outside the airport with all my luggage; I had no Malaysian currency to buy food because I was only in transit. No one offered me a food or drink voucher and not one AirAsia staff member apologised. Apparently this level of service is acceptable. I would never book with them again as it's a false economy: you might save a few dollars upfront but if something goes wrong AirAsia takes no corporate responsibility and you are on your own.
3426,"You get what you paid for. Yes I agree that the service is not what the ""over-something"" age-group expects. But the reason we travel with them is that Air transat flights are cheap. Let's face it I would not be travelling to see loved ones on a regular basis if we did not get these budget flight prices. Yes I agree the service falls apart from there. I agree the food is abysmal. So message to Air Transat is - major on your great flight prices forget the food (don't even offer it within the price - please do not insult us with an inferior product). Instead recommend to passengers that they take their own food (I did on my return journey and I was really glad) or offer a paid-for on-board food service of quality which passengers could purchase (""quality"" being the operative here). That way you make money on the food and you can also cut back on the cost of Cabin Service (including personnel because there would be no need for so many staff). Then apply these savings to even better flight prices!"
3427,My wife and I returned from our first cruise. We selected Air Transat and Marlin travel as we have booked through them before. We left Oct 11 and returned Oct 18 from YYZ to FLL as bad luck would have it the same plane reg number 802 both ways. I anticipated that since AT had just received the 737-800 fleet they would be in good shape. Never assume. I was seated in 3a and seat 2a was missing the cover plate for the left arm rest exposing the wires and mechanical system. This area was also dirty. Above 2h there was a large piece of trim which was loose between the bins and the wall. Watching the attendants they struggled to operate the cabin lights and overhead entertainment machine. Now the worst. The forward toilet seat was broken in half left side which I reported to the attendants. On the way home the seat was taped together with what appeared to be white medical tape. The entertainment system movie was not working and both trim pieces in the same shape. No seat belt trays up or seat back up inspection from the attendants either taking off or landing. Terrible plane and disappointment. I am not a perfectionist but do appreciate a clean well maintained plane. Fly another carrier.
3428,My 18 year old son has just arrived in Vancouver after flying MEK-AKL-YVR. He is travelling to a skiing camp so had excess and over sized baggage which we had accounted for. Check-in at the at the airport is an e-kiosk with no option to use a counter. This is fine if flying is straight forward and you have one bag. I was most unimpressed and sought assistance from ground staff who were helpful. I noticed older passengers who were struggling and thought about families with young children bags prams and car seats and wonder how one person is to manage. The plane was old and the seat uncomfortable and he was served the identical meal on the Auckland and Vancouver legs. Luckily it was good however being hungry he asked for a second meal and was told he couldn't have one - this is company policy. So he went hungry for a 12 hr flight. This is not acceptable and we will not be flying Air NZ again.
3429,"I have flown many flights with Air Asia and Air AsiaX over the past few years. I generally found them to be a value airline but my opinion is changing. I flew from HoChiMinhCity to Kuala Lumpur return. As with most discount airlines the ""all in price"" listed in the booking is hard to find. First of all you have to wade through the various ad-ons for baggage insurance etc deducting them as you go or you end up with an inflated fare. But to my surprise as I hadn't experienced this gouge before the booking imposed a $12 fee for using my credit card. As well the onboard duty free sales do not take credit cards only Malaysian currency and US dollars despite stating that all major currencies were accepted. My seat-mate on the inbound flight had to convince staff to accept Euros. All in all after all costs were added up the flight was only marginally cheaper than Vietnam Airlines and far less hassle with a full service carrier. Air Asia advertises low-cost but their fares have risen dramatically in the past few years. I don't think the average customer wants to have to spend time and energy having to find the ""all in price"" deducting the various ad-ons only to be stung at the end with the credit card charge. By then you are so fed up with the search for the initial fare that you just agree to pay the ""fine"" for using your credit card. In my caes it amounted to a surcharge of about 15%. The credit card companies charge their customers 3%. Flying discount airlines can be the only reasonable cost way to fly to some destinations. But always compare ""all in"" is an advertising pitch leaving you to find it."
3430,In the past 2 years I have travelled with Air Transat 26 times. In the early days I would buy an upgrade to club at the check in and at Â£100 pounds or so it was well worth the better seat comfort which was my main concern. The food and beverage is way above the economy standard. These days I only book economy as the rate for club is much more (Â£300) plus and you are not immune from the frequent screaming brat brigade behind the curtain. Now I take pot luck and get my seat allocated at the check in. I don't think I have ever been on a flight that has left on time - always 30 mins plus late as a minimum and on one occasion we left over 2 hours late! No apology coming from the crew and some missed the ongoing connections. To be fair the staff have been overall good given the standard of some of the passengers expectations. So why do I keep using Air Transat? Simple they are the cheapest and Gatwick is much better than getting round to hideous Heathrow. My advice for what it worth is if you can manage 7 hours get fed and watered before you go. Expect screaming kids and if you are lucky you will be far enough away not to worry about and in any case get some noise cancelling headphones they help a bit! Check out the cost of club over econ and to be honest it just don't add up. Personally I wish they would give decent seats no food and water/drinks available at a cost and I would gladly pay an extra amount for that. Like the man says you get what you pay for I guess?
3431,I paid an extra Â£59 each way to Toronto for extra leg room. It certainly was not worth the extra money for the seats I had the food wasn't worth eating I would not travel on Air Transat again. I feel I wasted the extra money on the extra leg room seats.
3432,SYD-AKL-YVR-AKL-SYD return agree with majority of comments re checked in baggage allowance + cabin bag allowance (7kg) as last time I flew to North America checked in baggage allowance was 2x 23kg bags. Clean Cabin friendly staff decent inflight catering + AVOD options.
3433,Fly drive Mukdahan - KOP - DMK. Poor service at check in. Bag overweight so had to pay extra. No problem. Went to service desk to pay. Lady started to serve my wife and then dealt with someone at the next window already being served and ignored us. Flight cramped compared to Nok Air. Drive was fine and on time from Mukdahan. Plane to DMK a little late.
3434,Flew to Vancouver Flight TS777. 6 October 2014. Awful hot flight. AC not working for a few flights. Food was horrible especially the inedible 'pizza'. Seats were very uncomfortable. Tickets were around Â£1200 for 2 so not that cheap to merit extremely hot long haul trip with broken AC and awful food and rigid seats.
3435,Flew from Toronto to Dublin and was very disappointed. The flight was overnight and for 5 of the 6 hour flight the fluorescent lights were left on making sleep nearly impossible. I booked the flight direct and they decided last minute to stop over in Montreal and pick up more passengers. Meaning from the time I boarded in Toronto I waited about 3 hours before I was served a lukewarm dinner which barely passed as edible. The flight crew were very nice however served extremely slow. My finished dinner was sitting in front of me for about 45 minutes before someone took it away. The plane itself was also not something I would pay for. The seats were extremely small (the smallest seats I have ever been on) and the aisles were so narrow I hit elbows the whole way down to the one of two washrooms onboard. Overall I was extremely dissatisfied with the experience. There's a reason the tickets are so cheap. I would definitely pay the extra in order to not have to fly with them again.
3436,Flight from Auckland to Shanghai: Check In: friendly but not very helpful staff when I raised an issue the only answer was: give feedback on our website this is not what you expect as Frequent Flyer and passenger flying in Business Class. Business Class seat: worst seat ever seen on a long-haul flight. The seat is a very old recliner seat even not electronic but manual adjustment of seat position. Very uncomfortable. Food very bad (quality and taste very limited choice). Service: OK but not on Business Class level. Conclusion: NZ is completely overrated they have old aircraft's with old seats and the food and service is far below competitors!
3437,My wife and I just finished a 2.5 week trip to New Zealand. The flight and stewards were excellent however the trouble came when checking in at Auckland airport to come back to LA. We were going through to customs and a lady called us and said we needed to weigh our two carry on bags. Apparently they have to weigh less than 7kg and one bag weighed 9kg and the other was 11kg. My carry on bag itself weighs 3.5kg empty. The lady tells us we have to turn around and go all the way back downstairs to where we checked in. We were already pressed for time and now were in danger of missing our flight. We go back downstairs and there is one lady covering all of the checked bags. We wait in line and she then commences to tell me they have to be below 7kg or it will cost me $200/bag. Also they need to be consistent in this policy. As the lady stopped us before customs to weigh our bag 10 people walked by with bigger bags than mine. I hope they review this policy as they are getting a lot of bad press and a lot of unhappy economy class patrons who last time I checked still represent the majority of seats on the planes!
3438,The flight itself was just the same as any other airline no problem. But what really annoyed me was the treatment I received at check in. We flew from Blenheim to Auckland. A family group of 4 of us checked in. Maybe one case out of the 4 was overweight but they took into account that in total others were lighter and we did not exceed the overall allowance for 4 persons. All good so far. They insisted on weighing my hand luggage which had been stripped down to a few light items but the main content was my CPAP medical machine that deals with my sleep apnea condition a camera tablet and lap top. Overall weight was about 9kgs about 2kgs over the limit of 7kgs. The check in man told me that I was over the limit and would have to remove some items. I pointed out that I had a laptop hoping he would then just let it be. On the flight to Christchurch the Air New Zealand check in told me 9kgs including a laptop was OK and let the bag go. This time the man told me to remove the laptop so he could weigh the bag again. It is an ultra book so extremely light which still made my bag 8kgs. He still wasn't happy and insisted that I remove more items. This was extremely embarrassing for the sake of 1kg but in the end we placed some items in a plastic shopping bag which my wife was allowed to carry on because she only had a handbag. This reduced the weight down to 7kgs which made the check in man happy and I could then put my very light laptop back inside. Rules are rules fair enough but for goodness sake. My wife had next to no hand luggage why couldn't they just aggregate the weight for our group or at least for the 2 of us? In the end I put the items back in my bag anyway but the irony was that it was a small plane and the overhead lockers were too small to even take the regulation hand luggage bag I was using so it had to stay on the floor under the seat in front. So it wasn't as if the bag would have been too heavy for the overhead bin anyway. I expect this kind of treatment from a LCC but not from a full fare carrier like Air New Zealand. It was very embarrassed and it just left a bitter taste for the whole flight. I won't be rushing back to Air NZ I can assure you.
3439,"Flew MEL-CHC-ZQN-AKL-MEL A320 and ATR72. Legroom on the Trans Tasman flights are a joke in fact the domestic A320 aircraft have more legroom! Movies on the Trans Tasman flights are quite dated and definitely nothing current on show. Catering for those who paid for it was just ok nothing special. Service by crew was ok I missed out on drinks (cabin crew didn't make it to my row) even though I paid for ""The Works"" fare. This experience certainly does not convince me to fly them long haul I would definitely recommend Qantas on the Trans Tasman flights."
3440,Have travelled several times with this airline - food leaves a lot to be desired. Seated next to a young child maybe 2-3 years old who for the duration of the flight never stopped screaming - I know this is not the fault of the airline but this is not the first time I have had to endure this flying with this airline. Having said that I will still continue to fly with Air Transat but please make an effort to improve the inflight food even if it makes the cost of flying a bit more.
3441,Vancouver to London. I booked my (direct) flights way in advance only to be told two weeks before my trip that my return flight was now stopping on the way. After many emails asking to be put on another flight any other day and being told that there was nothing available I noticed my flight was still being advertised as direct a week after they had changed it. After another email stating that they were false advertising magically they found me another seat on a flight the next morning. The food is rubbish and not enough of it only one meal on a 10 hour flight also the exact same as the outbound flight no option to even purchase anything except pringles or crisps. The wine - I'm not sure where they get the stuff they serve with the meal but it is absolutely the worst after that you have to pay a premium if you want another drink. I don't get it how much could it cost to have a couple bottles of wine vodka and beer on hand to give to the passengers? The service is mixed some of the check in staff I have encountered have been amazing making calls to get me better seats and others have been very rude. Flight attendants are mostly nice and some exceptional. The entertainment is a great new system that has worked quite well for all but one of my flights. They have some new movies but they dont seem to change them very often most of the TV series were the same as they were a year ago. All in all I wont fly them again and I wont recommend them they just kind of feel cheap like your flying a short domestic flight where it doesn't really matter.
3442,"Certainly a real mixed bag when it comes to offering my opinion on Air Transat. Okay let's start with the good we paid the additional fee for the ""Option Plus"" and it provided us with what they said it would. Priority check in seat selection priority baggage handling and a few extras on board. For the round trip ticket (Vancouver to Glasgow) the price was better than the two big guys (Air Canada and British Airways). Flight both ways right on time and although we had an hour stop in Calgary at least we flew into Glasgow and avoided the ""Heathrow nightmare"" and believe me avoiding Heathrow was an absolute bonus. Seats were reasonably comfortable lovely mood lighting and a fairly good personal entertainment system. Service by the cabin crew was good on the round trip so all in all I would say the flight was quite satisfactory. Now the bad the food that was served was simply awful and I have no doubt the fight attendants knew that. I've made numerous trips back to the UK in the past 45 years and I honestly can't recall airline food being as bad as what Air Transat served on this flight. It really defies logic in my humble opinion as to why they couldn't add an additional ten to twenty dollars on a ticket and provide passengers with a reasonably quality meal. Ten hours on a flight to the U.K. so yes food is going to be served but really this food was simply terrible if they served food like that in the prison system they would have mass riots to deal with!"
3443,Travelled PER-AKL on Air NZ aircraft was a B777-200. Must admit I was a little disappointed with the level of service which I found to be a bit inconsistent. The cabin manager and a couple of the staff in the business cabin were excellent but were let down by a couple of their colleagues who looked like they were just going through the motions. One of these was an older member of the team who just didn't seem to have the friendly disposition and level of service you would expect when travelling in a premium cabin. The positives were the food and wine which was excellent. The negatives were the bed and the IFE in my seat went unserviceable fortunately there was a vacant seat so I was able to move over to that! When it did work the bed was of a good quality and the IFE had a good screen and wide variety of choice. If they are going to do a personalised service they need to get the persons name right as after I had corrected the flight attendant with my name I was then referred to as someone else later in the flight.
3444,777-300. AKL-LHR. The seats are ridiculously cramped they may be OK if you are waif-like but anyone else will struggle I know that airlines cram in economy passengers so they can make money on the premium seats but Air NZ has gone too far. I felt sorry for the crew negotiating the narrow aisles and having to be polite to disgruntled passengers. The in-flight entertainment and meals were of a high standard but that doesn't make up for the physical discomfort. I travel to and from Europe at least once a year and my airline of first choice has always been Air NZ but the experience has got so much worse over the past couple of years that I won't be travelling Air NZ long haul again.
3445,LHR-LAX return. Have to say both flights were the most uncomfortable ever. Very hot on both legs and even the stewardesses were complaining about the heat. Also seating on the 777-300 is very cramped. BA or Virgin next time i think.
3446,"Flew Kuala Lumpur to Chengdu D7326 (Gate Q14-KLIA2).  Completely full flight with mostly Chinese travellers. Seat 46G, overall a normal flight with satisfactory product offer. Arrive on-time and meal is just ok."
3447,"Flew from Gold Coast (OOL) to Kuala Lumpur (KUL) on the 13th May 2015. I had booked a flight from Sydney to KL, but the flight was cancelled a month prior to departure with no explanation given. They shifted me to a flight that would have left me stranded in Kuala Lumpur, unable to catch my connecting flight to Europe. However, they
did offer me a full refund, which was processed quickly and efficiently. As I was based in northern New South Wales at the time, I booked a flight from Gold Coast instead. The online check-in was quick, however I was placed in a middle seat. On board the plane, let's just say I was lucky enough to have some pretty powerful sleeping pills. The Economy seating on the A330 was cramped and narrow - something which you don't want when you're 6'1"" tall. Additionally, you have to pay for entertainment - something you don't usually expect on a 9-hour flight. The cabin crew could not make themselves clearly understood either. I will say a few good things about the airline, though. I had ordered a nasi lemak when I booked the flight - this is unbelievably delicious and thoroughly recommended. Also, AirAsia X is incredibly good value for money. In conclusion, I would recommend AirAsia X, so long as you have patience and the gumption to pre-order food."
3448,As I write this my wife is trying to get home from Bali. They promoted their new direct flight from Melbourne to Bali late last year which we booked only to be told two days before departure that they never had authorisation for that route. As a result she had to travel through KL and this added an extra 8 hours to her trip. They promised that the issue of the direct flight would be fixed before her return trip and guess what. Another text two days before she returns home saying that she is going through KL again. Then the morning of coming home the Flight to KL was cancelled and she was put on an earlier flight meaning she had to leave her hotel in a mad rush at 4am to get to the airport. In total it will now take her 16 hours to get from Bali to Melbourne with this joke of a so called airline. Add to that the customer service is poor the planes are dirty and they promise things they have no intention of delivering. Never again.
3449,Kuching to Penang. Flight was scheduled at 7.55pm but was delayed to 8.30pm most likely due to bad weather. Boarding was fast seat was extremely narrow and I was rather shocked about it as only recently I flew with MAS. Flight was very bumpy but this is most probably due to weather. Food was rather tasteless and is not worth the price. The ticket price wasn't very cheap either only about RM20 cheaper than MAS. I would have opted for MAS if MAS has direct flight between these two cities.
3450,YUL-ATH-YUL with an Airbus A330 on both legs. I've flown and rated this airline a few months before and this time it was a bit better. The check in process in Montreal and Athens airport went smooth. The seat comfort was good on the inbound because it was the emergency exit row and for the return leg it was fine I was flying on stand by so no complaints. The service and the crew onboard was fine nothing special and the meals were not the best. On the return leg there was an unscheduled stop in Shannon for refuelling (probably because of the weight restrictions) and we were informed when we were onboard. Entertainment was good with a screen on each seat despite it sometimes pausing - the movie selection was the same on both legs. Overall I think this airline is overrated but it's not too bad and it offers a better product and service than the other airlines on the same route.
3451,Travelled with my spouse on August 23/14 to Paris and then returned to Toronto on TS 0489 on Sept 12/14. The flights left on time and seats were comfortable however the $300 additional charged for Option Plus is over the top. On the trip to Paris we noticed that only one other seat was designated Option Plus. We noticed a few things that didn't make much sense to us. If we hadn't booked Option Plus we could have still booked two similar seats at no additional cost and wouldn't have received the Comfort Package ($9) and one free small bottle of sparkling wine and small bottle of wine with our dinner. We arrived at the airport 2 hours in advance both leaving and returning and never had to wait in line so no big advantage here. In terms of our Priority Tags on our bags one bag in Paris took close to 20 minutes to arrive after receiving the first bag so again where is the value for money. On the trip to Paris we were asked if we could have wine instead of sparkling wine (why are customers not given that option). We noticed as well that the food cart went by us at least two times and when we were finally served whatever options the other economy passengers had were taken away from us-we were served leftovers. I suppose on a busy flight with many Option Plus passengers the issue of time would be taken into consideration (this was not our situation). This was our first trip with Air Transat. We travel to Mexico each winter. On the trip home to Toronto I discussed the situation regarding wine selection and timing of meal services with two flight attendants (very cordial) however they were simply following company policy. I should point out that I think we were the only ones with Option Plus. Again we asked for wine instead of sparkling wine and were accommodated (good) however the leftover meal was for a child not an adult-again why wouldn't we be served the same time as the folks in the front of the aircraft. Our bags were first-off in Toronto (good).
3452,Having just returned to the US after visiting New Zealand. I wish to comment on the economy seating on B777-300 compared to the B777-200 AKL-LAX. The seats in the new B777-300 are ridiculously cramped both in width and pitch. I had the fortune to buy the emergency seats on both legs but would have struggled if I had been in normal economy on the B777-300. In addition the extra crammed in seat reduces the aisle width to uncomfortable levels for both sitter and walker. Perhaps you should be calling them Hobbit Seats for Hobbit sized people. Even your steward staff were complaining bitterly about the negative feedback they had received from cramped Kiwis. Did Air New Zealand get any focus groups to try these seat mockups for size or did Air New Zealand marketing people get done over by the people who sold the premium seats? Your superb airline staff cannot overcome the 12 hours of cramped misery that that I heard people complain about.
3453,D7 212 KUL-MEL. Check-in at KLIA2 is very efficient. Boarded on time but a technical fault with the APU resulted in a 45 minute delay. Once underway the meal service was slightly chaotic though everyone did get their pre- booked meals in a reasonable time. Cabin crew appeared slightly flustered for a lot of the time. Crew friendly and helpful though. Seats are undeniably narrow (16.5 inches) but seat pitch no worse than most at 32 inches (and 2 inches better than Jetstar's Dreamliner). Definitely recommend paying the bit extra for a 'hot seat' with extra legroom (I had 17C). The Quiet Zone seats are rubbish.. Same seating as further back and whilst there are no children in this forward cabin there are still plenty of loud adults. Much better to select a bulkhead hotseat and stretch out there. Overall a reasonable flight at a fantastic price!
3454,I flew to Melbourne from Bali with Air Asia Indonesia X on 21 March 2015. This price included 20 kg of checked in luggage a meal and a small bottle of water. AA ground staff and software need to be improved. When I boarded the plane I found a man sitting in my seat. I showed him my boarding pass and he showed me that he also had a boarding pass for the same seat! I waved to the flight attendant and she came over and told me to wait. After five minutes she returned with a passenger list and sent the man to another seat. There is no entertainment available on an Air Asia Indonesia X Airbus A330 plane. Seat width and legroom are also tight. As the flight was only one third full many passengers were able to sleep spread out over three seats. The Air Asia Indonesia X plane left on time and arrived punctually in Melbourne. Overall I prefer to fly in a Jetstar Boeing Dreamliner rather than an Asia Indonesia X Airbus A330.
3455,Flew SYD-KUL 7/3 quiet zone and Business return on 23/3. You pay for what you get but compared to 6/12 months ago no choice in drink selection or snacks and prices have increased dramatically. Business class toilet had toilet rolls as tissues soap dispenser leaked and staff could not fix it. Suddenly it appeared that supplies were limited or restricted by the suppliers? No lounge at KLIA2 (being repaired). The full service MAS is appearing more attractive now as prices are becoming closer.
3456,I travel quite frequently between PER and KUL and in last six months on several trips I have been moved to other flights causing much disruptions/inconvenience to planned bus/train connections. I have a trip coming up in about four weeks and discovered (through manage by bookings) that they have moved me to other flights again. They have not even notified me by email/sms.
3457,KUL-HKT-KUL. I accept that if you don't pay to choose a seat it will be selected randomly. But to split people up on the same booking (my wife was in the row behind me) is ridiculous. Outward flight 15 minutes late (it appeared that someone's bag was being offloaded so maybe someone failed to board the flight) before arriving into the chaos of Phuket airport arrivals (I reviewed this airport separately).
3458,Just flew four sectors with AirAsia and couldn't fault except for limited menu options at the end of the flight from Sydney to KL. Only complaint would be about their partner optiontown. I paid for an upgrade and booking fee for 2 via their website about 2 months prior to our flight. About 4 hours before the flight I received an email saying our flight upgrade was unsuccessful. We got on the plane to an announcement that there were upgrades available to business class for almost double what we originally paid - 4 in fact. We feel ripped off. I do not accept their were 4 business class cancellations. Either Air Asia or their partner Optiontown are guilty of charging our booking fee for no service.
3459,Flew with them this week between Bangalore Chandigarh and back to Bangalore. I feel the airline has potential if handled properly. The ground staff leave a lot to be desired. Our flight from Bangalore although boarded on time the crew could not clear for quite a while. Pilot seemed to take each thing at a time effecting delay. The return leg was further confusion as fog delayed the incoming flight but no one was interested to let the passengers know the same. No announcements. Also in the aircraft the crew just forgot to ask all to switch off the phones. If it is not much of a problem then why push for it all other times. Where is the safety when the announcements were not completed. No smoking announcement not made. Some positives though. Good pricing strategy. Fresh aircraft and good potential if staff improve.
3460,Toronto-Paris and Amsterdam-Toronto for a group of 4. I was able to check-in online for the Toronto-Paris flight but there was no option to check-in online at Amsterdam. When we got to Paris we had use buses to get to the terminal which were very crowed. The flight was very small and tight. They designed the seats to fit 9 in each row on a A310. Even the attendants were having a hard time pushing the cart through the isles. Ensure to bring your own headphones pillows and blanket as they are not provided. They charge $9CAD for them. The food was just horrible with no flavor at all. Bring your own meal. Definitely as budget airline but definitely not worth the price they charge. It'll be worth the extra money to book with a national carrier.
3461,Gatwick to Toronto 2/09/2014 and return from Montreal 8/09/2014. Both flights were on one of the new Airbus aircraft and both flights were not an enjoyable experience on the way out there were screaming children for a total of 7.5 hours and on the way back we had the dread of all air travellers 2 young children in the seats behind who spent nearly all of the 6.5 hours shouting screaming and banging the back of our seats. Apart from all of that the aircraft seats are fairly comfortable  the aisle between the rows of seats seems very narrow which does not lend itself to having a stroll around to stretch legs. The service is very mediocre and the food on both flights left a lot to be desired. Odd to find that any goods could only be purchased on board by credit card charged in Canadian dollars and not cash.
3462,I flew from Perth to Auckland return thinking Air NZ was as good as it use to be. I was so wrong! Cramped packed flights bad service below average food. I also paid for and did not receive a meal on the return fight. Air NZ you have allowed yourself to slip into Budget airline status. You have lost another long time customer.
3463,Flew SFO to AKL. An absolute nightmare. The plane was full and very cramped. Service was non existent. The staff sat in the galley for nearly the entire time and when I went to get a drink I had to lean over the steward who was reading a newspaper and he sighed loudly because I had disturbed him. No offer of help at all. I ended up pouring drinks for the passengers that where queuing. Toilets were a disgrace and stunk to high heaven. After a year of saving and sacrifice to take this trip it seemed like a huge waste of money. I will never fly long haul with Air NZ again.
3464,I was one of the unfortunate ones whose flights to and from Adelaide were cancelled. Had proper consideration and care been given to customers and appropriate alternate arrangements been made I would have had no cause for complaint. However this was not the case. The re-routing process was a nightmare. Only my partner was re-routed to Melbourne for our return flight while I had to resubmit the request after a few days. Upon checking in at Melbourne airport we were advised that our KL to Penang sector was on different flights and were told to go to the transfer desk at KLIA2. First their customer service centre denied receiving my emails even though I was showing them to the lady at the transfer counter. Then after a few enquiries they said they had not changed my KL- Penang flight because the earlier flight I had requested had only one remaining space left which my partner was transferred into. They apparently did not think it was important to notify us of this to allow sufficient time to make other arrangements. I was told that my flight was full too so he couldn't come on mine on boarding I noticed an empty spot right next to me and another one across the aisle. We arrived in Penang 2.5 hours apart. Not only did I have to pay an additional 300AUD per person for my trip it took me more than twice the length of time it usually takes me on MAS. Flights were on time and thankfully we reached Penang safely. But service was non existent. Hoping the return journey will be less distressing.
3465,My family and I flew from KUL-KUL-NGO. My journey was good although the distance between the seat and the seat should be repaired because of my long legs that required a long distance between seats. AirAsia X is an airline that serve long haul cheap flight so the so the comfort is important although the price itself it is so cheap. For the magnitude of the seat must be enlarged again and replace the seat base material because it does not taste good. My family and I had to scramble a comfortable place because our shoulders is always touching each other. For the food enough and tasty although it must be paid separately from our ticket. For a low-cost airline is all worth it.
3466,I needed to get to Bangkok Chiang Mai and Krabi. To do this within my allotted time span I had no alternative but to fly between these cities. The price differential is quite marked so I elected to try Air Asia which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies ??no explanations from Air Asia. The only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. More of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it. All in all my experiences were certainly negative ones.
3467,TS 429 from CDG Paris on August 28th 12.55 pm to YVR Vancouver BC. You get what you pay for. Cheaper tickets mean rude check in staff dismissive service on board not treated very well by staff members. That about says it all. One word of warning - be prepared to try to stuff your carry on baggage into the size control check apparatus in Paris CDG. I will never again use this company if paying a little more money means people will be treated with respect then Lufthansa will get my business.
3468,August 15 Flight 660 to Punta Cana. Return Aug 22 Flight 661. I think it is great that Air Transat staff now has more time to sell their Duty Free products and collect for charity since they don't have to do much else oh I forgot the drink and 7 little cookies. Both coming and going TV/Movie monitor didn't work properly (different planes). I think I paid the same (I even upgraded) that everyone else does for a decent monitor. 350 people for two bathrooms in the back and one in middle that only people in that aisle used. Certainly not very customer service friendly.
3469,A very poor experience with AirAsia X as this airline is apparently severely let down by their ground operations. I'm 6 foot 7 and require extra leg room to safely make it to the other side. With AirAsia X this requires me to spend some money on an extra leg room seat such is their business model. I have no issues with this and thus spent an extra $100 or so in total but during check in my extra leg room seat was not available. Turns out that you lose your seat preference when you re-schedule your booking online which I did. The online system doesn't notify you of this. If you make a phone call and change your flight dates that way they will actually transfer the seat preference to the new booking but do it online and you'll lose it. This seems like a flaw in their operations. Ground staff offered me an emergency exit row to compensate but this was a middle seat and not in the 'quiet zone' which I had booked. A little annoyed because I wasn't getting what I paid for but at least I had the required extra leg room. When entering the flight (8 hours KLIA-MEL) I was astonished to find out that they had in actual fact given me a middle seat in a normal row and it came down to the cabin crew (who were excellent!) to sort it out short notice. In the end I got the bulkhead seat in the quiet zone which I had selected. I think ground staff might have been looking at a different seat map altogether. All in all a poor experience.
3470,November 26th Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. Early morning flight (departure time 06.00) and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers? I hope we never are faced with that decision.
3471,Just flew Vancouver to Gatwick and return seats are very tiny cramped and almost no padding the food was nearly inedible. The crew however was great very friendly. I really would encourage the airline to upgrade the seats a little and do something about the food!
3472,Air NZ has gone downhill lately and is more like a budget airline. Couldn't use the electronic check in kiosk and there was no-one to help. When we finally found someone she was very rude about our baggage told us we couldn't take one bag then just walked off and left us even though we were within the weight limit. Very rude. We would have been allowed a stroller for our baby but not a bag. Infants are allowed a carry on bag (not checked in) but as parents travelling with young children the last thing you need is another bag you have to lug through the airport. The assistant at the bag drop wouldn't help me get our bags on the conveyor even though I was carrying a baby at the time. Another passenger kindly helped instead. There were spare seats on the plane but they don't put them next to the people with kids who could really use them. Meals were tasty but small.
3473,Airport used was the old Manila Domestic Airport dubbed the Terminal 4 and confuses you of a newer terminal but in fact it's an old terminal with no jetbridges and there is very poor ventilation. Zest Air is a disaster for Air Asia because it cannot be a part of the best budget airline in the world. Their airport staff in Manila are not friendly. Seat of your choice cost PhP100 even on check-in which is free-of-charge on other airlines. Their aircraft's are old and the painting is filthy (dirty) and the seat covers are torn and dirty. The cabin smells and the air conditioning is very poor. The plane I was on had several defective lights throughout the cabin making it darker. The flight attendants were friendly though but still the whole experience was a nightmare. I will never fly this airline again.
3474,"KIX-KUL-KIX. Booked in Jan 2014. In Dec 2014 AirAsia cancelled our return flight for ""commercial reasons"" (strange: Jan 4th is possibly the busiest day of the year for travel in Japan). We had to come back 2.5 days earlier losing our preferred seat in the process. Both flights on time. Boarding in KUL chaotic - one man checking boarding passes manually at gate P5 - causing queue of passengers in corridor just to get into the waiting area near the gate. Food poor (I think it has got worse) announcements far too loud and frequent. Immigration in KL (klia2) pretty quick baggage claim a bit slow."
3475,The start to the trip was not very good poor service at the airport and lack of direction from staff. I guess that's what Air Asia gets for outsourcing their customer service on ground. Plane image looks like its been patched up. Food selection is getting boring. It would be best to bring your own food because if you have flown them before its the same old food. They could at least bring out one different dish on the menu which you can pre order but its all the same. Flight was fully booked so packed like sardines. Flight left 20 minutes late. Comparing the flight with last time it would appear Air Asia X have let their services go and its now going down hill as Malaysia Airlines becomes more competitive.
3476,"12th Nov 2014. Flight: AK139 Hong Kong (1050 dep) to Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2). This is the third airline review I am adding - the previous two I have literally just submitted using a 'minus points plus points' format. I'm not sure that I can think of any minus points for this flight. There was nothing amazing about it but it ticked the boxes that this low-cost airline pledged to tick. I have scored 3/5 for ""Food and Beverages"" because I am required to score but I did not have any as I chose to bring my own on-board. However what the airline offers is more substantial and far better-priced and I would pre-book meals with them in future. As for ""Inflight Entertainment"" that is non-existent as would be expected."
3477,We purchased the Option Plus. That put us in a different line for check in which in the end was not special. It allows for an extra checked bag for each person. On the plane it gets you a comfort kit: blanket eye mask and blow up neck pillow. Sadly they smell like plastic which was ok after being aired out for a week. Leaving from Montreal the airplane did not allow us to control our own air conditioning. 8 hours of flight while being hot and jammed in like a sardine was not great. Each of our seats had a TV screen and our choice of movies and TV shows to watch. The connection for headphones for my son and I was not good and we had to hold the plug in place to hear. The staff were pleasant and helpful on the way out. The way back from Rome was terrible. We thought we had learned from the way over and dressed in cool clothing. This time there was a/c we could control. But the screen was in the center of the plane and you could watch the movie they chose. It took me more than half way through the 9 hour flight to figure out how to get the sound to work. They did have Wi-Fi which helped take away some of the boredom for my son but the battery on my laptop gave out. The staff were rude and dismissive. On the trip back we had to change our tickets returning earlier than the 2 months we had planned. I fully expected to pay a change fee but I was told that can't be done and I would have to purchase new tickets. While shocked by this I bought them hoping that once I got home I could write to customer service and get some help. When checking in our bags I asked if we could please use the Option Plus that was paid for round trip on our first flight to cover the one extra bag we needed to check. I was told no. The guy behind the counter even begged of the supervisor since when he weighed all three bags we were still well under our weight limit. Still she refused and I had to pay over one hundred dollars for the extra bag.
3478,Latest aircraft on a flight from CHCH to AKL NZ 510. Seats do not have any ability to recline backwards (even slightly) leaving tall passengers with a very uncomfortable ride on a brand new aircraft. I cannot imagine who at Air New Zealand made the decision to eliminate adjustable seats on this large aircraft.
3479,Airport staff this time were as efficient as you can get. Check in was kind of a slow process and they do need to learn how to prioritize their lines. Not once did we get a final check in or express check in at the check in counters. By the time I got to immigration we had 20 minutes until our flight left luckily enough the immigration let us cut the line. It didn't really matter because we arrived at the gate to basically stand there for 15 mins. Our departure was at 10.50am we are boarding at 10.50am. Onboard the aircraft my seat was cracked. Staff were quite rude constantly asking us to sit down while they played who to blame for the delay. Captain didn't say anything which I found rude. It was only after 30 minutes that he informed us we missed our time slot. Cabin was quite hot. I never seen such picky flight staff in my life asking anyone who moved seats why they were moving and to proceed back to their seat. For dinner there was no stock left no meal no sandwich no coke. We finally arrived in Cebu only an hour late. ?œYou get what you paid for and I paid only $120.00 for two tickets.
3480,Rating : 7/10 Cabin Flown Economy Value for Money Seat Comfort Staff Service Catering Entertainment Recommended
3481,Flew TAG-MNL or at least attempted too on a low fare. After waiting 4 hours at the airport flight was canceled. Next flight with space for 8 people (my extended family) was in 3 days. We ended up taking a ferry to another city and taking another Zest flight which was itself late. No vouchers for hotel or food. Pure mayhem. Don't be fooled by the fact that Zest has a new airplanes (they do) as this missing part is how to operate them with efficiency.
3482,Afraid I have to join the majority here. I had booked the 21.30 flight from Kalibo to Manila on 6 July 2013 with Zest. A day in advance I got an SMS and email that this flight was cancelled and we were moved to their 23.50 flight. It is almost that time now and we were informed the flight will come in around 2 am arriving in Manila at 4am. Instead of an easy night in Manila with planned arrival 11.30 pm I now foresee a night deprived of sleep. With hindsight I should have paid 8 Euros more for Air Philippines that departed nicely on time.
3483,Outward November 7 D7246 from KL to Adelaide. Return Nov 17 D7247 from Adelaide to KL. The difference between low-cost and full-service airlines is in the was they handle failure. For AAX the way they handle it is - badly. Both our outward and return flights cancelled and re-booked - we were advised this my SMS at 22.45 on a Friday night! It took 4 calls at my own expense to fix it. One of the Premium flatbeds had no power to it so not even the 2 inches of recline you get in economy. Staff said they would fix it - but didn't - nor did they have the courtesy to tell us it wasn't going to be fixed - they simply disappeared off and forgot about us. This was booked as Premium flatbed it wasn't an Optiontown upgrade. We were asked about this several times so I guess if it had been OT they would have cared even less. Our Optiontown for the return flight was not transferred to the re-booked flight. OT has confirmed the refund but it shows the lack of interest of AAX in customer service - naturally when I mentioned this on check-in and asked about OT upgrades they told me the best they could do was to sell me a business-class ticket at full cost. The 5 people I dealt with at KLIA2 (their hub airport) went out of their way to be difficult avoid giving answers avoid assisting arguing why things couldn't be done to avoid actually doing a d** thing and since they all gave conflicting statements I spent two hours arguing with people between flights and left none the wiser. I have to say the flights were on time and the Premium seats that did work were very good but the hassle that accompanied the trip at all stages and the unprofessional and disinterested attitude of the staff in person on the phone and through their e-forms makes me think it just isn't worth it.
3484,"Comfortable business class ""flatbeds"" on longer legs of trip - service good - usually depart and arrive on time. Staff usually very friendly and accommodating but this last trip (Sydney/KUL/CNX) staff were a bit on the reserved side. This is unusual even with the short flights I have taken with Air Asia as well as some other business class flights. My rating for inflight entertainment was 3 out of 5 because one needs to purchase the entertainment separately and I did not use it as I was travelling overnight. Generally and for the most part I would recommend flying Air Asia."
3485,Toronto to Faro 11 Feb. Faro to Toronto 26 Mar. Our options were a non-stop flight with Air Transat or a three leg flight (Toronto-Munich-Lisbon-Faro) with Air Canada. Air Transat cost about $300 each more than AC for economy class. Its planes are all more than 20 years old and this route uses the original seating mainly 3-3-3 in a plane designed for 2-4-2. Leg room is less than AC and seat width much tighter. Food was the worst we have had seen since flying American to California. On the return flight the attendants repeatedly walked the aisles imploring passengers to take the inedible mini-pizzas! YYZ-FAO: arrived early and were invited by the friendly agent to switch from row 28 to bulkhead seats! We chose right side which has half curtains rather than a fixed bulkhead and I was able to stretch my legs out in front of me (I'm 183 cm mainly legs) no extra charge! Unfortunately the 3-3-3 seating does not give enough room for the food carts to pass the fixed bulkhead without slamming them repeatedly against it and forcing through an exercise which was repeated throughout the flight and drove our aisle passenger to find another seat after a few episodes. Overhead screen was directly above our heads so we were unable to see anything. Five music channels with volume settings too low to hear or too high to listen bring your own entertainment. Two rear and one mid cabin toilet for about 240 people is way below what is needed on 6-8 hour flights. Cabin crew were efficient but not overly communicative and not very visible after the meal service was over. The flight left about 20 minutes late but arrived almost one hour early so we had to wait for Ryanair to vacate an arrivals slot at FAO. Return flight was almost 2 hours longer in row 26 middle a claustrophobic experience when the seats in front were slammed back for sleeping. The small overhead screens were showing an animated feature to an audience of snowbirds averaging probably 65years old great program planning. Overhead storage is very limited and too many passengers are permitted to bring oversized luggage causing much frustration for later arrivals. Overall these out-dated aircraft need to be replaced with modern equipment for overseas flights but apparently the once a week flights to Portugal have no competitors so Air Transat can charge higher prices for less comfort and an inferior flight experience.
3486,"I paid extra for priority seating for myself and two companions and received no ""priority"" whatsoever on both long haul flights from Auckland to San Francisco and back. Seating was incredibly cramped. What a waste of money."
3487,My trip from Manila to Tagbilaran was moved by 2 hours and 50 minutes got a 3 day notice from Zest Air 3 hours of wasted time and they refused to rebook me for free. Same thing happened to my return flight Tagbilaran to Manila. This time there was no notice that the flight was delayed by 2.5 hrs.
3488,I have travelled to Australia Melbourne end of September. I have to say that while I enjoyed the seat in Business class and also the service of the friendly staff there are still some points which could be improved. The inflight offer provides max. 5 films and if one has already seen those then bad luck for you. Same refers to the food which is really honestly rather economy class food in appearance and taste. I am sure that apart from having a comfortable seat they can offer a better service here as well instead of using plastic dishes and food that I would rather not eat.
3489,Overall the business class from Beijing (PEK) to Kuala Lumpur (KUL) was fine. The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. The only thing not up to par is the food. The food was indigestible. But I can't really complain when it's only costs $700 USD for business class from PEK to KUL.
3490,My flights were from Christchurch to Auckland return. I was reasonably happy with everything except the seating. On both flights I was allocated a middle seat with no choice of changing. The space between the seat rows has been reduced so much my knees are jammed into the seat in front and when the passenger in front also reclined their seat there is no space to move or read. The passengers on either side of my seat both claimed the arm rests and I had to continually jostle for space. On one flight the passenger in front was not asked to put their seat upright before landing. I used to enjoy flying but now dread the thought of it.
3491,Had a flight December 2012 from Manila to Shanghai. Flight delayed for more than an hour. Other than that I had no complaints on that flight. Seats are spacious and comfy enough. I also booked a returned flight from Shanghai and had to cancel it due to personal matters. Calling customer service via long distance call is quite a hassle but anyway my cancellation was confirmed and they told me it'll be refunded. Well now (5 months and counting) I still do not get my refund. Can't reach customer services. Very disappointing.
3492,Manila-Cebu return. They changed the flight time for both my flights (1hour and 2.5hrs) but failed to inform me properly so I was first rushing to the airport because I thought I was going to miss the flight. Then had to wait in the airport for 3 and 6 hours respectively because of their wrong texts! Both flights were delayed by 1 hour. Their online booking system works only occasionally. I'm never flying with them again.
3493,Have flown other local carriers within the Philippines and think Zest is a step above after my recent flight from Manila to Cebu. Fares were cheap staff friendly at check-in and onboard. Domestic Terminal in Manila is basic but not the worst in the country. Plane was new and flights on time but a limited inflight food and beverage offering. Would fly again.
3494,"Air Asia is trying to operate a Business Class service on a budget airline basis and it doesn't work. I was unhappy with the choice and availability of food the lack of TV screens and the insistence on being charged for your drinks except for bottled water which was given out freely. The cabin was spacious and the flat bed an essential. The price charged should have been higher and the service quality that Business Class fliers expect should have been provided. This all palls into insignificance against Air Asia X cancelling my flight that I had paid for 9 months in advance citing ""Commercial Reasons"" for this - in other words they hadn't filled enough seats for the flight so they cancelled it and bundled the passengers on to the next flight. This left me facing an overnight stay in Melbourne airport. Air Asia is doing something nobody else is they are trying to offer low cost Business Class service using the Ryanair model. It doesn't really work and travellers like me would be happy to pay quite a bit more to get the proper level of service. I think they have cut off their nose to spite their face."
3495,For the HND to KUL route in September 2014. We've also taken this exact flight/route before. Good Value i.e. it was cheap. Otherwise counter service in Japan was horrifically slow more than an hour resulting in a hurried rush through security and immigration to make the plan which is parked at the very most remote gate at the terminal. This was the case as well on the earlier flight. For a long-haul overnight economy seats are just not comfortable enough to sleep. Fortunately in both flights we had an extra seat in our row. There seating is 3-3-3 for an A330 which is one extra seat more than other airlines. Back is very noisy but they do have a quiet area up front of the cabin for a few extra rinngit.
3496,"ICN-KUL-MEL and signed up for the upgrade through Optiontown. I got all ICN-KUL KUL-MEL sections upgraded to the business class however they did not give out ""confirmation letter"" which confirms that I got upgraded. Instead they sent me ""Pending subject to availability"" letter which was saying that I ""might"" get upgraded so I have to see at the airport. Because of this uncertainty I didn't know what to do with my baggage allowance. I had 30kg of baggage so if I didn't get the upgrade I had to buy the baggage fee online before departure. If I waited until I get to the airport and I didn't get upgraded I would have to pay very expensive weight charge for my baggage. I didn't want to gamble so I just purchased 30kg of allowance online before I go to the airport. I paid $100. I arrived at the airport and checked with the staff at the counter and she told me I'd got upgraded! How annoying! I just wasted $100 for nothing! I don't understand why they give out those uncertain not sure e-mails. If I knew that I was going to be receiving those ambiguous decisions then I wouldn't have signed up for the upgrade."
3497,AK827 on 23/9 from Phuket to KL then KL to Sydney on 23/9 Flight D722. Return was on D223 Sydney to KL on 7/10 then same date KL to Phuket on AK222. I booked well in advance for a trip to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur and am a frequent flyer with Aisr Asia so am aware of the restrictions for the excellent price and service which is provided. I would have liked to have been informed that there was no Business Class Lounge at Kuala Lumpur airport and also it would have helped if they had given us some idea of the great distance between Gates. I cannot fault their service at the desks through the Gates and on the aircraft. Business Class is extremely comfortable and with the exception of the food and beverage arrangement which I was aware of very good.
3498,AKL-LAX in Economy. Great to finally use the check-in machines at AKL for flights to N. America (now we just need online check-in). Efficient boarding and the dinner service was prompt after take-off which maximises sleep time. Dinner was a nice but salty corned beef. Seat is comfortable crew were professional but rather cold. Breakfast was fine - but I find most airlines breakfasts nasty so this is a plus. It'd be interesting to see what my opinion was if there was any competition on this route for NZ. But for a monopoly the experience was more than good enough.
3499,MNL-BCD return. You get what you pay for. We got the early morning flight to Bacolod only to find out the flight was cancelled. Had to go back home for the afternoon flight. Same thing with our return flight to Manila - morning flight out of Bacolod cancelled. Hotel staff at Bacolod informed us it is a usual occurrence. Such a big inconvenience if your vacation time is limited or you have to catch a connecting flight. Would rather fly with Cebu Pacific or Air Philippines.
3500,A good value airline. The flat bed doesn't lie flat but is able to be tweaked into various configurations. Food is OK. If you are elderly or disabled ask the flight attendant to organize a wheelchair/buggy to take you from plane to train/bus/car as KLIA2 is a truly monstrous space some gates being a 40 (forty) minute walk away. You will have to wait for others to disembark but attendant will take you through customs and on to train/bus/exit. This is a free service. I will fly with Air Asia x again.
3501,AirAsia Philippines is the worst airline I have ever flown with we were flying from Cebu to Manila and back. The boarding process was a disaster with everybody wanting to go in at the same time and nobody tried to even control the flow of passengers. At check in they managed to put our daughter 8 years old in a different row than the parents. On the way back they managed to put our 2 children (5 and 8 years old) in row 6 and the parents in row 26. For a fee they could change seats - this is not normal in my eyes and it would have been normal to put us all in one row. The person who checked us in acted as if he was tired and doing all he could.
3502,"We flew from Denpasar to Perth yesterday and will never fly this airline again. We checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows (my husband and I were flying with our two kids). Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought ""oh well it's not the end of the world"". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security). I was basically in tears by this time and finally a kind passenger gave me $10 so I could buy something for the kids to eat. I will never fly with this airline again."
3503,"The outbound flight was one of the worst flights I have ever experienced, in over 40 years of flying both as crew and a fare paying passenger. The handling agents (aviator) at LGW tried to charge for a hold bag which had already been paid for. Then the agent concerned to add insult to injury upgraded her friends who were on the flight in front of me at the boarding gate. The cabin crew were rude, surly, and never smiled once during the flight. On the flight the on-board service was rubbish, just fell short of them throwing the food at you. The pre purchased hot meal was over cooked which meant most of the meal was wasted. The cabin crew were a total let down to the airline. However the return flight was different and I cannot praise the cabin crew highly enough, they were friendly, and could not do enough for you. The pre ordered food was excellent and the cabin service was slick and efficient. On the return there were regular updates from the cockpit - outbound there were none only the internal messages to the crew. My advice is be careful when booking as the flight arrival times in Riga can make the outward travel in Latvia expensive or may mean an overnight stop in Riga. Also the airlines fleet of Boeing 737 is fairly old with an average airfame age of 11 years. My rating for the out bound flight LGW-RIX is 0 and for the return flight is 9, so I have given the airline an overall rating of 5/10."
3504,I debated whether to book Air Canada or Air Transat to fly from LGW-YVR. Air Canada has made it tougher to get miles and upgrades and introduced a high-density aircraft on the London-Vancouver route. I decided to change it and take Air Transat from Gatwick to Calgary (was half the price of the Vancouver flight) and picked up a local connection from Calgary to Vancouver. Air Transat vs Air Canada. Although there was more leg room and a new plane I would not fly Air Transat again! 1) The toilets did not flush properly and there was a back log of used toilet paper stuck in the toilet. No one bothered to clean them. 2) The movies were out of date. Dated back to 1990's. They did not play any new releases. Basically there was nothing to watch. 3) You had to pay for blankets and pillows snacks and alcoholic beverages. 4) The fire exit seats were by the toilets and the poor passengers were freezing. The pax sitting in the middle aisle of the fire exist seat only had one screen to watch a movie. The seat of three had only one screen in the middle. 5) The food on the plane was not better than AC. 6) The duty free was rubbish. 7) All stewardess were sitting in a row of seats at the back. Sitting and chatting and when I asked them for a duty free product they couldn't even stand up and help. They said that the duty free would come through the aircraft just before landing.
3505,MEL-AKL Sep 2013 on 777. Business class overall generally what you'd expect but more expensive and not quite the experience of other trans-Tasman options. Herringbone seating comfortable enough but I am not a fan of the angled nature of it; window seats angled into the cabin making looking out of the window difficult. In-flight entertainment food and beverages and service competent but not outstanding. Air NZ lounge in Melbourne nothing to write home about no view other than the underside of docked aircraft and minimal food and drink.
3506,"Good one way stranded passengers on the return flight. A330 flight from SYD to KUL return. Aircraft was a refurbished Dragonair plane. Comfortable seating with the Quiet Zone a plus. Purchased inflight entertainment on Samsung Galaxy tab only worked for a few hours of the flight so was not very good value. Purchased food (nasi lemak) was excellent. Flight attendants friendly though a little timid and unsure of themselves. Flight left 20 mins late but made up the time. Return flight was cancelled with only a few days notice leaving passengers stranded and forced to find their own way home. This was a real disappointment. I now feel uncertain purchasing Air Asia tickets will my plane take off or will it be cancelled ""for commercial reasons"" (i.e. there were not enough people on the flight so we just cancelled it)? In the future I will pay a little more for a full service airline that will provide all the food and entertainment for free and will make sure I get to my destination one way or the other. It's worth the extra cost. It is impossible to get the telephone service centre or anyone else at the airline to help you with a problem like this they just don't care."
3507,Out of the 9 Air Asia flights I took in May and June 2014 5 of those flights were late by more than 40 mins. Another bug I have with Air Asia is that they do not notify passengers of flight changes dates etc. They simply change itineraries and let passengers find out themselves. I have flown with them for 7 years and I'm losing patience at the way they do not care for passengers who support them. They are not cheap anymore. Scoot are far more reliable and a similar price ex Sydney. Once my pre-booked flights for 2015 are used it's bye bye to Air Asia for me. Too little too late! 50% good is not good enough!
3508,Delayed for almost 20 hours without food water and accommodation in Kansai airport. It was a midnight flight. No announcements to update status until 3 hours after departure time. Handled the exit and collection of luggage in a messy manner. Worst airline that io have ever taken. Unprofessional and doesn't care about passengers. Only having profit in mind. Didn't even care for passenger carrying sleeping child. They have to queue in a messy manner to collect departure card from AirAsia ground crew.
3509,When I fly a budget airlines I expect a budget experience Air Baltic was hardly a budget airline. Between baggage fees and airfare my ticket cost more than if I'd flown Lufthansa. I flew Air Baltic from VNO to LGW via RIX. The people on the Vilnius-Riga leg were friendly enough but the system for check in was ridiculous. I was traveling on a business class ticket which meant I was allowed 2 pieces of hand luggage even according to the sign at check-in. Yet the woman insisted that I was only permitted one. I also knew I might have to pay for my checked bags. Fine but simply printing my boarding passes took roughly 35 minutes from the time I got to the counter. The woman at check in had to call someone else to get prices even though I knew it was ??0 per bag. Then another woman had to come down to take my payment. She came but then had to leave before taking my payment. I was asked to wait for her to come back. I finally got my boarding passes but was still waiting to pay. After waiting for about 15 minutes they told me to go up to the ticketing office to pay there. So I went upstairs and stood in line for another 45 minutes. There was only one woman working. I felt bad for her but she was incredibly slow. There was no priority given to large number of people who had to pay and still get through security. Instead she handled lengthy non-time sensitive matters first. By the time I made it out of the ticketing office the security line was horrendously backed up. I barely made it through security in time. Again people were friendly on the plane but the aircraft was old and didn't look particularly well maintained. On top of that the landing in Riga was one of the worst I have experienced in quite some time. Do yourself a favor if you can and fly another airline.
3510,Manila to Legaspi. Ticket bought 1 month in advance via Internet for about 15EUR no problems paying by card. Unfortunately had the same experience as Mark - the flight was cancelled. The official reason was bad weather in the target destination but later on met people having travelled to the same destination the same day but with Airphil. A majority of passengers were rebooked for the next day (they basically merged the 2 flights ??was the low number of passengers the reason for the cancellation?). The next day everything OK the flight without problems. If you don?™t care about time fly with Zest ??it is cheap.
3511,Kalibo (Boracay) to Manila flight was full. Booked 2 months in advance for roughly 1100 PHP taxes inclusive about 20 Euro. Could not complain more legroom than on Air Berlin. Flight on time and crew efficient.
3512,Flown Zest Air 9 times and on 8 occasions the flights have either been delayed or cancelled. The customer service staff on the ground are generally incompetent and unprofessional - listening to their ipods and eating instead of serving customers. They frequently provide inaccurate information about flight delays and the customer complaint procedure will leave you pulling your hair out. So why do I fly with them - because they are cheap and thats the only reason! Would I recommend them - No! Unless you don't mind frequent delays and a cheap price.
3513,26 August. Flight D7317 Beijing to Kuala Lumpur then D7182 Kuala Lumpur to Colombo. The Counter staff were efficient and onboard staff spent most of their time sleeping or doing their own thing but the baggage staff were the worst I have experienced in 10 months travelling around Asia. They do not explain anything and basically treat you with contempt if you have an issue. The food was mediocre at best and while a cheap flight it was outweighed by the expenses associated with their poor baggage handling and attitude towards explanations and customer service. Next time I think I will pay the extra and fly with a better quality airline. Budget doesn't mean rude and incompetent.
3514,Flew MEL-KUL. Premium via airport paid upgrade. The positives: 1. Melbourne check in was pleasant and efficient. 2. Cabin crew pleasant efficient and professional. 3. Premium flatbed seat comfortable. 4. New KLIA2 terminal a vast improvement over LCCT but far too big and poorly designed. The negatives: 1. Had an Optiontown upgrade request for this flight paid for several months ago. Did not get upgraded yet when I went to Air Asia's website there were several premium flatbed seats available for sale after I was denied an upgrade. Was offered an upgrade at the airport for $299 which I took. Why would they promote Optiontown and get us to sign up and pay not allow the upgrade when there are seats available and then sell the upgrades at the airport? Highly unethical business practice. 2. Needed boarding pass reprinted for KUL-DMK connection at KUL when I arrived. The transfer desk had no capability to do this - they instructed me to exit immigration and go to ticket counter or use business centre at airport hotel in terminal. I chose the latter paid $3 for the privilege. This is unacceptable This was after checking in online and having the barcode sent to my phone which Air Asia said was not acceptable. What is the point of checking in online to receive boarding pass electronically if you can't use it? 3. Air Asia's loyalty program is totally worthless. Many many flights lead to no rewards. On balance Air Asia just doesn't get it.
3515,Unpleasant Experience - flying with toddler with Air Asia. I flew with my wife and 4-year-old son from Jakarta to Singapore on 12 Sep 2014. Surprisingly three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. I asked the check-in counter officer to change the seats. However he said that the flight was full and suggested I purchase seats in advance on my next flights. Some thoughts on this incident: 1) Is this Air Asia business model? Separating a toddler from his/her parents could PUSH the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. This is shown as an ads on AirAsia magazine. 2) Is safety Air Asia's concern? Separating a toddler from his/her parents raises a safety risk. Suppose an emergency event occurs. Who will help the toddler? Do you think a stranger sitting next to him/her would help him/her? Finally I exchanged seats with other passengers. This definitely causes unpleasant for them. After this incident I do not recommend a family with young children to fly with Air Asia unless they want to purchase seats.
3516,Praya/Lombok to Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2) as a HiFlyer. I booked the Premium Flex fare to enjoy the extras such as 20kg checked baggage and priority seating. Online booking is straightforward if a bit annoying due to the many forced opt-out options one has to explicitly decline. Web check-in however started to be positively jarring: mobile boarding pass didn't work with a European cell number the airport kiosk can't reprint an already issued boarding pass and the whole experience gets very frustrating very soon. Ground staff were helpful but this is too little to overcome the system's shortcomings. Priority boarding is a myth at LOP as there is only a single security line at the gate which opened extremely late. That way everyone finds themselves standing in a long line with no seating while hundreds of empty seats wait inside the gate area. I ended up boarding among the last just to fight for some overhead bin space and reclaim my assigned seat. FAs didn't really seem very engaged and it took some doing to get their attention just to purchase a drink onboard. The flight was okay but the general feel is of a barebone service.
3517,Having recently flown from London Gatwick to Riga and on to St Petersburg and returned. I can honestly say this is the worst airline I have encountered. Not for the plane or cabin staff or indeed punctuality. But by their shambolic systems and un-user friendly attitude rules and regulations. Otherwise have illustrated their ludicrous check in policy/costs and exorbitant charges in more and better detail than I as a transfer passenger you are simply left to your own devices and ignored. If there is an alternative to wherever you wish to fly to please take it.
3518,I flew from BRU-RIX-HEL-RIX-BRU between Dec 29 and Jan 5th. If flying with them I would recommend familiarizing yourself with their baggage policies especially if booking via eDreams because it is not pointed out very conspicuously. I ended up paying nearly 80 Euros for my baggage which I thought was included in the ticket price. My ticket cost about the same as my SK flights between BRU and HEL during the same period last year which included one checked bag. They are also anal retentive about the 20kg limit. My suitcase weighed 218 kg and the check in clerk made me remove stuff to get it under the 20kg limit. This really makes no sense for two reasons. 1) It went in my hand luggage which was transported on the same aircraft. The 1.9 kg that went in my hand luggage was unlikely to put the 737 over its MTOW. 2) It encourages oversized hand luggage. There was no enforcement of the 8kg and max physical size rule. On a small aircraft like a Dash-8 this can create huge problems in the event of an evacuation. My transit experience at their home base of RIX was absolutely fine. There were more than adequate food options which for the EU were reasonably priced. Very good free wifi as well. I had to stay at the airport overnight for my connection to BRU and found some very comfortable leather couches in one of the bar areas which was kept open overnight. On the return flight I was confused as to how they picked their aircraft choice. Jumping the puddle from HEL-RIX was done using a Boeing 737. However flying the 2hr 40mins from RIX-BRU was completed inside a Dash 8 puddle jumper. This is illogical. The seats were cramped for this length of flight and this was quite possibly the first time in my life that I did not at least enjoy the 'flying' portion of a flight. While the cabin crew was friendly and professional and the aircraft were for all intents and purposes spotless I don't think I would recommend the airline. When I added up the hassles over baggage and the extra fees I could have easily flown SK for the same price. Air Baltic needs to either be slightly more flexible in its baggage policies or lower their ticket prices significantly. For a LCC it is overpriced.
3519,I was flying with my 13 year old son from Milan to Helsinki via Riga 17th Oct 2014 flight BT630. There was a passenger who obviously had consumed considerable amount of alcohol and was behaving aggressively and disturbed us. The cabin crew continued serving more alcohol to him. The head of the crew did not offer any help to us but instead of offering to change seats. Me and my son were extremely upset and disappointed with the staff.
3520,Travelled to Toronto with this airline three weeks ago. Check in good and efficient as was security check etc. On board all nice and clean and bright. Flight on time. Seat back TV's good with a selection of films TV shows etc to watch. It was a very smooth flight and the service of food and drinks was very efficient. On arrival in Toronto we had to wait for over one hour for our luggage to arrive. A bad end to a near perfect flight. Our journey home from Toronto was almost the complete opposite. On arriving at the airport we found the longest queue ever for the Air Transat flight. There were no supervisors about to speak to. Seven flights were all queuing for the same five check in desks. We had to stand in this queue for one hour and twenty minutes. With approx 50 people still in front of us two supervisors arrived and shouted for passengers travelling to Manchester to come forward. The plane was obviously a lot older than the one we arrived on. The TV s were in the middle. We had paid Â£20 extra each for our seats. These were near the rear of the plane and there were only two seats not three as elsewhere. Apart from that were no different. We had the usual inconsiderate passengers in front of us who reclined their seats as far back as possible so we had minimal room. Do not bother to pay this extra. It is not worth it. The food was average. The drinks were plentiful and free. The flight was smooth and baggage claim at Manchester reasonable.
3521,Travelled AKL-PPT on B767-300 and PPT-AKL on B747-400. Awarded recognition upgrades to business class in both directions so for us it was great value. Seating on the B747 very comfortable in the herringbone configuration. Standard recliner seats with 2x2x2 layout on B767 is ok for 5 hours but seats are too narrow. Excellent cabin crew and service as always but catering appears to have dropped of recently. Always a great selection of beverages but food offerings just average lately. Entertainment options also not that great with limited new release films. Contract lounge in Papeete is pathetic and almost not worth the effort. Still our preferred airline as great crew compensate for the other shortcomings. Will be glad to see the B767 retired when the B787 comes into the fleet. Will be travelling to LAX next year on B777-300 and will be interested to see if catering is any better.
3522,Used Air New Zealand from Honolulu to Auckland then Auckland to Cairns Aug 23 and Aug 24 and Cairns to Auckland and Auckland to Los Angeles Aug 30. Had a very good impression of the company until the last leg of the trip from Auckland to LA when we were informed that 2 of our 3 confirmed seats were given to other passengers. At first the ANZ associate didn't mind separating our family eventually accommodated us together in another row. Uuncertain if we would fly ANZ again.
3523,MEL-AKL-NSN-AKL-MEL August 2013. Trans-Tasman seats A330 far too tightly spaced eating meal is an uncomfortable process cabin service and food offered both OK. Control over cabin baggage size and quantity on return flight was hopeless with many passengers highly irritated by inability to find space. Self check-in and baggage deposit an affront. Will I be required to clean my cabin area next? Domestic flights OK. I will be back to Emirates for Trans-Tasman.
3524,Boarding was delayed 2 hours because of the incoming flight. This was ok we received vouchers. We boarded the airplane and just after the safety instructions we where informed that there was a problem with an engine. So we waited a further hour when we were informed that we had to disembark. So about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. After an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. So we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. We queued again to the shop. After an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. In both cases an Air Asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. So then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. Air Asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport. Air Asia is fine when everything goes well. But when there is a problem they will rip the passengers off.
3525,I flew from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. The flight was cancelled after we had boarded. We had to queue for hours for various things. Air Asia did the bare minimum to help.
3526,No problem with online check-in - had booked tickets using Air Baltic website at a good price paid for hold luggage when booking so all very easy until reaching Tallinn airport. Flight was to Stockholm with a transfer at Riga and first leg was delayed for an hour. Staff had no idea why but our Air Baltic connection could have waited as there were about 20 of us on the same route. The reason for the delay according to the aircrew was a technical fault and a wait for the replacement aircraft the transfer desk said it was bad weather either way we had a wait of over 3 hours at Riga with a voucher for a biscuit and undrinkable coffee. Got into Stockholm 4 hours later than planned. The lesson to be learnt here is never take such a short flight with a transfer and avoid the last flight of the day from the carrier to your chosen destination as small delays during the day build up to a big one in the end otherwise everything was fine.
3527,Short 50-minute hops on Dash 8 Q400s TLL-RIX and RIX-VNO. I had booked my tickets via an online booking agency so was dismayed to be informed on checking in at TLL that I would be charged a supplementary fee. Fearing that this would be a swoon-inducing off-the-scale penalty as imposed by certain budget airlines I was relieved that the charge was only EUR 10. Furthermore I was advised I could upgrade to an extra comfort seat with no-one next to me this for another EUR 20. Done deal off I went happy - only to discover that the flight was only one-third full and we all had ample space. Two days later at RIX I presented myself at the ticket sales desk to request payment of the check-in supplement only to be directed to a self-check-in machine at zero extra cost. This flight was also one-third full. At least I can say that Air Baltic was very charming when they relieved me of my EUR 30 at TLL.
3528,I chose this company as it had good fares for our trip however by the end of the trip if I sum up all the expenses it required along the way I could have bought tickets for a better airline that provides all the needed services. We had to pay 10 eur per person to do check-in at the counter. Who has heard of that? We received an email a few days before with the online check-in and it didn't state anywhere that if we don't do it online we would have to pay at the airport. Not surprisingly at the airport everyone who was on the same flight with us had the very same problem. The company is not transparent with its customers and it uses these hidden fees so they can cover up their margins. We had to pay extra for every 20 kg piece of luggage seats transaction fees and there were no meals during the flights. So adding up all these costs to the initial price of the ticket I could have easily flown with an all inclusive airline. Coming to customer service it seems that Air Baltic has no idea what that means. One crew member was extremely rude during the boarding process. She replied to my questions in a very rude way. It is sad to see that for some companies the idea of customer service is still a new concept.
3529,"Premium/Business class in the month of August KL - Seoul Busan - KL. Melb - KL Sydney - KL. Recently Air Asia tried to rename the premium class to business class. I found the word business class really misleading because it is not a business class yet premium seat is more like it. Well whatever name you call it you cannot only book the ""new business class"" to and from Kuala Lumpur. If you are flying out to and from any Malaysia small city you are blocked from booking the business class. The implication is that the passenger need to purchase multiple itineraries and no luggage check through to the final destination. Why is Air Asia doing this? It is very inconvenient for business man like us when we need to rush from one gate to another and what more to say rushing to collect luggage and check in again. Imagine with the new KLIA2. One has to be really fit to do the long walk and keep the figure cross that he/she can locate the other gate safely. I travel a lot in the ""old premium class"" sometimes it is value for money when it is on offer. There is not much service and no entertainment but it comes with free meals and luggage. It is not that exclusive anyway economy class passenger can just walk pass you anytime anyhow."
3530,"BT642 on June 20th. BT641 on June 28th. ZRH-RIX-ZRH. Although AirBaltic has a nice homepage its complicated to operate and ""forgets"" settings that you have made (e.g. I selected check-in bags for both the outbound and inbound flights I had to enter this several times and in the end this was only picked up for the outbound flight so I had to pay extra for the inbound flight at the airport). Check-in at the airport costs extra but online check-in and mobile boarding passes do work. No food & beverages not even water. The planes are really old."
3531,RIX-BCN flight. Business is not business. Meal was inedible. The stewardesses are friendly the company is an expensive cheap service company. The offers lack integrity and the overall client attitude is negative.
3532,Flew Air Transat first time 5 June from Calgary to London Gatwick as only airline with direct flight. Check in was delayed 25 minutes as they seemed incapable of checking in more than one flight at a time and they were 2 passengers missing for the earlier Paris flight. This resulted in a huge queue at check in. Luckily we were there early and joined the queue as soon as the flight number showed on the board. Others weren't as lucky. As it was a night flight of 8.5 hrs was expecting pillows and blanket on seats. Nothing. I found I didn't need them anyway as any chance of catching a few zzzz was impossible as they didn't turn down the cabin lighting until after 5 hours into the flight and then only for an hour. They only used one drinks and food trolley per aisle so it took forever to first get a drink and then be served a pretty awful meal as we were near the back of the aircraft. My friend sitting behind me was left with a choice of pasta or pasta. When she said she didn't like pasta they offered her macaroni cheese as an alternative! At the point where they could have turned the lighting down they didn't and then announced the duty free trolley was on its way. Breakfast was a sad affair of partially frozen fruit salad and orange juice. Only good thing was we arrived at Gatwick 20 minutes early. Overall a very poor experience and one I hope never to repeat.
3533,We flew business class from Perth to Auckland 18 July 2013. We were very disappointed to discover that they had changed the plane and that the promised lie-flat seats were not available on the plane. It was just the standard business class recliners. We were offered a partial refund but I just didn't think that was good enough. We specifically booked lie-flat because it was an overnight flight - if we had known that could not be delivered we would have chosen a different airline. I just don't think it's acceptable to do the bait and switch when a customer pays top dollar for a premium service.
3534,Our plane from Sydney was diverted due to fog from landing at Christchurch to land in Auckland where we landed approx 1.30am. All good re flight but Air NZ customer service certainly slipped once they had this unexpected event on their hands. We were placed in an excellent hotel but the information we were given by staff when we landed and by staff at the airport the next day was all different and mostly incorrect. My comment to those reading this if something goes wrong with your flight with Air NZ don't ring (you wont be answered for a long time) go straight to the person in charge at the information desk as soon as possible get the information and don't listen to any other staff!
3535,"AKL-SYD-AKL twice in the same month. 3/4 flights were A320s - commuter workhorse flights that for a 3.5 hour trans-Tasman flight are fine. Seats are a bit narrow and the pitch is too. IFE continues to lag behind global standards--unresponsive/slow system. Meals were good (I was on Works which includes meal seat bag) when I went for the full meal deal. Cabin crew are a different story. These are disproportionately young (based on the equipment they're recent hires) with good intentions but not quite there. On one flight a passenger dumped his entire scotch and coke on me and the FA was too ""chilled"" in getting something to clean it up. Reeking of booze was not how I intended to arrive at my destination. Only an hour later I was offered a complimentary drink for my troubles. On another journey my seat light didn't work; the row in front had no IFE. We were all moved to new seats and required to move back for landing. I understand the thinking behind this protocol but really: 1 row won't make a difference for load and it wouldn't be to hard to ascertain who had moved when it's because the airline's equipment has failed."
3536,"Dubai to Islamabad. I got seating in the front row even then the seat pitch was very short on an Airbus 319. For a height like mine (5 ft 6 inches) I wonder how tall managed in the back rows. Initial announcement and safety demonstration was very quick when the crew was demonstrating it in URDU Language the pilot announced ""ready for take off"" and it was all stopped. Food was served - good quality hot biryani. Drinks were of poor quality. Overall it was a pleasant journey and it offers good value for money. Recommended but only as a second choice."
3537,I was informed via email that my flight had been changed from 4.20pm to 3.00pm which was fine but airport services were in fact terrible! Arriving at the counter at 1.15pm I asked the counter if there was a delay in our flight I was told that there was no such delay for our flight and that our boarding time was at 2.30pm. 2.30pm came and went and there was no announcement made regarding our flight. There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor. I had heard such good things regarding AirAsia but after this and the cancelation of our Clark to Kalibo flight on the 14th of November 2013 I will be very hesitant and wary of using AirAsia again.
3538,Low cost flight low cost quality. Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. Then from Melbourne to Singapore in April 2014. The second flight was cancelled at the last minute so obliged to take midnight flight. Hours standing in a queue to check in luggage. Seats narrow and uncomfortable. No entertainment. Food and drink expensive with little choice.
3539,Prague - Riga - Moscow. Flight Prague-Riga: The personnel in Prague were very nice. The crew members - not even a smile or 'Hello'. Seats - very narrow and uncomfortable. No meal or drinks on board. Not even water. But you can buy it or order when purchasing your ticket. Riga airport. First international airport with no drinking water fountains! No announcements! No signs to find your terminal or even to understand where you are! Flight Riga- Moscow: Poor service I did not like the attitude. I do not recommend this airline.
3540,I paid about 75 euros to check one 23kg bag. That is a lot of money for such a simple thing. Every other airline uses 23kg limits. Now I think I understand why they are so limited. Air Baltic's planes are so old and out of date. That plane was something I would have rode on 20 years ago.
3541,On a flight from Glasgow to Toronto May 25th this aircraft was full to capacity. I had a window seat although I preferred an aisle seat. I never once left this seat on this 6.5 hour flight it was next to impossible to get out move up the aisles with service carts. Could not read a paper as passengers crammed into me could not stretch arms wanted something out of my pant pocket. forget it no leg space cramp's. For the amount of money we pay and have that nightmare of a seat is unacceptable and even if I wanted to purchase duty free that I did not try getting a credit card out of your wallet I would have to ask the other 2 passengers centre and aisle seat to stand up so I can move.
3542,I booked a flight months ago leaving Toronto on May 24th to Orlando returning May 31st. The E-ticket I received showed a return leaving time of 4.10 so I got to the airport 2 hrs prior to expected departure. I was shocked to find out that the flight had changed departure times to 6.10 pm and I wasn't even notified. To add to the frustration the flight is now delayed another 2.5 hrs that means I stayed all day in Orlando airport waiting on Air Transat. Lesson learnt never again.
3543,We travelled from Vancouver B.C to Cancun May 11th 2014 there were 16 of us. Going down was great nice plane good food and great entertainment as it was a 6 hr plus flight. Coming back some of us on May 18th and some on May 25th was a terrible flight. We were crowded in like animals in a barn sat on tarmac for 45 min no air no seat room at all and I am only 5ft 1. I feel sorry for the people that were larger than me. No entertainment at all nowhere to even plug head phones in. I mean really at the price we paid I think we should of had some kind of entertainment for a 6 hr plus Flight. This is unacceptable and I will never recommend Air Transat.
3544,Flew from Auckland to Shanghai (and a connection from Wellington to Auckland). I had originally booked a return flight from London Heathrow to Auckland via Hong Kong but Air NZ axed their LHR-HKG route before I returned. They were not able to book me onto a flight to Hong Kong and so booked me to Shanghai instead and then onwards from Shanghai to London with Virgin Atlantic - meaning I had to scrap my planned holiday trip to Hong Kong and fly straight home - for which I also had to pay extra for even though they caused the route change. Having found previous long haul and Trans Tasman flights with Air New Zealand to be great I was extremely disappointed by this flight. The plane itself seemed very old and was not to clean boarding was very rushed felt like cattle being herded on board (the same leaving the plane too.) The flight was delayed on the tarmac for an hour and this was poorly dealt with by staff. Seating was extremely uncomfortable and I was not able to sleep at all for the 13hr duration and in flight entertainment was mediocre. Food was quite good however there was a complete lack of customer service from the crew except 1 or 2 members. They did not seemed bothered at all with passengers and were not too friendly. Very poor service and will not be travelling with Air New Zealand again on long haul from Europe to NZ.
3545,MEL-AKL-LAX return. Had been looking forward to trying ANZ PY and I was somewhat disappointed. The good things: Superb food better than C on QF oodles of room in the seats great cabin crew on all sectors priority boarding. However seats are uncomfortable. I appreciate the unique design but you just can't get into a good position. They are leather but in my opinion the padding is far too thin and the only way to sleep is to put the seat at full tilt pile up the bean bag with a cushion and lay out straight. Seeing the space the seats take up I'm not surprised ANZ are not going to continue them into new aircraft - they must lose money on them even at a premium fare. The design is also clunky in that nothing works smoothly - you need to force up the armrests and the seat belt is a pain. It has an airbag but it rests uncomfortably on your side. A great idea in theory - but not so good in practice.
3546,ISB-KHI-ISB in the first week of February. Equipment was A319 pretty cramped seating. There was no IFE but given the domestic leg it was not a big deal. Crew got their job done in serving the tiny sandwiches (more like bite size) and drinks. Other airlines serve better meals for the same fare. Flight was delayed 2 hours without any reason given. On return leg the delay was 90 minutes again without any reason. Airblue is OK value for money on domestic routes but delays seem to be perennial.
3547,29 Dec 2013. MAN-Islamabad flight delayed by 3 hours. Very disorganised. No inflight entertainment no entertainment for children. Cabin crew (females) more concerned about their appearance than passengers. Cleanliness was atrocious dried food stuck on seats and food inside seat gaps and front pockets. When opened the food table dried rice and tea or coffee stain found. When asked to clean it just wiped down with dry tissue no disinfectant used. Safety demo were fast and not understandable. Cabin crew and pilot talking through speakers - nothing was understood. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
3548,"MAN-ISB on 22nd Nov 2013 and ISB-MAN on 6th Dec 2013. All I can say is avoid at all cost. I was attracted by the fact that the fares seemed to be about Â£50-80 cheaper than PIA. Outbound flight was scheduled for departure at 22.00 didn't depart until 01.10. Aircraft was an A340 described as the ""latest technology"" on their website there was no inflight entertainment. No music no TV no screen. The flight attendants didn't have a clue where we were during the flight. One was asked how long was left before landing she replied ""about 2 hours"". A few minutes later another attendant passed and we asked her she went to the flight deck and returned and said ""35 minutes""! The service was rubbish. They came out to serve the meals took away the waste and then disappeared for 4 hours hiding behind their curtains in the galley area. All I could hear from other passengers was ""first and last time"". Next time I will pay the extra fare and fly with PIA or Emirates."
3549,With its new web site this airline has gone from being Pakistan's best to Pakistan's worse. You can no longer change bookings online. You cannot ring their contact numbers from outside Pakistan to change your booking. Booking change fees have doubled. And you now loose your money as you can't get a refund on a credit card ticket. Obviously Air Blue is now no longer interested in international passengers including dual national Pakistanis living overseas.
3550,D7 221 SYD to KLIA2 June 6 2014. Boarding was chaotic but I was assisted with a smile to my seat. The seat was so narrow and there was virtually no leg room. Thankfully another passenger's water bottle was leaking from the overhead bin onto me and the flight attendant apologised and moved me to 3 empty seats. The seats were still uncomfortable with the arms rest when lifted up and back still protruded out of the seat nudging me in the back. The food was booked online it was small but delicious nasi lemak.The cabin got cold so I was prepared to provide for my own warmth and choose not to rent a blanket. We departed and left on time. It was very cheap.
3551,Flew lately with them from KUL to PEN and I loved the airline. I also pre-ordered their in-flight meal service which was delicious and promptly delivered once on board. On return flight the flight was delayed by 2 hrs. but I needed to be back in KUL on time so I booked another airline on my way back to KUL. Later I exchanged a few e- mails with their station manager in PEN so they handled my delay costs very professionally. All in all not a bad airline to fly with around Asia. Only negative side is that they use low-cost terminal at KUL which you can not compare with a satellite Terminal.
3552,My 17 year old son and I were on a 43 day round the world holiday. While in Rome I was emailed that Air Asia 29 June 2014 QZ266 CGK-SIN. The whole trip is good. Staff were friendly. The seat was small with little leg room. The Inflight Entertainment isn't very nice.
3553,FCO-RIX-FCO. My outbound flight was rescheduled 2 weeks prior the flight and I had only two options either to accept the change or cancel the whole trip. Overall expensive tickets old Boeing planes hidden charges and poor customer service and support. I would not recommend this airline.
3554,RIX-SVO - extremely slow check in at Riga airport. Crew not friendly and I was denied a claim form on board. The customer service is just odd. It is a very expensive low cost service. The food on board is really expensive.
3555,My family was booked for Airblue from Manchester to Islamabad. They flight time was 2230 got delayed till 05:45 next morning then got further delayed to 06:15. This is not the first time this has happened to the passengers. It is highly unprofessional. Their website has no links for complaints or disclosing of any rights for claiming compensation for delayed flights and inconvenience. Absolutely rubbish airline to book. The only reason I am stuck with this airline is because it flies direct to Pakistan.
3556,Abu Dhabi to Lahore. Flight delayed 2.5 hours. Reached Lahore after 2.5 hour delay but misery was not over. It took 2 hours for luggage to be transferred from aircraft to the luggage belt. So overall delay was 4.5 hours including everything. Inflight staff weregood in behavior. No inflight entertainment. Food was fresh and good a chicken wrap with cold drinks/juices and tea/coffee. Table was dirty I had to clean it myself using tissue before I could eat. During online booking I reserved window seats however at check in they issued me aisle seats. When I inquired about my online reservation the staff were very rude in letting me know that they did not have window seats available. I would not recommend!
3557,Flew from KUL-PEK in early April. It is understandable that when the weather is not that good the flight will be delayed. However it took them ages to sort things out before departure. I was one of the last few passengers to board and yet we waited onboard for quite sometime before the plane started moving. The portions for the inflight food are getting less and less every year. They don't carry enough spare food for purchase. Cabin crews showed no emotion when serving.
3558,PRG-RIX-KBP. Probably one of our worst experiences. When we got to the Prague airport we were told that we had to pay 150 euros for 3 checked bags (none were overweight) and our boarding passes which apparently we were supposed to print out before if we didn't want to be charged (which we didn't know about). We took the bus to the Bombardier Q400 and we boarded without many problems and sat into the small seats. We were absolutely baffled when we found out that we had to PAY for everything on-board not even a glass of water or juice was free. We then landed and spent the next 4 hours in Riga where we exchanged 20 US dollars for Lats so that we could buy something to drink and eat. We were able to only buy 6 small water bottles and 4 snacks for those 20 dollars. The second flight to Kiev had the same circumstances and again would have to pay for a small drink. This time we were on an old Boeing 737-300 which had larger seats. Flight attendants are non existent throughout all flights. Never flying Air Baltic again.
3559,I have flown with Air Baltic for many years and generally there are no issues with time keeping and technical faults. On board staff are generally helpful. Customer Service could be better especially at check in in Riga - often long queues that merge into one - airport check in area is rather small and often the queue is out of the door so it pays to arrive earlier. Airport airside is pretty good now with the addition of new shops. I generally travel the London/Riga/London route which is nearly always full. Tend to be expensive at times - out of season usually the better deal. At least assigned seats - unlike the free for all on Ryanair in which case if you are not Latvian or Russian you will not win because they are queuing for plane 30 mins before boarding starts - look out for the passengers who stand up immediately the wheels touch the runway preparing to get off - it always amuses me.
3560,From Riga to Villnius. The Dh8 is very good aircraft for regional flight. On time take off and landing. Everything o/b you must pay for. I ordered one hot chocolate. Very nice taste. Ground staff at Riga airport were so helpful. Crew were friendly to all passengers.
3561,A group of 22 family/friends travelled together for a destination wedding we flew from Toronto on May 2 with Punta Cana as our Caribbean destination. Onboard staff were friendly and efficient the plane was a newer model with 9 seats across ample leg room and individual entertainment modules. Flight was on time however the check in staff were a joke! A member of our group was overweight on luggage because he was travelling with several young children he was willing to pay the extra fee at check in but was told that he had to go to line up again at a second counter to pay the charge he got into the second line and waited and waited. The credit card machine at the cashier counter was not working properly they would not accept cash they did not have a secondary credit card machine. Finally after waiting about 20 minutes they were able to process his charge. We arrived at the gate 30 minutes before boarding although we had arrived at the airport 3 hours prior to departure.
3562,Fly from Edmonton to Dominican Republic in March. Arrived at airport for check-in 3 hrs before boarding time to find out the flight was going to be delayed by 6 hrs. As the morning progressed the delay lengthened tried to find out information and staff at counter was not helpful was told to call customer service. We did and we had the most rude lady answer the call she actually hung up on us. Sent an email to the customer relations email (which was never replied to). Finally boarded the plane almost 8 hrs delayed. Upon returning home I emailed Transat again. Received an email 4.5 weeks after with them stating that the fine print basically means they aren't responsible for anything and the food vouchers would be given as credit towards the next vacation with them. Lousy customer service and lousy contact.
3563,"Overnight flight NZ2 from LAX to LHR on 22 July 2013. Sat in row 36. On entering the cabin the temperature was cool and soon after takeoff the temperature dropped to ""icy"". Other passengers were clearly noticing the same because there was a large request for blankets. I asked the service people to raise temperature they promised to do it but nothing happened except for some more blankets they gave to us. After one hour I complained again somewhat upset and everybody around could here it. The service staff did not seem to care much about it. They just promised to set the temperature higher but without any noticeable effect. When I was walking through the plane to warm up myself I felt noticeable temp differences between the front middle and rear seat rows. It seems that air conditioning on that Boeing 777 was working pretty unequally. In the end I could not sleep because of anger and dissatisfaction. Icy cold air seems to be a general problem nowadays I have similar experience with NZ night flights from Hong Kong to Auckland and from there to Tahiti. Food was ok. My personal conclusion is to avoid long distance travelling at all in the future."
3564,March 2013 from Manchester to Islamabad and back in April 2013. Take off 30 minutes late we didn't get any drinks nor any food for the 1.5-2 hours. After the food they just left the drinks trolley on its own. The seat arm with all the light and fan buttons - none were functioning. They left the lights on during the night flight which made it very difficult to sleep. Served good food and service was ok.
3565,The flight experience was great value for money. I find the Quiet Zone really a good concept one can sleep. But at check in the service was not great. I had no visa because I thought that I don't need one or I could do it on the spot. The staff were not well trained to assist me. They just gave me a link and I applied the wrong visa which in the end cost me AUD130 and did not allow me to fly the same day!
3566,BKK-HDY-BKK return. Observed significant improvement from cabin crew they seemed to be smiling and really welcomed you on board these flights. Decided to bypass hassle at check-in counter by internet check in pre- printed boarding pass and not loading luggage which is a good decision. The journey become very uneventful compare to the past experience. Aircraft new and clean as usual. Only criticism for buy on board food (evening flight) which all hot food completely sold out what left of sandwiches choices are badly stale.
3567,PER-DPS-PER. Positives were cost clean aircraft and a good selection of flight times. However I was concerned with the level of hygiene in the toilets. On both flights soap was not provided which essentially means that nobody was able to wash their hands properly which is poor infection control particularly when there are 180 people confined to a small space for a long period of time. Flight attendants and crew could be more clearer on the PA system as well. Food good but a lot cheaper if pre ordered.
3568,KUL-MNL-KUL. The airport where Air Asia international flights depart is supposed to be a domestic airport. My flight was at 4.20pm. I arrived at the airport around 1.30pm. Past 2pm they were not still letting us in. The waiting area and check in area is still serving the earlier flight to Korea. They just have 2 check in counters and 2 immigration counters of a supposed to be international terminal. I am from the Philippines and I feel for the foreigners who were with me on this terminal. I hope Air Asia can transfer all of their international flights to Terminal 3. Will take Air Asia to Manila once they transfer.
3569,ZRH-RIX return older Boeing 737-300 in both directions with recently refurbished Recaro seats that were OK but a little cramped. Air Baltic is fine as a low-cost airline - I managed to buy my tickets in a sale - and I appreciated being able to pre-order a proper airline meal with a starter main soft drink and dessert rather than only being able to buy snacks. The lunch was good on the way out and felt like good value for money compared to Zurich Airport but the breakfast on the return was not so good (powdered instant coffee) and was expensive and of a lower quality compared to Riga Airport. Ordering in advance gives you a much larger selection but isn't really cheaper as far as I could see. On-time on the way out 25 mins late on the way in due to bad weather in ZRH but I didn't feel this was really explained. Nice staff. However the ticket prices are often decidedly not low-cost and then what you get for the price is rather scandalous given that you have to pay for all the extras.
3570,Inefficient unhelpful and rude staff at check-in in Tashkent. Charged an additional 40 Euros for luggage despite being an economy not a basic ticket which according to the official website should allow 20kgs free of charge. A scribbled receipt was issued after persistent requests. First flight from Tashkent to Riga took off and arrived on time. Second flight from Riga to Istanbul was late to depart by 30 minutes. Riga airport was chaotic no information was given regarding the lateness of the plane. The planes were adequate the on board flight attendants polite. Poor value and I would not use this airline again.
3571,SNU-YUL with an old A310. It's not the first time that I traveled with Air Transat and I must admit that it was not the best flight. The flight departed late and the cabin was very hot when we boarded because the air conditioning system had broken during the landing of the previous flight. During the flight we hit a lot of turbulence and the crew could not serve any meals during that long period. After that they rushed to do that service. The meal and the crew were fine nothing special. The seat was a bit uncomfortable it's the same comfort for their longest flights to Europe but I enjoyed extra legroom because it was an emergency exit seat. The inflight entertainment was an old movie show on the overhead screens. I also found some announcements made in French were a bit unprofessional but they were made in a joyful tone. Overall despite the turbulence the flight was fine. I've travelled a couple of times with Air Transat to their Europe flights and the crew (some of them are friendly while a few were unprofessional) the service and the seats are all the same nothing special. If you expect a five star service you should fly with another airline.
3572,I purchased Option Plus for a return flight Toronto-Manchester. Outbound leg on April 6th provided excellent check in and also cabin service. Onboard our meal order was taken ahead of the economy passengers and also served earlier which provided a nice hot meal. Unfortunately the return flight on April 14th provided abysmal service right from check in. Even though we were travelling Option Plus red priority tags were not put on our bags by the young lady checking us in and when I pointed this out she told me they will be attached before they go on the aircraft and I should just trust her. Obviously I knew this to be untrue as I have used Transat many times in the past and of course I had to wait 40 minutes in Toronto for my bags. We left Manchester at 9.15 am and lunch service did not start until 2.30pm which is far too late and on this newly configured aircraft (2x4x2) the cabin crew served the meals from the front rows to the back rows which takes far to long if you are seated in the back and you end up with a cold meal. Option Plus passengers were not served in advance as we were on the outbound flight and when I pointed this out I was told I was mistaken. Basically Option Plus is not worth the extra money as the priority boarding and priority services you are supposed are often not delivered. The service is always more miss than hit and seemingly more so with the Montreal based cabin crews. Air Canada Rouge is starting to fly this same route so next month I'll probably give them a try instead. Air Transat cannot complain as I've given them enough opportunities over the year's to get it right.
3573,"Flew from Wellington to Nadi on 13 July. Paid for 4 premium seats including ""the works"" meal option. We were very disappointed in the food as they offered only one choice of meal as they ran out of the chicken by the time they came to our seats (seated in rows 19). My children were looking forward to the chicken option but were offered only cooked Salmon. I question what proportion of people on a flight actually eat salmon. I think the menu designer made a big mistake. So out of 3 of us only one had a meal."
3574,I had a negative experience recently on a San Francisco to Auckland flight. Started with a rude older staff member at check in snapping that I had to pay $150 for my extra bag. I was then told to calm down after asking for some more wine (had had 4 half glasses) sitting quietly in my seat. I was being very quiet and minding my own business. The women staff were fine but the guys were like school teachers and I was made to feel like a child after this. Unfortunately my national carrier and would like to support them but I don't have any concerns with their safety however and the food was good.
3575,LHR-AUH A319. At check-in told the flight was delayed 3 hours however airport information board did not show this delay. After 30 mins the flight was delayed 2 more hours. After 3 hours it was delayed another 7 hours. No responsible person from the airline available for answering queries. In spite of 12 hours delay no hotel room provided. The food given in the lounge was not worth eating. All this while there was no airline staff to facilitate or compensate on anything. A 15 hours delay and no compensation whatsoever. The plane itself was very cramped. The air hostess friendly and food was fine.
3576,Adelaide to Kuala Lumpur once again on board D7247. Flight left on time which was good we got into the air the seat belt sign was left on. Don't know if we were going through normal turbulence but the staff were still out and about. I was quite annoyed with the food service because it just took way too long. Its not like our flight was full also. They already informed us it would be 40 minutes in they would start serving food. An hour and 40 minutes in and they were still at the beginning of my section and the back one was still in the other section. Then we hit turbulence drinks and food was suspended. It was 2 hours into the flight until we got food. Understandable when it comes to turbulence but being over a hour well thats not acceptable especially without a full flight. Other than that the service was what you expected. Nice and friendly and was always willing to help when they could.
3577,"DMK-PHN-DMK via FD 606 and 607 respectively. Flight was on time with a couple minutes late. Both flight was close to full as it was holiday week in Cambodia. Once again nothing much to complain or pride. Except I noticed the quality of ground crew and flight attendant going downward. Unfriendly and very unapproachable. I know this is a low-fare airline however given the price paid for at least a smile or ""welcome aboard"" is shown to the customers."
3578,LOP-KUL 17 May. I checked in online and got the boarding pass. Since I had no checked-in baggage I went straight to the immigration counter which was very convenient and save a lot of time. The flight was delayed for 1.5 hours. Luckily the ground staff provided us with a simple meal. The flight was not full. I had the whole row to myself so that I could lie down during the entire flight. Of course the flight arrived late. The FA was ok. The seat pitch is a little bit short for me. I didn?™t order any on-board meal as I just had dinner prior to the flight.
3579,VIE-RIX-TAS-RIX-VIE. VIE-RIX flown on small Dash 8 aircraft. We pre-booked a hot meal which was good. Also pre- booked seats which proved to be useless. Arrival to RIX was smooth. Had 5 hours between the flights so we went to Riga for a short sightseeing by public transportation. Boarding in RIX was a mess - flight delayed almost no information small waiting room crowded bus to the aircraft. Although we booked emergency exit row seats for quite a high fee our seats were in front of the emergency exit row - the most uncomfortable seats on the aircraft which was an older run-down B737. Very bad flight experience on this leg with some of the lavatories not working TAS airport is like going back in time it took two hours to get the visa and pass immigration and customs. Return flightt slightly better smoother check-in friendlier staff aircraft in a better condition although also one of the lavatories not working. Altogether the services provided was of lower quality than most low-cost airlines.
3580,GYD-RIX-SVO. Air Baltic is a 'cheap' US-style carrier. Air Baltic appeared to be the least expensive option. Arrived at GYD to discover that I had to pay 40 euro in cash for the privilege of checking a single bag. Had I known this beforehand I would have factored it into the price and chosen a different airline. On the plane I was told that I would have to pay for water if I wanted a drink! If I wanted poor American-style service and 'hidden fees' I would have stayed in America for my vacation. Also the plane didn't have the customary map TV on the seat in front of me. For a European airline Air Baltic is absolutely dire. Will never fly again.
3581,TLV-RIX-CDG. Normal LCC. Prices on board ok. Planes new and clean staff friendly. Had some hours in Riga and visited the city. Was sleeping during the flights so missing IFE was no problem.
3582,Flight NZ45 RAR to AKL 23 July - booked The Works in Economy - not worth it. Food was horrible. My partner and I tried both meal choices - fatty butter chicken with rubberised rice and peas or salmon with dried out mustard flavoured mash peas and corn. Managed a couple of spoonfuls of vegetables. Slow drinks service - and then given the wrong wines.
3583,MAN-ISB-MAN (via Ankara). Outbound flight was over 2 hrs late but got a call from Airblue staff 5 hrs before departure time informing me of this. Check-in staff were friendly. Take off was nearly 3 hrs late on small airbus A319 which obviously is not designed for over 4000 miles flight. Seating is configured in 3x3 setting and very cramped. Aircraft was full on both legs of the journey no inflight entertainment at all. Meal was excellent though drinks were served frequently as well as on demand. Flight crew were friendly and willing to help but noticed that they are generally slow in serving meals. Upon landing at ISB baggage was out quickly. Inbound flight from ISB was delayed by 30 mins one hot meal served and from Ankara to MAN only a wrap with a drink was served which I found inadequate for 10.5 hr flight. Overall I found Airblue to be average. Cheaper option compared to others excellent food good inflight staff. However small plane which is painfully cramped and seating inadequate for long haul flight with a lack of inflight entertainment.
3584,KHI-LHE A319.The service was fine with Chicken wrap chips and Biscuit. The comfort level was good and aircraft was clean and tidy as well. However staff seemed to lack a bit professionalism. No inflight entertainment provided. Air blue can be considered as an option against ever inflating fares of PIA.
3585,Manchester to Islamabad with my family on a return trip. When I opened my dinner table it was filthy with food staining. Cabin crew did not appear to care about passengers either due to being short staffed or ignorance. A passenger next to me asked for a paracetamol tablet which took 20 mins to arrive after having to ask for the second time. On my return trip the table enclosure was even dirtier even the safety card had a big lump of old food stuck on it. Our flight was 30 mins late on departure from Manchester. On my return the check-in desk at Islamabad is inefficient we waited over 45 mins to be served. We were given 3 seats together and 2 other seats away from each other. The attitude of Air blue cabin crew could be more courteous.
3586,I flew Air Blue for the first (and last) time. My flight from Islamabad to Dubai was late by 3 hours. The worst part was the attitude of the ground staff which was very rude and discourteous. Whenever they were requested for any information about the reasons of delaying they will not give any proper answer and instead of showing any empathy towards passengers  they were rude and showing attitude. One lady among the ground staff even started passing nasty remarks and made fun of the waiting passengers. I have made up my mind not to travel by Air Blue again and I advise all those who read these comments that go for the better choices available.
3587,Travelled with family on KL-Chiang Mai and thoroughly enjoyed the smooth and on-time flights. The pre-booked meals were ok and the crews service was well above average to my surprise. Entertainment - not applicable.
3588,Return flight from Bangkok to Udon Thanni. The four members of staff at boarding gate were either sleeping or playing with their phones. None took any interest in the customers despite the flight boarding time coming and going with no announcements. On the return flight 5 days later the cabin crew failed to notice 3 extremely drunk passengers who I guess were automatically allocated online emergency exit seats! When I told the cabin crew about this they asked them to move and one of the crew later thanks me. I sat in one of the emergency exit seats and was given no extra information which was unusual as every time prior when seated on such seats the staff took the trouble to make sure I was familiar with how to open the door in the very unlikely event of an emergency.
3589,I flew from Darwin to Bali on 21 April and from Bali to Darwin on 25 April. That was our first time trying Air Asia and we will not try again. On both days Air Asia was delayed for about 2 hour. There would have been no time to have the crew check the plane before it departed again.
3590,"7th May from Jakarta to Denpasar Bali. Flight QZ7532. Every single time I flew AA the flight was delayed. They usually use a random excuse like ""delay due to the late arrival of the aircraft"". This time 15 min before boarding I asked if the flight was on time. I was extremely surprised to hear that yes the flight was on time. 10 min before departure I enquired again as I couldn't see the airplane at the gate. Only then I was told that the flight was 2 hours delayed. As a pilot myself I know that staying on schedule is not always easy but being late by that much without having the ground staff to inform the passengers on PA I thought that was extremely bad. They can't care less about their passengers."
3591,We were on our way home from Riga. When we were checking in our luggage we were told to go to the ticket office. They didn't know why but we had to go there. We guessed that the plane was cancelled. We found the ticket office and they told us they had to use a smaller plane and they didn't have enough seats so we had to travel via Munich. We got our tickets after a long while but with wrong names on every one of them. They couldn't understand this and used a very long time to sort it out. When they did the plane for Munich had left and the started to look for another way home for us. We were then directed via Berlin 4 hours later and had to wait in Berlin for another 2.5 hour. Of course no apologies or meals/drinks etc.
3592,Connecting flight from Moscow (DME) to Duesseldorf via Riga. Flight attendants and overall service was OK for a discount airline. Had to pay extra charges (approx EUR 25) for choosing seats in the aircraft which was not worth the money paid. Planes (Dash 8 on both routes) were quite new but very noisy. Passport control in Riga airport was a total disaster. Queue was moving extremely slow staff very rude. Flight on the second leg has been delayed for 1.5 hours as the aircraft required some maintenance. Overall impression is not bad but wouldn't recommend anyone to use connecting flights via Riga.
3593,RIX-ZRH-RIX. Both flights without any delays polite and responsive cabin crew good check-in Riga airport comparatively fast security control. The only negative experience was Zurich airport check-in staff whose lack of knowledge and impoliteness made our trip back home less enjoyable. I would like to highlight security check staff in Zurich airport who were very understanding. I complained about the unfounded expenses I paid for airport check in ZRH they returned money on time so in general I am more or less satisfied.
3594,We flew into Toronto and it was ok there was enough leg room and staff were ok however the food was awful! Coming back was even worse the food and were terrible and the comfort was poor. It was far too hot. I put the red light on to get a glass of water and I had to wait 30 mins before someone came and asked what I wanted! The movie didn't start until about 3 hours into the flight so there was nothing to do for the first 3 hours. I will never be flying with them again.
3595,Melbourne to LAX via Auckland. Staff Service was good and the food excellent for 12 hour flight to Auckland. Seats excellent - you can not go wrong.
3596,My family and I were a group of 6 who flew from Perth - Auckland - Honolulu return Business class. Perth - Auckland was quite good long transit in Auckland but Koru lounge very good indeed. Auckland - Honolulu appalling. Very tired worn out B767 with the worst Business Class seats we have ever experienced. Service was mediocre. Same for return Honolulu- Auckland. Lounge in Honolulu nothing short of disgraceful and check in staff rude. Very long 9 hr transit Auckland lounge very good. Auckland - Perth promised to be good until Business class was filled with staff travelling on highly discounted fares. Most of them were quite scruffy and untidy. Worst of all the cabin service started at the rear and by the time they got to us in the front and travelling staff all got fed there was not much of a choice left for us full fare Pax. in the forward rows. Cabin staff should have offered full fare Pax first choice It is totally out of the question us ever flying on their old B767 again as it was the worst ever Business class travel we have had and on the B777 cabin staff need to look after full fare Pax much better than we experienced. Overall maybe 4/10 and that's only for the B777 for the B767 flights 1/10.
3597,"Heathrow to Islamabad return. The worst travel experience I have ever had. Flight delayed by 11 hours outbound and 2 hours on return. On both occasions no information was given and staff repeatedly told us ""15 minutes"" and that there were ""problems with the plane"" (not what any one wants to hear just before take off!). Staff were uniformly rude and unhelpful and there was no in flight entertainment at all - even the route screens were out of order. I will not be using air blue again."
3598,LHE - DXB last week - boarding was a bit of an issue with a mini bus trying to ferry everybody to the stand but apart from that happy with service and will use again. Far from the worst budget airline I have used
3599,Lahore to Karachi. Cant argue with their overall service quality nor staff. They served a full meal on the 9pm flight. Slight delay on outbound baggage arrived promptly and all in all no complaints at all.
3600,Trip Satisfaction: Not satisfied at all. Value for Money: Not worth the money. Seat Comfort: Not comfortable at all as the seat was too small. Staff Service: Two of the staff were rude. Food and Beverages: Reasonable and affordable but didn't meet my expectation. Inflight Entertainment: This is really bad as the staff requested to return the tablet to them an hour before landing. This review is for the flight taken from Kuala Lumpur to Adelaide on 9th February 2014.
3601,Flight D7247 departing Adelaide to Kuala Lumpur. Airport check-in staff were very good check in was quick and efficient thanks to online check in. They changed my seat to give me 3 empty seats. Flight left on time. Much to my disappointment I found the flight was quite empty at check in the flight looked full when we left there were 6 to 8 rows empty. Air Asia send out so many promos enticing us to buy empty seats for a flat bed. My only conclusion would be that the airline books them out to try and make the flight full to get us to upgrade. Staff were excellent and friendly food was great value for money. Arrived in KL on time there was queues just to get into the airport itself and immigration would not even fast track people with flights that were leaving soon. KL LCCC is a huge let down but the fact is for the money you pay for you need to put up with it. I have always said Air Asia has no customer service on the ground however in the air they were good.
3602,Had the worst travelling experience travelling to and from Sydney to Phuket via KL. Hated every minute of it. Appalling service from the minute of check in both ends. Do not waste your time nor paper checking in beforehand. Do not buy food on board (maybe chips would be ok). Will never recommend nor use again.
3603,"Yesterday I flew from Thailand to Malaysia. Air Asia charges extra for every possible option. I booked a ""hot seat"" which should have priority boarding. No priority was ever offered and I was stuck in a mad rush of people to get on the plane. I also pre-booked food. I saw the flight attendants bring food to several passengers around me but passed by me with the food cart. I had to call the flight attendant with the button and only after my boarding pass was inspected was my food served. The portion was inadequate to say the least. The bathroom was out of soap and when I again used the call button to get out of sight flight attendant's attention she explained that there had been many flight segments and that the soap had run out. No apology was offered although she did suggest I use the bathroom in the back. Trying to explain that the airplane should be serviced at every stop regardless of how many flight segments there are in a day was useless and she felt it was not her or the airline's fault that there was no soap. After about 45 minutes the entire flight crew went to the back of the plane and closed the curtain while they read the newspaper and chatted. No one was in the front of the aircraft until landing. The floor of the plane had bits of trash all about. The worst flight I have ever been on."
3604,Flew with Thai Air Asia from Yangon via Bangkok to Siem Reap and from Saigon via Bangkok back to Yangon. The only major problem was when we had to check in a bag (15kg) in Saigon for a whopping US$72. It was more than I paid for my ticket. Service not bad planes are clean and FAs are friendly. Bought food for US$6 - extremely small portion and not worth it.
3605,TLV-VNO (via RIX) and back end of July 2012. Hidden charges they add 5 euro when completing booking without notice on the early stages of reservation. They supply water on board only for payment of 2.50 euro per 75 ml bottle. The rest of the service is good. They should add these expenses to the ticket price to not make passengers angry.
3606,Vancouver - Calgary - Cuba again 3x3x3 but at least we had our individual screens so we could watch what we wanted. I went option plus which gives you priority boarding. Plus a comfort pack pillow blanket ear phones small bottle of champagne and a free snack. $70 more but you do get to board first and your luggage is off loaded first so for that reason I would recommend that. I will never take another flight that's not direct again. We were supposed to 'touch down' for 45 min in Calgary to pick up passengers. Took a little longer than I was told. I never got the comfort pack until after I left Calgary. I am a looking into different options for my next trip. If you are small you may be alright in the seats. The ride home for me was painful smaller plane couldn't sleep a wink. One big screen in the middle of the plane so staff got to pick the movies. I expected nothing from the food having flown with them before and I wasn't surprised some things I never even opened. They seem to be more interested in soliciting sales for duty free than I remembered from my last trip. In Cuba Option plus meant nothing you couldn't understand a thing the woman said. In summary I don't think any airline I've found has what you would call good food. I may give them another try if they get different planes my knees were in the back of the other passengers seat for over 6hrs.
3607,We booked a vacation from Edmonton AB Canada to Manzanillo Mexico on Air Transat in Feb 2014 - the first time we've ever flown with Air Transat. We then discovered that our flight was being operated by EnerJet an airline that Air Transat contracted out to. EnerJet had absolutely no in-flight entertainment on their planes and not even a power plug or USB for electronics which meant we had to go out and buy a rechargeable DVD player for the trip and load up on books etc. so that we weren't just sitting there for 5.5 hours with nothing to do. There were only 2 washrooms aboard the plane and we were at the very back of the plane the entire trip and there was a constant parade of people heading to the washrooms. The seats were very crowded also. The meal was quite good - chicken wraps and beef sandwiches with a little salad cheese crackers and a piece of fudge for dessert and the refreshments came by quite frequently which was nice.
3608,Honolulu to Auckland - very cramped seating - we are both tall - bit annoyed that there were empty rows with one person there yet others were cramped. Felt like a wreck when we landed after a brilliant holiday. Air New Zealand used to be a really good airline now it feels cheap. Next time I will choose a different airline. Food was awful entertainment poor.
3609,Me and my wife flew AirAsia X for the very first time ADL-KUL-CMB-KUL-ADL return via Male (Transit). The first two legs leg ADL-KUL was somewhat OK mainly because of the facilities as the ADL airport. The return trip was very unpleasant. All around the cabin crew were friendly and helpful but did not serve enough drinks even when the flight was delayed. We were deprived of basic needs-water while in transit in Male (before boarding). KUL AirAsia terminal is worst than a bus terminal. Filthy hot dirty cafes generally not suitable for any type of modern day air travel especially when passengers have to take long haul flights. Narrow seating and lack of leg space made it one of my worst air travel. Gone too far to reduce the cost by maximizing seat capacity which make long haul flights (ADL/CMB vv -7 hrs) very uncomfortable. Good budget concept but gone too far in compromising basic air travel needs of passengers to low cost.
3610,Chiang Mai to Krabi. This is by no means a budget carrier due to their increasing prices. They were the only carrier to offer a direct flight less than two hours (avoiding BKK) but at a cost of almost Â£300 one way for two people. Thai Bangkok and Nokair all stopped at Bangkok. Nothing given for free on board no entertainment. You got to pay for luggage and I couldn't fathom out how not to pay for their insurance! Better and cheaper fares offered with main airline carriers. Although the flight was straightforward.
3611,Air Asia at first glance looks like a great deal but beware! As stated by others on this site they consistently block you from checking in online and pre-paying your bags. So on a domestic flight from Phuket to Bangkok instead of $330 baht per bag (about $10-11 US per bag) we had to pay a whopping $900 per bag (about $30 US per bag!) and it was their fault that we couldn't follow their procedure to check-in and pre-pay online. If you are sick (like I was) on the flight don't expect an air sickness bag in the pocket at your seat nor a blanket you have to buy the blanket. The flight was chaotic! There were toddlers running up and down the aisles screaming the entire flight with the flight attendants allowing it never mind the danger to the children! In-flight entertainment? None. Spend the extra and fly a real airline.
3612,Stockholm - Riga - Kiev and back. Old Boeing airplanes on all legs fairly clean. Punctual but all flying times are overestimated on timetable. Staff professional but unfriendly and sometimes even rude. Ridiculous price for luggage! You may end up paying more than 50 euros for one piece of checked luggage. No information about this whatsoever prior to check in - very bad indeed. On the flights you have to pay for everything extra even a glass of water! Bearing in mind that Air Baltic tickets aren't especially cheap I cannot recommend this airline.
3613,"Winnipeg to Dominican Republic on Airbus 310. We booked in Option Plus so there was a special check-in line at both airports. Thank goodness because the regular check-in line at the Punta Cana airport had over 100 people in it! We got through the Option Plus check-in line in less than 10 minutes. Option Plus holders are also allowed to board the plane first so that was nice and we knew there would be space for our carry-on in the overhead compartments (which were huge anyway). Received free champagne a small wine bottle preferred meals and a snack as well as another free alcoholic drink. Seating arrangement was a little odd though. 3x3x3. Not very many people travel in a group of 3. The seats are very small though I'm only 5'5"" and it was tight for my body. I felt awful for my 6'0"" boyfriend who couldn't even put his tray table down flat. The tightness of the seats really put us in a bad mood and a lot of the others on the plane were getting cranky due to the lack of room too. The food wasn't bad it was edible at least. Instead of individual televisions there were only TV's in the middle and they were small and not very high quality. I don't know why they bother having televisions at all because people were just getting frustrated when others walked by to go to the washroom or stretch and caused them to ""miss"" parts of the movie. The only way I would travel with Air Transat again is if I was in a row of 2 (which there were few in the back and cost extra) or in club class. Do not travel in economy class with this company you will pull your hair out and it will ruin your vacation."
3614,Montreal to Paris on Airbus 310. The overall impression of this flight was bad. However lets start from positive side - check-in and boarding was ok with helpful ground staff. It should be highlighted that crew on board of the aircraft was friendly helpful professional and very skilled. The very negative side is that seats are extremely narrow and small. It is impossible to fit it. The plane A310 (very old model) was redesigned for configuration 3X3X3 (9 in total in a row instead of 7) which is really painful since 2 extra seats in each row are put in. NO TV individual screens. The food is just horrible and not eatable. NOT recommended for Paris-Montreal route and my advice is to double check the model of aircraft before booking. Avoid at any cost A310.
3615,"WLG-HLZ. Initial flight was cancelled received a phone call to advise of new flight details. Arrived at WLG to find that the new flight was delayed 20 minutes this increased to 1 hour. There is no web check in which is unbelievable for this day and age and the self-check-in at the airport simply said ""we cannot check you in please see a representative"". The queue for the manual check-in counter was huge at least 20 people waiting for the one single person manning the desks. In addition there were no empty seats within several minutes' walk of the departure gate and I was not given the particular seat on the plane I chose online. Awful - next time I'll drive."
3616,"I flew Hanoi to KL and then KL to Gold Coast return. Actually in the air Air Asia are just fine. They are a budget airline and they do exactly what they say they do nothing more and nothing less. If you do all your bookings online and select food etc. then it is okay. I took my own laptop with movies my own pillow and the in cabin service was fine. Their option of the ""quiet zone' - a cabin where no children under 12 are allowed - is just wonderful if you want some peace and quiet and don't want to put up with noisy kids and babies. Their on- ground service is not great but that is mainly because they are flying in and out of cheap airports with third- rate facilities and service. Optiontown is a complete waste of time and money. I paid for a chance at getting two spare seats next to me I never got them they notified me by email three hours after I left Hanoi and when I finally got my so-called 'automatic refund' I only got back 24 AUD from the original $56 USD."
3617,"My partner and I flew Air Asia to Malaysia on 26/12/13 and returned to Melbourne Australia on 5/01/2014. The flight was fine but you do get what you paid for. Which is no entertainment waiting for long periods of time in the departure lounges. Having to pay for everything from blankets to water to drinks to entertainment. I am extremely disappointed that Air Asia suggests ""Optiontown"" for possible upgrades to the beds or for ""spare seats"" next to you. I paid for both options for both flights in October (Months before we departed). We didn't receive the upgrades as the options were not available due to heavy bookings. Not impressed and wouldn't be suggesting Air Asia nor this Optiontown to anyone."
3618,MEL to KUL then onto Cebu and back to MEL then KUL to Cebu. A disaster at check in as the computer failed. Arrived at airport at 4.30am still standing in the same spot 2 hours later. Sent to the wrong boarding gate finally got on the plane and flight attendants very blasÃ© about the delay. MEL to KUL and back with very boring food. Check in at MEL airport took forever arrived at 10.30 pm for the flight didn't get through check in until midnight. After this experience never again.
3619,Flown from CCU-KUL (LCCT) and back. Comfortable flight. As with any low cost carrier you could buy food and drinks on board. The flight attendants were nice and friendly. Only down side was lack of inflight entertainment and poor leg room.
3620,"We flew FD2603 DMK-CSX on 16/09/14 and returned by FD FD2604 on 19/03/14. The DMK-CSX boarding was delayed because staff were not at the gate at departure time. We were informed that they had been busy with another gate and thus no staff were available for our gate. The boarding thus became messy although we managed to get through because of our priority boarding seat privilege. On the return flight our group consisted of 13 persons with 4 booking codes. We were told to check-in as a group and we were the first group to check in at the counter. Our queue however was overtaken by another tour group. We had to ""protest"" in order to have our queue maintained. Check-in was slow and rather inefficient and we were informed that it is because the staff are new. BTW the inflight services are OK on both legs. Web-ordered meals were reasonable. Finally when we arrived at DMK three of our luggage had lost the luggage tags. Fortunately there was not much baggage and we could identify them. But imagine if this were a connecting flight or several pieces of baggage was involved?"
3621,The worst airline in the world in terms of customer service. I booked a series of flights 8 months in advance. Air Asia moved one of the flights causing a connection to be not possible. Air Asia then refused to allow me to move the flights to fix the connection conflict they caused and refused to give me a refund. I wonder what happens if I take the flights and get stranded when one flight lands after the connection has already taken off?
3622,Expensive ticket Hamburg to Riga so I did not expect a low-budget-flight. Had to pay to check 1 piece of luggage (for each leg). Food in the cabin had to be paid for too! Never again.
3623,Flying from Vienna to Riga. Flight was 2 hrs long. The only inflight entertainment was a magazine the seat pitch and width was small. The flight attendants were bad the food and baggage was expensive as well.
3624,A good airline with good value for money. On the downside is their baggage rules 1 bag on a round trip costs approx ??0 - same as the airfare. Although they cooperate with SAS and recognises Eurobonus privileges this does not apply to baggage allowance. Ground staff and crew were fantastic.
3625,MEL-WLG. A320. Very little personal space on board. You actually start to pray that the person in front of you doesn't recline their seat. You try to eat your meal and even lifting your hand to your mouth feels like a mission. Not impressed with this at all. This airline is starting to forget about what made them successful - good service good facilities and loyal customers. After 20 years of flying with them I've had enough and will now use other airlines for across the tasman.
3626,NOU-SYD. Lacklustre crew with very few smiles. Food of mediocre quality for Business Class cabin too hot and not adjusted despite request. Not an experience to remember.
3627,SYD-NOU return. What a disappointment-after reading some of the good reviews I was looking forward to the trip. The check in at SYD was a disaster-4 economy desks with only one manned until they could find one more as the economy queue got longer and longer Also the outward journey was delayed by 45 minutes with little explanation . Once onboard the cabin crew were condescending if you spoke no French and the food was stale. The PTV was ok on the A330 but I returned on the A320 which only had limited audio. This flight was also late. There was hardly any legroom and to top it all off the bags didn't arrive at the carousel until at least 40 minutes later.
3628,SYD-NOU Economy A330. Wonderful flight and service - especially compared to Qantas on the way back! Great food. Lovely wine and digestif..
3629,SYD-NOU: We departed with an hour's delay and arrived late not too bad though. The plane was super very new and very clean the staff attentive and the food great. It was a very French experience their English could be improved.
3630,Flew Phuket to Chiang Mai and got dinged nearly $60 CAD ($55 US) for a 20 kg bag. When I picked myself up off the floor I asked the desk person if I could avoid this sticker shock on my return flight. Told to go to the website check in online and 'pre-register' my bag online. The savings would be 'significant'. So today I did just that. Only problem - when it came to registering the bag the website froze me out - even after multiple attempts. Simply couldn't register the bag let alone pay a lower fee for it. When we got to the airport I explained the situation. We had checked in online so it was clear I wasn't pulling anyone's leg about trying to get things done on the website. But the check in person gave me the cow in a pasture stare and charged me full freight for the bag again. I explained again it wasn't my fault - I'd tried to do what her colleague had recommended - but their website wasn't working. I then told my story to the person who took my money. Same look. So watch out! Bag charges are exorbitant and going online to lessen the charge brings no joy.
3631,KL to Kota Kinabalu. I was hoping for a more Malaysian style welcome however I was not even shown to my seats. The cabin crew were fixing their hair and make up and chatting. I was not offended but in my 18 years of flying I have never seen such sight.
3632,"Round trip Tel Aviv to Riga. B737 both ways both flights red eyes which is great for connections in Riga but terrible for the body. All leather seats leg room tight. Crew very polite. All the rest is ""buy onboard"". Not even water. I paid 500 euro for this flight so by no mean a low cost ticket and not being served a thing onboard felt like LCC taken to extreme. Ground staff in Riga polite and helpful. Will fly again as they are the only ones going non-stop to Riga but not looking forward for the experience."
3633,Had to pay for luggage although was not informed by my agent about this extra cost (almost everyone in the check in queue had a similar unpleasant surprise feeling). Seats were old with a large pitch. Charging people for drinks on-board made the service slow and annoying. Tickets were pricey. Will never fly with them again.
3634,Paris-Montreal. I had mixed impressions: The positive side is that Terminal 3 in CDG airport is very pleasant to use check-in staff are very competent and the security area was moving quickly. Boarding was done using buses but very well organized by the ground staff. Inflight attendants were very helpful throughout the flight. The negative side is that seats are so narrow that you cannot move a finger. The plane A330 was redesigned for configuration 3X3X3 (9 in total in a row instead of 8) which is extremely uncomfortable. It is just impossible to seat 7 hours without any changes in a position. The food is just horrible. My advice is to bring my own meal. The comfort kits costs 9 Canadian dollars which includes pillow blanket etc. This is definitely the low cost airline and overall it is an average experience. I will report about the return flight as well.
3635,Perth to Bali. A320. Booked hot seats row 1. Meal included but we weren't priority boarded as the website indicated. Crew friendly and helpful. Flight slight turbulence but arrived on time. New plane. Only hiccup was online check in with no luggage says we can go straight to departure gate but lucky we checked as you still need to go to web check in desk to reprint boarding pass. Plus many passengers in the wrong line up. One row for online web check and one not. Ground staff didn't appear interested that all passengers queuing all in one line. Signage was poorly indicating.
3636,Air Asia Indonesia. QZ8322 21 Mar 2014 DMK-CGK (A320). Website check-in is convenient check-in agents are good and smiling and oblige if you want to change to an Aisle seat. Boarding in DMK is Manual and the staff check recheck and re- recheck if you have boarded or not. Crew welcoming and point to your seat. Announcements so fast no one can understand them. Safety demonstrations are very good and clear to the point. Food looks like it has been recycled on 2 or more flights I had pre-booked meal (Pak Nassers Nasi Lemak) as I'm allergic to fish however the meal included Anchovies. Again on landing the announcements were so fast that we all just looked at each other in a daze. Overall I will fly them again but will bring my own food and water.
3637,Air Asia Indonesia. QZ8320 23 Mar 2014 CGK-DMK (A320). Website check-in is convenient CGK check-in agents are good and smiling and oblige if you want to change to an Aisle seat. Boarding in CGK is utter chaos and staff are in Go away Go away mode. Again Crew welcoming and point to your seat (the Weekend uniform is extremely untidy it kills the image). Announcements again so fast. Safety demonstrations are very good and clear to the point. Food again looks like it has been recycled 2 or more flights I had pre-booked meal (Satay with Asian Fried rice). Again no information that it contained Shrimp paste (I'm allergic to Seafood). On landing the announcements were so fast. Overall I will fly them again but as I said in my previous comment will bring my own food and water.
3638,We travelled to Manzanillo from Saskatoon Jan 7 2014. We could not believe there was no inflight entertainment not even music. We never did get a reasonable explanation to why.
3639,Friday 7th June. Melbourne to Christchurch. Paid for the seat only and took on hand luggage. Seat comfort is reasonable but it feels like you are sitting in a sardine can. Luckily the person in front of me didn't recline their seat for the 3.5 hour trip. FA's friendly and did frequent water runs. Was greeted by name as I boarded the flight.
3640,Travelling with small children is always stressful no matter how prepared you are but I have to say that the staff on all our flights were excellent. Very accommodating helpful and great with the kids. The staff were always at hand and went beyond their duty providing 'peep-bo' entertainment for my two. We travelled from Sydney to Kula Lumpur which is a long way with little ones. My advice would be to take your own snacks for the kids and make sure you book your in-flight extras like hot food and the tablet as the older planes do not have built-in screens. Highly recommend with small children.
3641,"Air Asia D7316 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing March 12-13. We have flown on airlines throughout the world and have never been on a worse airline in 50 years of flying. Kuala Lumpur airport is awful. When you ask if there are meals provided they say ""yes"" but don't tell you that you are required to pay extra. If you have cashed in your money because you are flying into another country you are out of luck. We were 6 hours without a coffee water or tea. When we asked for a complimentary coffee the flight attendant said ""No we are a low cost airline"". They nickel and dime you all the way. When you check in they ask if you would like to check your bag. Then hit you with a $30 charge! However they let all kinds of over-sized bags on the plane so getting to your seat is total chaos. Loading the plane is a joke. It is basically a stampede to the plane out on the tarmac it is a total free for all on the tarmac."
3642,MUC-RIX-AMS. Web check-in didn't work had to pay extra for luggage. Onboard crew ok but seats were poor and the seat pitch was the worst I have seen! Flights were on time but in general not to recommend.
3643,First airline where I had to pay for coffee. This type of customer service takes more time to process the payment then it would to provide the coffee or water for free. Getting e-tickets online was nil.
3644,I paid the extra cost to select seats in the Emergency Exit row to have the extra legroom. Air Baltic changed the aircraft to one with a different Emergency Exit row and did not change my seat reservations. Other passengers then secured the Emergency Exit rows seats meaning I paid the extra cost for nothing and had to have standard seats. Very poor service by Air Baltic to take your money and fail to provide what you paid for.
3645,LGW-RIX-LGW. Outbound leg was 2 hrs delayed the reason was not explained. Cabin attendants were obviously tired and unfriendly they ignored me when I wanted to buy a snack!
3646,"I have flown this airline a couple of times now and it just keeps getting worse. They call themselves ""The world's best leisure airline"" however the cramped seating/aircraft does not reflect this at all. In addition staff are indifferent and unhelpful. During one long flight when our monitors didn't work they couldn't have cared less. 7 hours staring at the seat in front of me. In the last instance they lost my bag that I had paid an extra $100 for it arrived at my residence 3 days later."
3647,After booking a flight from Christchurch to London via Hong Kong last year and being a long term Koru member we received what I can only describe as very 3rd class attention. Our flight from Hong Kong to London was cancelled after ANZ dropped this route as being unprofitable prior to March this year (travelled in May). We had to make other arrangements as LA was not an option for us. The alternative offered was Cathay Pacific who provided a truly super service. However one of the reasons my wife and I choose ANZ internationally was to be able to use the lounge facilities in Hong Kong going out and in London Heathrow and Hong Kong returning. It just makes the 22 hour flight more bearable. However during the dropping of the London - Hong Kong sector ANZ have made no alternative lounge facilities through any other airline and the code share at Hong Kong does not allow a guest since March this year. I understand the need to rationalise flight sectors but the poor way ANZ staff handled the change in my case is very disappointing and not worthy of a so called 4 star airline. Our Next international flights will be with another carrier some who offer complimentary lounge facilities and a genuine customer care attitude as a given.
3648,KUL(LCC)-ICN A330. As you would expect with Air Asia cheap and cheerful with no frills. Surprisingly the leg room on this flight (overnight) was quite good and I was able to sleep quite well.
3649,REP-KUL. I must say that fares aren't that much cheaper than full service airlines if you only book a few weeks in advance. There are a lot of additional fees some of which are not avoidable. If you have to change your flight you will get clobbered. Check-in was another problem. Their website says that international check-in opens 3 hours before the flight - not true. The check-in did not open until 2 hours before. Once it did the queue did move at a painfully slow pace. The agent seem to have problems with every person checking in and had to call the supervisor over more than once for every passenger. I'd checked in online but not printed my boarding pass (as I had a mobile one sent to my mobile). This caused a lot of problems and needed the supervisor. Once through security everything was a breeze. Organised boarding great cabin crew clean plane comfortable seats and good food. I'd check to see how much you're actually saving before using Air Asia. If its enough then book it.
3650,Have flown with AA a few times this time RT from CNX to PEN. On the way from CNX to PEN I had to pay for the first checked baggage twice just because I had a transit in Kuala Lumpur. You will never know where they are going to put you in the airplane unless you pay to choose seat.
3651,WAW-RIX-TBS flights from Warsaw to Riga - very old small Fokkers. Riga to Tbilisi quite nice Boeing with comfortable seats. Only food available onboard is to purchase and luggage has to be paid for. The worst thing was the cancellation of two of my flights. Unkind cabin crew and unpleasant staff at the airport in Riga.
3652,Aircraft was clean and inflight team efficient and friendly. I recognise this airline offers stripped down fares and charges for luggage and seats etc normally provided free by other carriers. In view of this it is essential to get the management of providing these extras under control and that is not what I found. Having reserved a seat online and booking priority check-in at the airport my booking was not on the system and the seat not available. On the return no priority check-in available so I queued. The worst thing was that my complaint was badly handled and I was pointed to the small print in the Conditions of Carriage saying seat reservations don't definitely reserve you a seat and Priority Check-in is not refundable. Travelling is difficult enough without this type of response from carriers. Such a pity.
3653,Manchester to Toronto on 23rd Dec flew club class and the flight and service was fine. However the flight home on 5th Jan was another matter. Tried to upgrade weeks earlier and was told it was full so check on the day asked at check in and was told it was $250 and that 2 people has cancelled but you had to ask when boarding and pay then so at the gate we asked again only to be told it was $360 and again you had to pay on the plane upon boarding the plane we mentioned we would like to upgrade and were told it was $460! I told the steward that this was the 3rd different price and he said that he wasn't prepared to haggle like a market trader! Couldn't believe my ears. Due to snow we then sat on the plane for 3 hours before take off which is no ones fault however in all that time the seat belt signs stayed on and no one was allowed to visit the toilet so when we finally take off and get to the right altitude virtually the whole plane is stud waiting for the loo which means food or drinks can't be served for about 1hr30 min. Flight out excellent flight home nightmare.
3654,Manzanillo (Mexico) to Calgary (Canada) flight TS3521 on Dec 22 2013. Wanted to complain on the way passenger boarding was handled by Air Transat staff at Manzanillo airport which resulted in many young kids being separated from their parents. There was one general queue with four counters serving passengers. Then staff announced that there was a separate queue line for passengers with young kids. We and many other families moved to this queue thinking it would be faster. The problem was that the generic queue was serviced by three counters but there was only one counter serving the family queue! Moreover the only person serving the family queue had one arm in a plaster cast and was able to type in with one arm only. As a result the general queue with three counters available to them moved much faster and were all done by the time many families in the other queue were still waiting in the line. The general queue passengers got all the adjacent seats and by the time the families were allowed to reach the check-in counter the only seats left were single ones dispersed all over the cabin! Many young kids (including ours) got seats separate from their parents. When I pleaded with the counter person to find at least two adjacent seats for my youngest to be able to sit with the mom the reply was that there was nothing available and we should ask the passengers on the plane to volunteer and give us their seats. On the plane the stewardesses were able to help some (but not all) of the families by negotiating with the other passenger to swap seats. I think the above was result of a poor administration of the boarding at the airport. Had the airport staff allowed all the families with young kids to check in first before the rest of the passengers this could have been avoided.
3655,A very disappointing experience AKL-SFO. At check in they tried to seat our party of two in different rows (eventually rectified). Got onboard the ancient 747 to find that half the archaic IFE (which had very limited options as it was) wasn't working so they had to reboot system (a long drawn out procedure). Slow disorganised service from the crew - very mixed bag with some putting in the effort and others completely uninterested and even rude at times when requesting things such as tissues. Disgusting meal (first choice ran out in 7 rows) and missed for drink services twice by the Flight Services Manager! All in all big let down and would reconsider paying the premium to fly on Air New Zealand for these long flights again.
3656,"SYD-AKL-LAX. Smooth flight from Sydney to Auckland. The flight was a little delayed in boarding at Sydney because the plane arrived late but still managed to keep me on schedule for my flight to LAX as I had a decent layover. Lunch served from SYD-AKL was actually pretty good and quite tasty for airplane food. Dinner served from AKL-LAX was not so good and took forever because I was at the very back of the plane. The service was ok but not amazing and some of the flight attendants were a bit cold. When boarding the plane I had no one on hand to assist me in storing my bag in the overhead compartment and I could have done with the assistance as I'm only 5'2"". In-flight entertainment was good and had a large selection. Seating was comfy and had ample leg room. Overall I wouldn't mind flying with them again."
3657,Flight AK 1967 6th September 2013 seat 21D Krabi to Kuala Lumpur. Most unpleasant and unhappy flight attendants I have flown with. Seat extremely cramped. Movement between arrival/departure lounges and plane very poorly organised. My wife and I in separate rows despite checking in together! I would be extremely reluctant to fly Air Asia again.
3658,"We flew Air Asia twice during our trip to SE Asia. I found the process of check-in well organized and tolerable. A low cost airline is going to have large crowds to manage and they did a good job. The seats are tight but no worse than more expensive airlines. Ads are tedious but I am sure these keep the cost down. All in all a satisfactory experience. They got us where we wanted to go efficiently and on schedule. Isn't that what a ""Now everybody can fly"" airline supposed to do?"
3659,While at Singapore Changi Airport it took me more than 2.5 hrs to queue just to check in. The AirAsia counters were grossly under staffed with 2 to 3 staff members frantically trying to process up to 4 or 5 flights of passengers. There was not enough staff to manage the queue many passengers were fed up and started queue jumping. Many passengers were late to board the plane not to mention time to shop the DFS stores. My flight to Bali took off an hour late. Worst experience I had with a budget airline.
3660,Kuala Lumpur to Manila. Pre flight customer service was a nightmare. My flight was delayed before my trip I was sent an SMS to be advised of this. I was offered an earlier flight that wasn't going to work because I was travelling from Adelaide at that time. There were no changes made and they acknowledged there was no change. When I arrived in KL to check in they inform me my flight was changed to the earlier flight. There was a lot of hassle and waiting but I was provided with my boarding pass. Flight was good aircraft could do with some updating but the flight was half empty which meant flat bed. Check in gave me a hot seat without paying for it. As soon as seat belt sign was off I went to sleep staff left me alone and it was all good. Cant comment on food or how the service was but as far as I am concerned in the air I got what I wanted. The selection of food is quite bland I would prefer to just take my food on board. For the price it was not bad. When it comes to Staff service I have based it on the pre customer service as that's where I experienced most of the customer service.
3661,Amsterdam-Riga-Amsterdam. This was the last leg of intercontinental flight. All went smoothly however got a feeling of very impersonal service from AB. I also faced some level of check-in staff incompetence in Riga airport ??my checked in luggage on the way back to Sydney was forwarded to Malaysia only ??not to my final destination. According to them that was the only option they can do despite my KLM multi-leg ticket. I had to cross Malaysian border control just to collect my bag check it in again and come back into departure area for the flight to SYD. Fortunately this was the only odd thing I experienced.
3662,TXL-RIX-VNO return. All flights punctual. Flight attendants were friendly pilots kept us updated. However any full-fare airline that charges for drinks and baggage can only receive a mediocre rating. It should be a gesture of courtesy to offer paying customers at least a glass of water or a hot drink in winter.
3663,IST-RIX. RIX-LED. While boarding was a bit chaotic both flights on time and our bags were among the first off the plane. Each was only a relatively short flight so the lack of inflight entertainment / food didn't really bother me. The flight attendants seemed friendly enough. The interiors of the planes looked quite new and the seats were quite comfortable.
3664,Returned from Punta Cana yesterday. Plane itself was fine. Updated with nice lighting etc. Movies and shows/entertainment is all pretty outdated. Flight was smooth. Food there and back was not good. My biggest concern is the flight staff. Very inconsistent (some rows get wet towels before meals some don't etc). The speed with which their service is delivered is poor. My side had food drink wet wipe while my daughters side had none of those things. The food eventually was delivered about 10 minutes later. Another concern is that the attendants are quite a bit older and put respectfully not in great shape to be pushing a cart up and down narrow aisles. The airport at Punta Cana was ridiculous - there were at least 6 huge planes leaving within about 30 minutes of each other. It took over 3 hours from the arrival time to drop off luggage and get through screening and security with thousands of other travellers. Surely this could be controlled with better logistics.
3665,My wife suffers with COPD so we paid the premium for club class bad idea the seating arrangements had changed since our last trip and they were uncomfortable. My headrest was continually being pushed down as it did not lock in place by people coming by to use the washroom. The food was not the greatest and my wife was becoming agitated with her discomfort. I would not pay the premium again! I am surprised by lack of concern. After three previous return flights to Britain that had been so good.
3666,AKL to HKG. 772. Midnight flight. Very strange that all cabin crews in economy class were all Asian males. Services were good nice and friendly. After the meal went straight to sleep. Have to say the seat was not bad at all. Managed to get some sleep. Landing was super.
3667,First time with Air New Zealand on a short hop from Wellington to Auckland. Old B733 but well maintained and with comfortable seating. Loved the safety video. Smart looking crew very efficiently managed to serve a drink (coffee tea water) and a snack during this short domestic flight. Ground staff made me check-in my carry-on as it was 1 kg over the weight limit. Wish they would enforce this with all travellers as other passengers brought large pieces of luggage on board. Flight about double the price than Jetstar on same route and as a QF Platinum will give my business to Jetstar in the future. This one time NZ booking was done due to flight times as I needed to catch an international flight from Auckland.
3668,Kota Kinabalu Malaysia to Jakarta Indonesia. Value for money. No inflight entertainment. Food needs to be paid for with cash onboard. Terrible option for food. Seat is disaster. Nice airline to take for short distances due to economy value. Future travel will avoid this airline. Prefer Malaysia Airline.
3669,Delayed more than 3 hours on flight to Bali from Kuala Lumpur on 9 Jan 2014. Although the ground staff knew about the delay in advance they failed to inform the passengers early - not only were we not informed at check in counter but only 1 hour prior scheduled take off time when we were at the gate. The airline changed the flight number causing great confusion and inconvenience for all passengers. No embarkation cards were also given out on board which is a normal procedure with all airlines. Air Asia maybe a budget airline but this does not give it a right to do what they want and as they please. Terrible experience.
3670,RIX-CDG. There is no free inflight entertainment system for economy class not even overhead screens on Boeing 737 Classic. Only system which is provided is a iPad+headphones for a fee. There is no free inflight catering too. Hot meals from buy-on-board magazine were not provided for the last 12 rows 12 because they didn't have more then 2 portions of each meal type. There is no free beverages. Not even a glass of water. There is no free pillow and blanket only for lease for whole flight. Quality isn't worth for price of the tickets.
3671,RIX-SVG. There were a lot of flight crew members ready to help you but not too friendly. They should learn how to smile. I had a smooth flight given that the weather was stormy. They didn't give us a meal or drink but it was a short flight.
3672,My husband and I recently flew from LGW (London Gatwick) to YYZ (Toronto Pearson) in economy class. The flight left on time at 9.35am UTC and arrived at 12.45pm EST in Toronto. The flight was about 8 hours and ten minutes long. Everything was very smooth with just a few minutes of mild turbulence as we were landing. The movies were ok - a lot of international film festival movies. We were lucky to fly on one of the updated planes with the modern entertainment units on each seat. I have flown Air Transat overseas several times and I find the eastbound journey is usually the older planes as most people sleep during the overnight flight. The eastbound journey is with the updated planes as most people are away for the midday flight. The food is pretty awful but what can you expect for economy rates? My husband did get food poisoning when we were flying to Europe so from now on we only eat their vegetarian meals if at all possible. Constant queue for toilets but what can you expect with over 300 people on a plane? Overall they were enjoyable flights and we would fly with them again. Excellent value for your money.
3673,Flew from Gatwick to Vancouver. Paid for a seat and got about 3/4 because the person in the middle was so large. Food horrible. Of course the crew started at the front of the plane and because there was some turbulence they had to stop serving for 10 minutes and return to the back galley so when they continued and got to the rear it was also cold.
3674,Had another wonderful flight from Whitehorse to Vancouver. Disappointed that's had to transit via Kelowna however. Makes a relatively short flight into a long one. I was also very disappointed in the agent boarding the aircraft. Very rude and poorly trained. First denied me boarding for invalid ID that's had used to board the Air North flight from Vancouver to Whitehorse. Another agent had to inform her my ID was valid and acceptable for travel. The flight attendants however were very attentive and defiantly made up for it all.
3675,Flew YVR-YXY-YVR. Flights both left on time and were pleasant and smooth. Flight Attendants were very friendly and helpful throughout the flight.
3676,AirAsia failed to get me CGK-JKT on Christmas Eve. All they offered was flight to Sydney and Melbourne - and make your own way there. Couldn't offer me a direct flight for 48 hours from KUL although MAS had spare seats.
3677,We travelled from Singapore to Krabi by Airasia Thailand on 29th December 2013. I have to say that I am not pleased with the punctuality of the airline. We were delayed as the flight arrived 20 minutes late from Krabi. Delayed again on the way back to Singapore. However the flight was smooth and seats were comfortable for a low cost carrier. A strange incident happened as we were approaching the terminal in Singapore. We were all ready to leave the aircraft when the pilot announced that we would push back to another gate. The process itself took another 30 minutes. So overall we were delayed by over an hour. But still the flight was very smooth and good.
3678,"Air Asia Indonesia. KUL-CGK on 12/26 and CGK-SIN on 12/30. Both flights experienced delays. The first was due to arriving aircraft (two hours) and the second was due to ATC in SIN (boarded on time but one hour delay on the plane). The seats were comfortable for the short flights. The legroom was also adequate. I'm 5'11"" (180 cm) and I had a small amount of space in between my knees and the seat in front of me. That being said for a long flight three hours plus it would get a bit tiring. I pre-ordered a meal which tasted fine. Unfortunately it was on a flight that was delayed for two hours and departed after Midnight and I had already eaten the same meal unknowingly twice before. Definitely wasn't in the mood. The price is cheap sure but expect a two hour delay every time which means lots of waiting. For our flight KUL-CGK there was no announcement of any delay until after the scheduled departure time (but they kept making announcements for other delays). Bring your patience for sure."
3679,VIE-RIX RIX-HEL Not good value for money you have to pay 20 eur for hold baggage and you only discover this at the end of the online booking process. Zero tolerance regarding weight limits for both hold and hand luggage. Web- check-in did not work. If I pay almost 200 eur one way I expect to get at least a glass of water and or a coffee for free or at least for a reasonable price. Slow check-in at Riga even if you do it on your own at the machine you have to join the same long line in front of the counters to drop your baggage - total nonsense. Not very friendly staff in Riga cabin crew okay. Planes quite clean.
3680,I have flown with Air New Zealand for several years and have always found their service wonderful. That was not the case with my last flight to Hawaii. I felt like a number and some people received food and some did not. In my case my husband did and I didn't because of a new system of paying for food and even a drink of juice. For an international flight I think this is a terrible system which lead to a great deal of confusion and uncomfortableness for both the passengers and the flight crew. The different food services caused me to feel uncared for and undervalued as a customer.
3681,KUL to PER. Staff as we were leaving to go up the steps to board the aircraft were all checking their phones staff just seem to be getting slacker and slacker. The flight was a shambles service was so slow getting the meals out that we were too tired and just wanted to sleep. Cabin was boiling hot just absolutely stifling. Everything about Air Asia is going downhill I have been flying with them for years with 10+ flights a year and it is getting worse. Now that Malaysia Airlines are dropping their prices I am switching to them.
3682,Melbourne to KL on the overnighter. Left and arrived on time. Big problem these days with Air Asia X after many years of complaints is that the cabin was far too cold now it's far too hot. As the full plane was loading one could feel how stifling and hot it was. This didn't improve during the flight in fact many blankets pre-purchased were not even taken out of the plastic bag. Other issue were the flight attendants. Sure its the overnighter but we rarely saw them in Economy. Arrived in KL feeling cooked from an oven. The seats are just ok but would have been more comfortable if passengers were not sweating into the seats.
3683,I have to put in some severe criticism of Airnorth's customer service during the ash cloud disruption in June. My original morning flight on Sat 31 May Dili-Darwin was cancelled - fair enough. Airport staff thought it might operate in the afternoon and sent us home. The call centre told about midday that they hadn't decided what to do yet but would contact everyone later. About 3pm I got a call from the Qantas call centre to reschedule connecting flights and they saw in the system that Airnorth had rebooked me for 5pm Sunday. Then on Sunday morning I looked at Airnorth's website and it said that my 5pm flight had been changed to 12.45pm so I rushed off to the airport. It turned that was wrong and we were sent home. The call centre isn't open on Sundays so I had no idea what was happening. Eventually I saw on Darwin airport's website that the incoming fight had been cancelled (all other airlines operated normally from Dili and Darwin that afternoon). Airnorth eventually called at 7pm to tell me I was rescheduled for 5pm Monday. Normally Airnorth flights have been fine - on time good staff limited food but only short flights anyway. However they really can't handle anything unusual and given their monopoly on many routes they probably won't bother to improve.
3684,"Darwin to Kununurra in an E-170. Comfortable 2-abreast seating and a smooth flight. However there was a confusing beginning in Darwin as the departures screen said ""go to gate"" but did not give a gate number! Eventually a barely audible ""last call"" announcement was made. The service on-board was friendly. A pack of two small muffins and orange juice was served. The flight operated on time."
3685,DWN-TSV then GCA-DWN - April 2014. Flight down was direct on time and with good inflight service. Return flight via MT ISA less pleasing mainly because the FA's jammed us all together despite a number of rows of empty seats at the front of the plane. I hate having to ask to move once seated and with carry on in the o/head lockers. There was no need (that I can see) to stack us that way and it just left a bad taste in the mouth. Food on the return flights was similarly 'bad' in the mouth. 1st leg was a beef curry (very boarding school type muck) and 2nd leg described as a chicken wrap which turned out to be a beef wrap. Too bad if you were allergic and took a bite (surprise!).
3686,Airasia Indonesia. SUB-CGK. Overall the trip was good. The cabin crews were polite. But the staff service wasn't very good when I entered the boarding gate the staff hasn't placed the airport tax thing behind the boarding pass although we had paid to her. Because of that we should wait for minutes before boarding the aircraft.
3687,"I flew to Singapore from Sydney with Air Asia last week. I regret flying with AA. Pre-ordered meals were of very poor quality. There was a only very limited selection of food available for purchase - only peanuts chocolates and fizzy drinks. The flight was freezing cold and I had to pay money to rent a basic blanket. No credit cards are accepted on board. If you pay in dollars balance is paid in MYR- another rip off! There were 2 small children about 10 and 12 years travelling with their parents who changed their seats and moved near to a window just before we landed in KL to get a aerial view of KL. Many hot seats were unoccupied and were vacant throughout the flight and there was at most 20 min flight time left. The children were asked to return to their original seats by the flight attendant as they were not entitled to sit in ""hot"" seats. I thought the way they said was quite rude. The flight attendants speak little English. They are careless. I think what they sell as business class is probably as comfortable as Qantas Economy."
3688,Very unfriendly ground staff at Vilnius airport. I booked my ticket and paid at Tallinn office no mention of hand baggage rules either from the employee or printed on my ticket. I checked in and was told me I could take my hand baggage as carry on. No problem at the gate no problem at transfer gate in Riga to Vilnius. But at Vilnius airport with same hand baggage on my way back to Helsinki via Riga I was harassed by a young lady until I paid 60 Euros to check in my hand baggage because it was 12 kg instead of 8.9 kg. For a 276 Euros ticket Tallinn- Vilnius-Helsinki it's really unpleasant the flight was not full the overhead lockers were empty above my seat. As I did not speak Lithuanian I had less chance than other passengers that were allowed to bring their 13 kg baggage as carry on.
3689,September 16 2013 my husband daughter and I flew from Athens to Toronto. Unfortunately when we fastened our seats belts and were ready to depart our captain mentioned that we would be stopping in Paris to get more fuel. I do not understand how a direct flight includes a stop to get gas. Secondly customers should be warned beforehand because we would have booked another flight if we had known about this stop. We arrived to Paris at 3.45pm making it a 3 hour flight with an hour late departure from Athens. Told we would be leaving shortly but unfortunately an hour wait turned into a 6 hour wait. During this time we were told by a crew member that something was wrong with our engine and we would have to wait and see if it could be fixed or not. The way we were all treated was unacceptable! We stayed onboard for 6 hours we were not given water or food during this wait. We understand that safety is first and that mechanics were working on our plane but no one thought of the passengers. After 6 hours the captain told us that there was a computer problem and it had been reset but then we were told that because of our crew we had to stop again in Newfoundland. After 13 hours on that plane we were fed with a meal. We constantly asked for water and were told that the crew would be coming around for everyone and after waiting an hour no water was given. In the end we will never fly with Air Transat again and we would not recommend Air Transat. Our 8 hour flight turned into a 20 hour flight.
3690,Leg room on Internal flights is getting smaller and smaller. Being 6ft 2 inches or 1.88 mtrs it's a real squeeze to get into the seat. I feel sorry for anyone taller than me. Stop treating passengers like sardines. The trip I did was Auckland to Dunedin return. Both on an A380 and a Boeing.
3691,"Adelaide to Auckland April 28 2013. Usual incredibly strict control of baggage weight both hold and hand. Sure there need to be some controls but the pettiness of Air NZ on even one kilo over is incredibly frustrating especially after travelling long haul with a greater allowance. Given this is a one class only route there really ought to be better facilities and service. Food on board fine; service OK and typically informal/casual kiwi style including the Purser starting her announcement with ""hello lovely people"". Can't quite imagine that from one of the BA matrons!"
3692,B747-400 Premium Economy SFO-AKL B767 Works AKL-SYD. Pretty disappointed with the NZ service offering. Old Premium Economy seat had lots of recline but the legrest didn't extend upwards enough so it was essentially useless. Entertainment had a decent selection but the system was slow and not very responsive. Food was fine although some passengers were served using porcelain mugs while others given paper cups for drinks service which was odd. Inflight service was very inconsistent some smiling while others looked like they wanted to be elsewhere. Definitely not worth it if you paid full fare for Premium Economy. B767 was old although updated with AVOD. Breakfast was basic either continental or hot.
3693,TSV-DRW-TSV: We chose to fly with Air North because of good connection flight times when returning from our overseas holiday. We arrived in Darwin at 4.50am after being in transit for 12 hrs from an overseas destination we were scheduled to fly back to Townsville on the 7.00am flight which was perfect. Air North changed the flight schedule our new departure time was 1.45pm. An increased wait of 6.45 hours at Darwin airport. I contacted Air North and inquired if any assistance could be given to us meal voucher half day accommodation etc. I received an email from the Marketing and Communications Manager who sighted their rules of carriage and provided us with details of a local motel for us to contact no assistance was offered not even a coffee voucher! We were very disappointed in Air Norths lack of customer care and would not recommend using Air North especially when connecting to/from International flights.
3694,It isn't low cost there are additions to the fares such as seat selection fee baggage fee meal fee and other hidden fees which all adds to and cost as near as a decent airlines like Thai Airways. Their services from ground to in-flight staff were inefficient. KOL-HKT 5 of us were travelling including my 2 year old daughter. Bangkok- Phuket being a short haul flight I skipped the seat selection (my biggest mistake). I told the lady at the check- in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. All 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. Upon boarding I wasn't going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. A stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. I saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. The seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. Air Asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. Our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.They claimed that they did try to contact me. At the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. There were so we rushed to check-in luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. We had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. We struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time I had pre-selected seats with the original flight. We also had pre-booked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldn't serve us any meal. Air Asia in Bangkok lands at Don Muang Airport and not the Suvarnabhumi. The difference in two is that the Don Muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one. Everyone goes on a holiday to have a good time. Your holiday starts from the moment you are in the aircraft. Go for that little extra spending and choose a renowned airline.
3695,Flew from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur and then KL to Melbourne. Check-in online simply didn't work for us using any type of computer. Was also unable to manage my booking as system never allowed us to log in. Check in at Bangkok airport horrendous. Had to argue with check in agent to change seats so both of us were seated together (something we attempted numerous times online). Book with realistic expectations as that's all you will receive. Make sure you're at the gate in plenty of time as the gate suddenly closes with no announcements.
3696,Very unfriendly ground staff in Vilnius airport. Hand baggage rules are followed up to harassment. Constant delays and not very cheap if not booked early.
3697,I have flown with them several times. Far the biggest problem is changing schedule they have the right to cancel your flight up to 2 months before flight after that they have to find a replacement flight. Well 2 months ahead you don't really find any flights which are less than 2 times expensive than the original booking. Beware of baggage restrictions they check this without any tolerance. Food onboard is below every expectations and should be avoided. The plus part is well maintained and clean planes fast connection good space on Q400 and 757 the rest are ok. Forget about changing any tickets additional services and insurance the cheapest way always with them is cancellation. If you plan your trip well ahead it's worth it. If you go for comfort and stability its not your choice.
3698,Good trick to make money for Air Transat we flew from Toronto to Barcelona while seated before taking off the air conditioner was on full blast. Later on flight attendants came out to sell blankets for $9.00 each and you get to keep this blanket. This is the first time I experienced this advice to all flying Air Transat to have a sweater or jacket at hand before boarding. Other than that the flight was smooth and service was satisfactory.
3699,I have been flying with Air New Zealand since 2007 primarily Premier Economy or Business. The tickets are corporate and were not bought by me. The routes flown have been both via Hong Kong and Los Angeles. Had I been given the choice I would not have flown with this airline. In general the cabin staff have been friendly and efficient but inconsistent in their service delivery. Some teams have decided to deliver the bistro experience; others have gone along with the norm. On one occasion I witnessed one of the flight deck crew talking to a passenger who was concerned about something on the aircraft. Instead of reassuring the passenger he began shouting and threatened to call security to lift the passenger from the flight. Instead of defusing the situation he drew attention to the situation causing the passenger and his family to be acutely embarrassed. Joining their loyalty scheme through Star Alliance is pointless as the Air NZ routes have become limited as they no longer go via Honk Kong. In addition although I qualified as a Gold Member this was not updated on their system and I couldn?™t use their lounges or associated benefits. However the card had been issued and was at home waiting for me. A colleague has had similar experiences and written to Air NZ to complain. More than a month late he still has had the courtesy of a reply. You could put all this down to the Kiwi independence and a refusal to be subservient. However they are in the service industry and if they can?™t handle it then they shouldn?™t have joined. If you do travel with them you?™re unlikely to suffer unduly and you shouldn?™t let these things colour you impression of New Zealand.
3700,DPS-DRW on Embraer E170. This is a great little airline and a great little plane. Comfy seats with plenty of legroom free alcoholic drinks and a hot snack. They even served double drinks which is something I hadn't encountered in economy in a long time. Meal was a choice of hot meat or chicken pie plus cheese and crackers and a Twix. Service very friendly. Being such a small plane getting through immigration in Darwin was a breeze and the luggage was already on the belt when I got there. Customs was also easy. Unfortunately Airnorth are ceasing operations this route at the end of January 2009.
3701,Flight from Guangzhou to Kuala Lumpur. All of their service is what the low cost airlines have. Normal seat without IFE without food serving. Recommend during great promotion and travel with only cabin baggage (quite expensive check-in baggage fee).
3702,I have flown six times with Air Asia this year and have found it to be a good airline for the price. The staff are friendly and the check-in staff have been helpful. The planes are always clean and comfy. The only down side to Air Asia is their KL terminal. The terminal is confusing the flights are nearly always late and the walk from the terminal to the plane can be long (especially if it is windy and raining). But for friendliness cleanliness and price I would recommend Air Asia.
3703,"Checked into Alaska Airlines at the Santa Rosa airport 2 hours before take off. The plane was 30 minutes late. Because they were late they decided to rush boarding and instead of the allotted 30 minutes it was more like 10-15 minutes. My 70 year mom and dad were right behind us in security. My husband and I got through security and we were rushed to get on the plane. I told them there were 2 more behind us. They decided to just cut the line there and didn't let them board! To top it off I was worried about my 70 year old mom (she was upset and crying) so I asked the flight attendant about my mom and dad not being on the plane. She snapped at me that it was too bad, and that they probably weren't there on time. I responded that we checked into the airport 2 hours previously. She said rudely, 'so?'. My mom ended up having to fly out of her way north to Seattle and them back down to San Diego to make it in time. Horrible airline, insensitive staff, rude, and couldn't care less about their customers and how they treat then."
3704,Outbound flight Gatwick to Toronto was fine paid for extra leg room and the cabin configuration was the conventional 242 check in at Gatwick was in the bowels of the building and was tediously slow good in flight entertainment. Return flight was on their new 3x3x3 configuration which was like flying in a sardine tin. Did not get the extra leg room seats we had ordered and paid for the new configuration makes it impossible to get any sleep on night flights the aisles are so narrow that passing passengers stewards and trolleys bump into you all the time. This is the only overnight transatlantic flight I have ever taken where you need to buy or bring your own blanket! This is taking penny pinching to a whole new level. Food was edible but not a lot of it so if your planning to fly Transat take your own food with you avoid night flights and don't forget your own blanket shin and elbow guards! I suggest you consider another airline or book their business class option which is competitively priced but difficult to get as there are so few seats (3 rows I think).
3705,YUL-ATH-YUL all flights were fine and on time with the new cabin with individual screens on the outbound leg only. Check in was normal. The seats were uncomfortable for both flights despite the new cabin. In flying entertainment was good for the outbound leg with a choice of recent movies but it was bad on the return flight that showed 3 old movies on the overhead screens. The service onboard was normal nothing special. The crew was fine but some of them are rude and unwelcoming towards ground agents. I usually fly with Air Transat because there's convenient non stop flights and I had a stand by ticket so no complains on that side. Overall Air Transat is not the best airline as it claims and if you expect a 5 star service it's not the right airline.
3706,I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown. The inflight service however is OK given its a totally discount airline with no frills whatsoever - you will pay for everything including water.
3707,KUL-SIN-KUL. Overall flight experience is fair only. Flight delayed 20 min because one of the crews absence and had to wait for another staff to replace. The staff seem to be moody and not so friendly from KUL-SIN but from SIN-KUL the staff are happy and providing good service.
3708,"Poor customer service and support! We purchased two direct round-trip non-refundable flights from Ireland to Riga in mid-February for travel in late May for roughly $600 then made our non-refundable hotel reservations in Riga and Ireland. Air Baltic cancelled our flights in mid-March with a form letter telling us to ""have a nice flight"". They offered to put us on flights 2 days later on departure and 1 day early on return. I informed the AirBaltic that we had non-negotiable hotel reservations and asked AirBaltic to work with us with their air travel partners to get us on other alternate flights to Riga on our established travel dates for roughly the same cost. I provided the specific flight connection info. No substantive response was from them. I then requested a full refund on the website. The website was non- functional. I sent them an email to requested a refund and rebooked through another airline at a cost of more than $500 above our original AirBaltic fare. AirBaltic still provides the short Baltic Sea overflight. The beneficiary of this fare scam appears to be AirBaltic operating with minimal competition in the Riga air travel market . They are charging us more for a short hop flight than our original Dublin-Riga round-trip. Avoid them if you can."
3709,"One way, PDX-LAX. Everything was smooth sailing. Seats were comfortable, staff were great, and the flight was on time. I also like the electrical outlets in the seats. The big disappointment was the food. Nothing substantial on this flight except cookies and a small bag of pretzels. They made such a big deal about their cookies. I would have preferred an option such as fruit or cheese and crackers. I don't really know what they are thinking with this. I would have given them a 10 if not for the snack issue."
3710,Took an Air Asia X flight to Japan. Flight arrived early and the staff were very helpful. Seat was comfortable enough for me to doze off the entire 6 hours back to Kuala Lumpur (a pretty difficult thing to do for me!). Savings made on the flight was used for fun and exciting things during the trip. Great value for money!
3711,Very expensive to check in baggage unfriendly staff etc. Air Baltic is not a low cost airline! Tickets are very expensive and very often when you are booking tickets on their web site an error occurs and when you start over again the price is almost double!
3712,Not really worth the extra money. I flew with Corsair Business class two months ago and for the same extra money I had more comfort than the Transat new refurbished Club Class I also flew their Club Class a couple of years ago with their let me tell you that their seats were more comfortable then the new one. Unfortunately I have booked return the same way.
3713,Bangkok - Macau return 20th Sep return on 22nd. Excellent flight for low budget airline choose the first row in plane priority boarding. Only problem was the 20 minutes delay with no explanations.
3714,SVO-RIX-SVO. I liked both flights. The crew was friendly and efficient. All flights on time. The food which was on sale on-board was very good! Legroom was a bit insufficient for me but I guess it's an OK situation for a low-cost airline.
3715,RIX-AMS. Completely inadequate experience and will never use this airline again. In Amsterdam there was a massive queue - I arrived 2 hours in advance but despite that I noticed everything was moving so slowly at the airport simply because not enough desks were open. Being concerned about missing my flight I walked up to the desk indicating I was worried to miss my flight and was told not to worry. When it was finally my turn to check in I was told I was too late for check in and they cancelled my ticket. When confronting them with the situation that I was assured not to worry they started laughing and was also told that they would not reimburse the money - ended up flying Lufthansa instead.
3716,KUL-Seoul. Thanks to the online system it's very convenient to book my ticket with particulars such as the ticket pricing airport taxes luggage costs and insurance fees made clear. Checking-in luggage is also made easy via web and I checked-in my luggage 7 days before the actual departure. The departure was punctual as scheduled. Enough seating space for my legs to be stretched out. Satisfied with the overhead space for hand luggage. Reading is easy with private overhead lighting which doesn't disturb others. Food offered was uniquely Malaysian though it could've been better if everything offered was available. Toilets were satisfactorily clean. My luggage arrived safely according to schedule.
3717,Flew return PER-KUL. Terrible service dirty planes and smaller seats compared to other airlines using same A330.
3718,I flew Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur and return. If flying from Melbourne I strongly suggest to use online check- in. They had only one check-in counter open for regular check-ins and 6 for online. As a result despite arriving at the airport a full two and a half hours before departure I and many other passengers had to run through the airport to get the gate in time. Pre-purchased food was uninteresting and one of them almost cold. Legroom is pretty bad. The staff are generally quite friendly and helpful. Check-in immigration etc at LCCT were all much easier and faster than Melbourne.
3719,"March 9 2013. DMK-KUL AK1941. March 12 2013 KUL-DMK FD2916. You cannot expect much from a low cost airline but Air Asia certainly hits the bottom when they not only charge a 12 USD supplement for their ""Red Seats"" where you have more knee space (although the difference is nominal) but they also charge a supplement for the other seats as if you could fly standing. But what revolted me most is that you have to pay extra charges for the use of a wheelchair (3 USD per use amounting to 12 USD for a round trip) to make money from handicapped people is a novelty."
3720,"SUB-KUL-HKT-CNX-KUL-SUB. SUB-KUL flight was pushed an hour early to 5.40am due to airport being overcrowded on Eidl Fitr holiday which was somewhat understandable. Having printed our boarding passes we still had to line up at the check in counter to pay airport tax. Once we arrived in KL we were ushered through the flight transfer area where staff informed us of our next departure gate and we had a pleasant 3 hour transit at the LCCT. Flights to and within Thailand were pleasant and punctual. Evening flight from Phuket to Chiang Mai they ran out of food by the time the crew got to our seats so we had instant noodles instead. In Chiang Mai we had to line up at the check in counter again to get a stamp in order to pass through the security check. We were rudely denied entry into the flight transfer area in KL on the way back to Surabaya because ""the flights were booked under different booking codes"". Note that there is no way to book AK and QZ flights under single purchase on the airline website and when we inquired the staff she mumbled something about ""not paying a transfer fee"" and us getting past the transfer hall last week was not meant to be part of procedure. We took our case to an immigration officer who accompanied us back to the transfer staff but turns out the immigration had to comply to airline policies. Begrudgingly we lined up at the long immigration lines to have our passports stamped entered the departure hall and lined up at the immigration again to find out that our flight was delayed 30 minutes. I am not going to fly Air Asia again unless I have no other choice."
3721,"Air Asia Japan: I got an excellent deal around 10000 yen return to Sappor half the price of ANA and JAL. One way ticket with absolutely no frills. Aircraft smelling new cabin crew quite nice seat pitch very tight but bearable for a short flight something to expect for a LCC. I was extremely surprised by their ""boarding"" gate and waiting area: it was some space taken from a warehouse and a tent from where passengers are bussed to the airplane. Although I know it's a LCC it it's not what I expected for a major international airport! Arrival and Departure at Sapporo was at a ""deluxe"" gate with a boarding bridge and normal waiting room next to ANA gates.Otherwise it was OK and good price/quality. But do not expect anything luxurious from them!"
3722,"I recently flew first class from Cancun Mexico to Seattle Washington. Having tried many times to upgrade and not having any luck I was excited that I finally got the chance. My boyfriend and I each used 10000 points to splurge on the trip home. I would never have done so if I knew how poor the service would be. Our steward was beyond rude. He offered no service whatsoever was totally unhelpful with any questions and hung out in the front away from the passengers. We had to ask for more water let alone a drink and when we did his attitude was atrocious. I realize first class isn't what it used to be but had I known what this would have been like I would have saved my points and stayed in coach I've had much better service there! Very disappointing for my first time going ""first class""."
3723,"Worst flight I have ever been on narrow seats with arm rests which would not fold down - rude staff who were not interested in passenger needs. My daughter was ill during the last 3 hours of the 9 hour flight from Vancouver to Glasgow. When I asked for some water I was asked to wait until the crew had finished collecting the garbage! It never arrived! Heaven knows how they would deal with a serious emergency on board. We asked for milk for the coffee - the response was ""we only give out cream with the coffee"". Recommend this airline? Not a chance!"
3724,Flew 19 June 2013 Manchester - Calgary return flight 30 June 2013 Calgary - Manchester. Experienced tired old systems and lacking a good meal outbound. Basically handed the left over of a vegetarian meal. Both aircraft's were dated mediocre entertainment repeated on the return journey. Please note that the prices are very cheap for these flights so one has to weigh up the pros and cons. A great deal of consideration will have to be made regarding any future travel. I will admit that the money saved gave us extra for our holiday arrangements. You get what you pay for in this instance.
3725,Flew Glasgow to Toronto and back definitely no frills but took off on time outbound and inbound food okay didn't use the entertainment as it is old style screens. Didn't get any more or less than expected. Would fly with them again.
3726,Pekanbaru to Bandung and vice versa. During the flight there was nothing too special. Special services for passengers with red carpet service in Pekanbaru - nothing. Should correspond to their advertising - red carpet passenger will be allowed to board the plane first but red carpet passengers in Pekanbaru were mixed with ordinary passengers during boarding. In fact there were regular passengers before me on my first flight.
3727,FD 2976/2977 Bangkok -?“Denpasar return. A very disappointing experience. Checked in online and only had to drop our bag spent over an hour at the counter waiting for staff to reconcile their problem. Good that they are using Don Muang Airport otherwise the long immigration line would worsen the experience unorganized boarding and people in hot seats ended up among the last to board. Things get slightly better on the aircraft. Emergency exit ??hot seat??pretty comfortable with no other passengers next to me and I end up taking all 3 seats for myself. Pre- ordered breakfast (Pancake) is delicious great punctuality. Other than that things are pretty horrible and chaotic. Pre-ordered food on the return flight inedible rice stale meat overcooked and obviously is re-heated more than once. Drinks sold on board are lukewarm Flight attendants try to be overly friendly. Hot seat when the plane is full became unbearable for such long flight. Will avoid in the future.
3728,PER-KUL-DMK. Booked ticket 3 months earlier received reminder/confirmation email 4 days before departure 2 days before departure another email showing different times by 5 hours - no explanation just confirmation of flights but with different departure/arrival times. Arrival at DMK (Bangkok) would have had us there 1 hour after our connecting flight had left. No option but to go 1 day earlier and stay in hotel. Chaotic check-in at DMK under staffed 1 hour just waiting to check-in not good enough especially when it's a premium ticket they claim dedicated check-in for premium but no such counter exists. At the end of it all total cost was more than $100 more each than original quote on find flights result page.
3729,SGN-KUL-LGK-KUL-SGN. Online check in is convenient but document check in LCCT KUL (KUL-SGN) is very inconvenient for pax because of lack of information on screen (line for KUL-SGN flight) change counter and waiting at gate (Y1 Y2) so long. The arrangement in terminal is not good pax standing in font of Y1 Y2 gate will be bother by others going to oversize luggage inside. In flight LGK-KUL there was a medium turbulence on take-off phase airplane was down but no announcement was delivered.
3730,Dushanbe-Riga-London Gatwick. This is a long flight (5 hours to Riga) with a chaotic check in at Dushanbe where most passengers seemed to have to go out of the check in area to change money to pay for hold baggage which they thought had been included in their ticket (including me). Luckily had the middle seat free between myself and fellow passenger so lack of seat space was not as acute as it could have been. Did not buy any food on the flight from Dushanbe to Riga/London. Riga-London was OK. Although arrivals at Gatwick was packed was able to use IRIS automated immigration barrier to avoid the wait. There is very limited choice if travelling to/from Dushanbe - basically it's either Air Baltic or Turkish Airlines. If the travel dates coincide with Turkish Airlines I would go with them rather than Air Baltic.
3731,Travelled from Philadelphia to Maui via Seattle. Flew first class. After take off flight attendant stated that there were only 16 first class meals on board for the 16 first class seats. There were two choices of menu 8 each. She started taking orders at the front of the first class section and I was setting in the back when she got to me there were no choices left take the remaining selection or nothing. So I end up with nothing. She came back and offered me a cheese platter with 7 grapes and two so so cheeses and some crackers. Seats were standard first class seats which did not come close to lay flat. Hand held entertainment device did not work. Poor excuse for a first class flight.
3732,LGW-YVR TS 577 Jul 26 2013. YVR-LGW TS 676 10 Aug 2013. Pretty good on the whole. Being over 6ft isn't wildly comfortable should have chosen my seat better. Only comment is that it seems to get a smiley person to serve you you need to be in club class. There were some miserable flight attendants - passengers were polite around us and made the effort but the flight attendants didn't. We were near the front and the attendants in club class were very cheerful. It doesn't cost anything to smile and be helpful - some customer service training is required. Ground staff were excellent and helpful both ways. Good flight very smooth. Aircraft interior a bit old but you get what you pay for it was considerably cheaper than BA etc.
3733,MEL-KUL aircraft seemed new seats had more legroom than my return journey on Malaysian Airlines and the food was much more tasty than Malaysian. Inflight entertainment was non existent personally if they had a screen on the back of the seats with a credit card swipe facility I would be more than happy to pay for the service I don't like tablet screens though so I wouldn't rent one of their Samsung units. Overall it was a very reasonable flight great flight attendants arrived on time and price was one quarter than Malaysian wanted. Just need more flights MEL-KUL now a 3rd daily would definitely fill up with their competitive pricing!
3734,Cochin to Kuala Lumpur. Most uncomfortable flight I've been on. There is practically no leg space. Add to it the fact that I had a window seat with the other two seats filled in by slightly heavyset people and I felt like I didn't even have breathing space. It was so cramped that I didn't have space to move my hands. The choice of food on board is poor. Even when I asked for something that was on the menu they didn't have it. The only good thing was the rate but given the condition of the flight even the cheap rates do not sound tempting.
3735,While booking electronic ticket on Internet for my father I made a mistake writing my first name instead of his. I discovered it immediately after the booking and called the sales office in Lithuania asking to change the name. They said this would costs around euro 80. This is more than the price I paid for one way ticket Vilnius-Copenhagen. No account given to the fact that I acted promptly. When I asked whether I could turn to somebody elsE at the company I was told e-mail of the customer service office. I sent them a polite e-message and probably a dozen of reminders but never received an answer. The customer service appears to be as bad as at the worst low-fare companies. My advice If having possibility use other companies.
3736,The check in at Riga is unacceptably slow chaotic and overcrowded. If you check in at a machine you have to join a long queue to hand in your baggage. Their attitude is unhelpful and unfriendly. Meals and drinks in flight are not free glass of water is extortionate - about five times the cost of a small bottle - and that is just for a glass.
3737,"SEA to IAH return. First time flying on Alaska. Both legs were on time. Service was friendly. I appreciate the communication from the pilot or first officer with respect to turbulence and what's happening with the flight. Leg room was decent for economy class. Not a big fan of their food and beverage selections. Being a bit of a nervous flyer I generally tend to ask for 3 glasses of red wine when drink service is offered so I can slip slowly and make them last for a 4 hour flight and mellow out. One Flight Attendant took exception to me ordering 3 glasses (apparently fearing I was going to become intoxicated on the flight). In addition the wine service is poured from a bottle into a plastic cafeteria cup. Other airlines simply give you a little bottle which you pour yourself (which I much prefer). So this aspect was about the only thing that I give a thumbs down to. Another thing I like about some other airlines you have your own IFE system display. For me it's a matter of simply selecting ""My Flight"" as I like to see the progress of the flight. Not possible with Alaska."
3738,"There was no in-flight entertainment. Even the flight tracker was broken and the display wasn't clear. Our attempts to get the flight attendants attention went unnoticed. I assume they follow processes that have no room for extra customer requests. The flights were great, the pilots did a great job. The planes seemed new, but there was trash in the magazine compartment, with magazines themselves dirty or missing. Overall, not much to do on a cross-atlantic flight, make sure you have your own entertainment. Do not fly through Rome, it's pretty disorganized after their international terminal had a fire (we missed a connection flight), use of overloaded shuttle buses, etc. I would fly again only if it's a much cheaper option."
3739,"KUL-KTM. Arrived at the airport to find out that the flight had been delayed by over 3 hrs no prior notification from the airline whatsoever premium check in was quick and was told by the check in lady that the flight had been ""re-timed "" a good substitution for the word delay I suppose. Boarding meant for 2.30 pm did not even commence by 3.15 pm and there was no information passed onto us. Only after a few angry passengers made their way to the gate counter were they told eventually at 4 pm that the flight had been cancelled. Again no apologies at all and we were made to sit for almost 90 mins before they let us out of the gate lounge way back through immigration and then get out bags and finally onto a bus to the hotel that was arranged for us for the night. The flight eventually flew the next morning at 9.30 am. The way Air Asia X staff handled the situation was worse than appalling no apologies no information passed on in fact they seemed the ones who were agitated with all the questions being asked to them and not us who were there at the airport by 9 am and only got to leave at 5.30pm. The plane an Airbus 330 was clean and the inflight service as per your AA standards."
3740,KUL-SYD return. KUL LCCT was chaotic and premium check-in counter hard to find. Once there luggage drop- off was quick staff polite. No separation between premium and economy in entering holding room. Long uncertain wait with unclear announcements. Separate boarding of plane between premium (first) and economy (slightly later). Cabin was 2-4-2. Seat-Bed was approx flat with a slight drop-off below the calf. Incline of approx 15% to floor but comfortable enough. One simple hot meal with bottle of water included. Left punctually and arrived on time.
3741,SYD-KUL was 30 minutes late but the food was okay. The only things I really did was play on my ipad because the flight was very boring. KU-SYD night flight was on time but no food or beverages. Toilets were clean on both flights and the seats look brilliant but 2 hours into the flight you can clearly see the poor padding. I also couldn't get to sleep on the night flight. Overall Air Asia is ok but I would prefer Qantas or Virgin.
3742,This is my second bad experience with Air Baltic. The first time I had a direct flight from Berlin to Vilnius and the plane was overbooked so they sent me via Warsaw so instead of 1.5 hour travel time I ended up traveling for 5 hours. Second time I had a direct ticket from Oslo to Vilnius. My flight was canceled and I was offered either a refund or a different non-direct flight in the evening instead of morning. I chose a refund and still waiting for it. The representative told me that it will take at least 6 weeks to get a refund!
3743,SEA-IAH first class 739 equipment. Boarding was fine and efficient. Left about ten minutes late due to catering not being available until last minute. Hit cruise 19 minutes into flight but it was fully an hour before FA served drinks. Nothing unusual going on so this was inexplicable. Service was friendly but very slow.
3744,12/1/14 ORD-SEA Flt 29. Arrived at the airport about 1.5 hours early. Only 1 agent at the counter. Waited about 15 mins before another agent appeared to assist. Once there it went smoothly and quickly. Boarding was efficient and able to be seated quickly. We were issued their digiplayers. Fair selection of movies to view but really no place to put the player when the meal arrived. A bit cumbersome. Meal offered was one choice only. It was tasty but portions have certainly been scaled back. Flight attendant disappeared after the meal service. Arrived on time. However I remember Alaska having a far superior service to that of its rivals but this flight did not prove that at all.
3745,"Both ground crew and flight attendants lack customer satisfaction skills - treat the customer with indifference. Pre-booked seats outbound and inbound only to find they changed seats both ways without any communication. Plane was old and seats were very uncomfortable. Large TV monitors ran down the middle aisle every 6-7 rows and most didn't work properly. Food was mediocre. Terrible, terrible airline. I would never recommend Alitalia."
3746,"On June 25, 2015 we flew back to Toronto from Rome after a Mediterranean cruise. This flight had been booked in October 2014, and the seats reserved. They changed our seats and put us in the very last row, where the seats don't recline and between 2 toilets. Apparently they can change your seats whenever they want. So we spent nine hours listening to the toilets flush, no windows, could not recline the seats, while the seats in front of us were right in our face. The food was so bad. The plane was an old one, with one small TV screen every 8 rows, and the one closest to us didn't work. We will never fly with this airline again."
3747,OOL - KUL return. A great idea for a budget carrier to have premium seats. Pity they didn't consider making them long enough for the average traveller. Seat comfort is great for a day time flight pretty woeful for a night time flight. Entertainment provided on a portable tablet (that has to be paid for) and the content is fairly pathetic. One free meal provided and it was average but the satay which can also be pre-ordered is ok. I'm not sure I would choose this carrier again but you get what you pay for and if you don't have high expectations then it's you might think it's value for money.
3748,KUL-TPE return in premium class. Well kept A330 comfortable angled lie flat seats. There were just 3 seats occupied and cabin was quiet and peaceful. 2 free bottles of water and a meal provided. Outbound flight was delayed by 1 hr return by over 2 no apology/explanation given. This Airlines has a lot of potential but substantial delays on both ways does not allow me to recommend this medium/long haul carrier.
3749,KUL-SYD on A330-300 in economy. Check-in was easy and staff were friendly. Pre-booked seats given. Boarding was a little chaotic but at least the walk to the plane wasn't too far this time. Seats are very narrow with poor recline. It is very uncomfortable on an overnight flight. There is 9-abreast seating when it is normally only 8-abreast on the same aircraft on full-service carriers. The headrest is also very uncomfortable. Hand-carry luggage was not properly monitored which caused some problems with boarding. Comfort amenities only provided if paid for. Meals (either pre-booked or paid for onboard) were small and of poor quality. Cabin crew were a little disorganised but generally friendly and helpful. Flight was generally on time. I would definitely pay more for an economy seat on a full-service carrier especially on overnight flights.
3750,SYD-KUL on A330-300. Successful upgrade to Premium through Optiontown. Check-in at SYD was fast and easy. No fast-track through immigration or security but this is a budget carrier after all. Priority boarding provided. Premium seats comfortable and are angled flat. This is a basic version of the business class seat one would get on a full-service carrier. Pillow and blanket provided. One complimentary meal provided which is the same as economy but it was small and not very good either. No entertainment provided unless paid for. Cabin crew were generally friendly but not particularly attentive. Flight was on time. The LCCT in KUL is a terrible terminal. There are no aerobridges and the walk to the terminal can be quite long. It is also chaotic and has poor signage especially when trying to work out transport options such as transferring to KLIA or catching the train into the city. I'd avoid flying AirAsia just to avoid going through this terminal!
3751,"My experience has been very negative flying with them. I flew with them last weekend from Phuket to Jakarta and the flight was 6 hours delayed. Absolutely no compensation provided. Our flight was changed from 7.30pm to 1.30am so we eventually arrived at 3.30am. No apologies or explanation given by the airline either. On top of this we paid for a ""hot seat"" which was uncomfortable and didn't recline. Never flying with them again. The food choices were also really bad. Many things were missing from the menu as they ""ran out""."
3752,DUB-RIX-TBS and IST-RIX-TXL. Prices to Eastern Europe are usually unbeatable but staff could be more polite. Check-in staff in Riga was outright rude okay in Dublin and Istanbul. Check- in opened very late in Istanbul (1.5 hours prior to departure) which meant a long wait in the rather uncomfortable check-in hall at IST. Overly strict on the check-in weight limit. Cabin cleanliness was okay flight otherwise uneventful.
3753,12/4/14 SEA to ORD Flt 22. When checking in one has to perform a self bag tag and then take the luggage to the check in desk. There were 2 of us - we had 1 bag to check. It was over by 4lbs but since you are allowed two pieces of luggage per person we were well with in the weight limit. Too bad cost $75. Flight departed on time. Staff were friendly service was standard. Same meal offered on both segments but yet again nothing remarkable that would make me select this carrier over the competition. Once meal was served and one refresher of drinks the FA disappeared. I was disappointed with the overall service. It is not what I was accustomed to. A digiplayer for the entertainment was handed out but it is cumbersome to have on your tray table when the meal is served.
3754,"My flight and subsequent experience with Alitalia, was the worst I have had. The flight attendants were rude, they forgot to give me a meal and when reminded, in a polite way, they didn't ever produce a meal. Luckily it was an overnight flight so not essential. On arrival in Rome, this was a direct flight, my luggage was lost / delayed. I spent a week in Tuscany minus any change of clothing, trying to locate the luggage by phoning frequently (several Italian speaking friends also helped me by trying to connect with customer service), to no avail. I was in a remote area, so could not even shop for essentials. When someone finally answered the phone they had no knowledge as to where my suitcase was. At the end of the week, after a spoiled vacation, I still encountered difficulties at the Rome airport. I was sent from one terminal to another, by very disinterested staff. in order to reunite with my luggage. The whole experience left me with a very negative impression of Alitalia and its staff."
3755,"This plane had to have been made in the 90's or even earlier, it was so old and outdated. One small TV per 30 seats. Our flight was an overnight flight that left at 11pm and the lights were turned off for take-off and everyone got cozy just in time for them to turn the lights on at 12.15am to serve dinner, which wasn't appropriate for either time zone. They kept the lights on until 1.30am. The worst part - the flight attendants went to sleep in their reserved extra large seats with leg rests in the middle of the economy class. Not only did 6 of them go to sleep on the plane, but they put up a blanket divider around their section which was attached to the overhead compartments with velcro, and laid completely in front of the seat in front of me, blocking the pocket to store things. Food was awful. Service was awful. Attendants were rude."
3756,First time with Air Transat and we were very disappointed in the level of customer service. They only take credit card on the plane so if you want to buy a blanket you have to charge it. The plane to Amsterdam only had TV's in the overhead so if you didn't like the movie on the 8 hours flight then you had to suffer. If you are sitting near the front and have to use the bathroom - good luck because the toilets are at the very back of the plane (the other two at the front of the plane are reserved for the 20 people in Business Class). During check in at Pearson they only had 1 counter open for economy class and 2 counters open for Business Class. We were also lied to at the check-in counter about a 'change of planes' for the reason we didn't get out pre-purchased seat assignments. Overall a bad choice of airline.
3757,Manchester to Toronto and return. This is a budget airline at non budget prices. They don't accept cash on board charge you for headsets and blankets. The try to stop you using your own headset. They turn down the air conditioning just after take off to try and get you to rent a blanket the turn it up again. No seat screens only overhead ones hence no choice. Food was basic and just about thrown at you. Miserable flight attendants. The only plus was the flight was on time. On the return we stood in a line for 2.5 hours to check in. The check in opened 2 hours later that advertised. Apparently due to a switch of aircraft. No offer of drinks etc. apparently they had to input all data manually. People with pre booked seats and boarding passes all had to wait they were even altering seating at the gate. Left 45 mins late. Would never use Air Transat again. The have a monopoly on the Manchester - Toronto route so don't give a hoot.
3758,MEL-KUL. An 8.5 hour flight on A330-300 on premium class. The flight was delayed a few minutes. Really comfortable seat. Meals were OK but lack of choices. They really need to add some more meal choices. Moreover some of the meals on the menu ran out quickly. No inflight entertainment at all but it can be understood since it's a low cost flight. However it will be great if they provide entertainment for premium class passengers. Friendly and attentive flight attendants.
3759,In the last month my husband and I went on 4 Air Asia flights. It was a mixed experience. The inflight entertainment is very limited. Whilst some of the service was good and they were generally courteous there were inconsistencies across the board. We paid for an inflight entertainment package on our last flight but did not receive it. But on one of our flights we scored a deal where we were able to upgrade to premium which was much better and the service was more frequent but still very patchy. An experience which has really left a very poor taste in my mouth was having a check in lady be very rude and abrupt with my husband.
3760,Flew one of the Alaska/Horizon regional routes PDX-MFR night flight. The flight was originally at 9.05-ish but was delayed to 9.55. Got info 3 hours ahead of time and we still boarded late because traffic on the taxiway. Once aboard seats were fairly comfy flight attendants were friendly easily accommodated my sister's severe nut allergy made sure no nut-containing items were aboard the plane (standard airline safety procedure) and served two drinks for a flight less than an hour. Not bad Alaska.
3761,"Horrible experience. Both on departure than on return. To start with we had a delay of more than 2 hours because of a problematic passenger (not company's fault) but no A/C and nothing was made to make it up. On return both flights were late and I almost missed my correspondance in Rome due to a late landing and messy airport organisation. On top of that Alitalia lost my luggage. Will never flight again with them, even if I have to pay more for others."
3762,"Worst flight to Europe in many years! Tightest seating, surly cabin crew, bad food and service. Would never have booked Alitalia except for the fact that this was a hard-to-see code share' booked on Delta internet site. In my book this makes Delta an accomplice. Don't they know Alitalia is dramatically substandard compared to Delta?"
3763,"Flew Manchester to Vancouver and Calgary to Manchester return in Club Class in June 2013. Two very different experiences. Outbound a refurbished cabin which was clean light and airy - excellent. Wide leather seats with ample legroom even for my 6' 4"" son. Attentive crew pampered throughout with good food and drinks. Excellent personal inflight entertainment screen and film selection. Overall a high quality experience which exceeded our expectations and was great value for money. Score ""10 out of 10"". Inbound flight an old aircraft tired and tatty. Only saving grace good legroom and staff did their best to keep customers happy. Overall an average experience which was at bare minimum for price paid. The sooner Air Transat complete the upgrade of all planes the better. Score ""6 out of 10""."
3764,Major setback for my recent flight back to Melbourne from Kuala Lumpur on the 23rd June 2012. My pre- booked 'hot seat' was next to the narrow aisle and was constantly bumped by their clumsy trolley. The ambience of the cabin was hot when I asked about it the cabin crews were clueless and unsympathetic. I shall never fly with them again in the future even if the price is marginally lower than other premium airlines.
3765,"KUL-SGN. Lovely looking stewardesses and new aircraft. Reasonably comfortable seats even for my 6ft 2"" 18 stone frame. But check in immigration departure lounge baggage reclaim? Just prepare to be treated third class and expect to be herded like cattle. They certainly bring a whole new level to ""no frills airlines"". Cheap and great for hopping around South East Asia truly the Greyhound in the skies."
3766,Took Alaska to Cabo on Sept 15th Alaska stated flight is still going. Get to San Diego Cabo flight still going. 30 minutes later our flight is cancelled. Alaska says no seats open back to Seattle tough luck. Find out the Cabo airport was shut down the day before and Alaska flew us to San Diego knowing this.
3767,"Both flights are fairly short, however the E-195 cabin is much more comfortable, spacious and modern than the much older A320 that Alitalia used on the Rome - Amsterdam route. Both flights had underwhelming catering onboard. Other than drinks and a few snacks, no real meals were served. On my way from Amsterdam to Rome, I had an Alitalia flight number, but the flight was operated by KLM and they had great sandwich options onboard."
3768,"Booked a business class ticket, I regret it as it was nowhere near a business standard. No Lounge. No amenities. Not even a pillow. Old aircrafts. If you must travel with this airline, do not bother paying for business class, they do not have one. You will get packed in like sardines on buses to connect from one flight to another."
3769,"Bucharest to New York JFK via Rome FCO. To save time at our connection in FCO (only 45 minutes!), the Alitalia check-in employee gave us boarding passes for OTP-FCO and FCO-JFK, however the check-in line was very slow. First flight was normal with nothing special. Flight was delayed by 15 minutes due to air-traffic in Rome. Fairly clean aircraft. They served us some crackers, but nothing more. However, never fly Alitalia long-haul economy unless it's your only option! Ground services were pretty slow. We had to wait 15 minutes for a bus to drive us to terminal 3! Flight to New York also delayed, this time by an hour. Seats in the plane were extremely uncomfortable, there was an entertainment equipment box blocking me from having legroom, outdated entertainment systems, and bad food. That's why Alitalia plane tickets are so cheap."
3770,Perth-KUL-Ho Chi Minh-KUL-Denpasar-KUL-OOL. Good value for money. Good seating and crew were helpful and courteous. No problem with the food. I did find their terminal at KUL chaotic and lack lustre and you have to walk a long way to the plane in some instances. I paid for the Optiontown upgrade and got the one from Perth to KUL which was nice. Wouldn't get to experience that on another airline! I give them a thumbs up for making flying affordable.
3771,SYD-KUL return - First flight with AirAsia X but have flown AirAsia domestic and Thai AirAsia. No surprises for me I booked my seats and food. Paid around $400 return less than half the price of QA BA or MAS. Did not get to use the inflight entertainment system and I was a little bored on the flight out of Sydney flight time was a little over 9 hours due to weather. Food was good. FA's friendly. On the flight back I paid for hot seats (35B and 35C). Had plenty of leg room but got woken up by people slamming the toilet door and standing in the space next to the exit talking really loudly. The only issues I had with the flight was the other passengers. I managed to buy an extra meal on the way back and it was good. My bag was damaged but I am sure this was due to the lethal baggage carousels at SYD. If you fly AAX pre-book your seats and your meals.
3772,The staff constantly see the need to come behind the curtain exposing two bright lights to passengers who pay the privilege of sitting in row 1A in executive class. These insensitive staff feel the need to conduct a loud and animated conversation within the executive cabin throughout the night. We pay for lie flat beds and are constantly subjected to being woken up at constant period throughout the night and not from fellow passengers. The food is poor and who cares for duty free so why do they need to charge down the aisle every 15 minutes. My rubbish was never collected.
3773,MEL-KUL. The check-in was smooth but the check-in counter at Melbourne was overcrowded and the queue ridiculously long. Check-in staff carried out her duty in a rather unfriendly manner and my assumption was because we opted for low cost carrier and hence be seen as substandard. Boarding was painfully slow but it was with other airlines as well. The aircraft was jam-packed and the cabin interior was lacklustre. My pre- order of Pak Nasser's Nasi Lemak was excellent perhaps the only great point about the entire journey. The 'hot seat' as it might sound had plenty of legroom but the seat was equally small and uncomfortable (not worth the AUD 45 at all). It was a relief that there was no delay throughout the journey. As always AirAsia X is a low-cost carrier and I will think twice before I book for my next flight with AirAsia X.
3774,Kuala Lumpur - Taipei. There was a huge delay for our flight to Taipei and we sat in the uncomfortable cabin for almost an hour before the aircraft decided to take off. Passengers queue up for WC even when there was turbulence and the flight attendants were unprofessional and inefficient in the way they managed the unruly crowd. The only good thing was that they allowed me to change my seat.
3775,"Melbourne - Chiang Mai return. Plane was a little late leaving Chiang Mai and due to ""congestion"" our plane landed at the international airport - presumably not carrying enough fuel to wait for a landing slot. Passengers not informed of what was happening and many missing connecting flights. Arrived at Air Asia terminal over 3 hours late. The Air Asia staff were if not rude then uncaring. About 20 people eventually marched through immigration and customs to a grotty corner of the airport - the desk for wheelchair service. Over 2 hours to rebook everyone using one computer terminal and entering computer codes manually. No food offered and no information given. Eventually ended up in a backpacker standard hotel - no towels in room no drinking water. To bed at 2am no food. Minimal breakfast in hotel but no lunch offered even though our substitute flight was 1.45pm. Low budget should not mean such rubbish service when the airline is at fault."
3776,"We had flown with Alitalia many times in the past thirty years, and we had always been satisfied with the cabin crew and, of course, with the food and wine. Last year we choose Classica Plus, and it was great. This year we choose regular economy. Actually, before Classica Plus, we always flew economy, and choose Alitalia over its partner, Delta, because of its food service. This time we just couldn't believe it. The New York to Rome flight meal service consisted of dessicated pasta and a couscous salad. No vegetables, no cheese, and a stale roll. We thought it was because of an American supplier that didn't understand that this would be an unacceptable meal for an Italian. We were wrong. On the return flight we had a two-pasta combination which was terrible, and a salad of rice. Before landing, we were served an anemic muffin with no butter or jelly. I guess the new owners have no intention of continuing the wonderful cabin service that we have had in the past. We will now choose Delta."
3777,"Check-in smooth, Priority Security Line, excellent new Preludium Lounge at Warsaw Airport, one of the nicest loungest I've seen. Boarding on time. Quite old A320, with only 1.5 rows of Business Class. No welcome drink, but newspapers and magazines offered, Italian only. After take off - hot towels and meal, which was horrible. From an  Italian airline I'd expect great Italian food and wines, but I got some mushroom salad with ""feta""-like cheese and hot cottage cheese mixed with tomato sauce - inedible. There was no choice of wines, only one kind of each, I took red, but again, poor quality. Except wine glass on a tray, all other drinks were served in a plastic cup. After dinner, grappa and limoncello was served, again in plastic, but limoncello was too strong for my taste. Cabin crew was very nice and perfectly groomed, but food was disaster. No inflight magazine available in any seat pocket, only old and damaged shopping catalogue. Not recommended."
3778,"We arrived at Cagliari airport 3 hours ahead of time so we would be first in line. We explained at the desk that we had a 50 minute connection to make. Because we were travelling with a baby we had to go to the transfers desk in Amsterdam airport to print our boarding pass, so we could not check in early for our international flight. The lady at the desk was rude and surly. She said she would ""See what she could do."" When we asked for seats near the front of the plane so we would have time to make it to our connecting flight. ""What she could do"" was to place us and our two children at the very back of the plane in the very last row where we would have to watch every single other person disembark before us. The plane was 70% full, and there were many seats available near the front of the plane. After this she printed off our tags for checking our bags. She showed us one, showing that the bag would make it all the way to our final destination. All the other labels she didn't show us, and they all were going to the wrong airport altogether. Luckily my wife noticed our stroller tag and ran back to talk to someone else who wasn't so rude. We booked our flights through KLM, and unfortunately had to finish the flight to Sardinia via Alitalia. When we got to the desk to check in (again because we had small children) there was a lot of head scratching and confusion. They tried to charge us for our baggage that we had already paid for, which would have cost us an additional $200 Euros. We booked our flight through KLM and all our bags are entitled to go with us from start to finish. So after an hour at the desk while they made snide comments again we were placed at the very back of the plane. From start to finish the ground crew were rude and dismissive."
3779,Toronto to Gatwick return. Flights on time but do not waste your money on advance seat selection. Did not get paid for seats on either flight couldn't even sit with my wife on the return flight. Advance check in website did not work for return flight most seemed to be in the same predicament as check in line was huge but no one using the bag drop line. Check in agent tried to charge overweight for bag that he stuffed into the scale but strangely enough weight was fine when bag was put on the belt properly. Upgraded to Club at gate for outbound flight when original seats were unavailable old seats armrest trays and no seatback entertainment not really much different from economy. I wasn't expecting much from airline food but the meals in both directions were of a standard I would have hesitated to give to my dog.
3780,SYD-KUL. These flights were ridiculously cheap and although I was fearful it was not a bad experience. The main disadvantage of using this airline is the LCCT at KUL which is just a hassle in terms of transport and facilities. I took KLIA transit which was ok. The plane (A330) was pretty neat and the seat was comfortable. The plane was packed for both flights. Meals can only be pre-ordered and are not available for sale. No entertainment options were offered. Both flights were about 30 mins late. I applied for optiontown upgrades on both flights but did not get either. On line check-in worked well but there are no 2D barcode scanners at Sydney airport.
3781,Flew from Cochin to KL to Incheon. If you are taller than 180cm there will be not be enough room for your legs. They will push up against the seat in front and you will constantly get bumped if you're sitting in the aisle. Having to wait at LCCT is an awful experience. The public address system announcing the flights is ridiculously loud and the static is so bad that it's impossible to understand anything being announced. While boarding the crew insist on blasting cheesy rock music regardless of the time. The vegetarian food is over- priced for the small serving I received. The amount of money saved is minimal after adding up all of the extra costs.
3782,"The cabin was staffed with quite a few FAs and we were told that the F&B manager was on board making sure that the service was up to standard for their new something or other ... it was a long spiel. Cabin seemed new, leather and seats reclined nearly but not completely flat. Food was a disaster and my expectations had been raised by the greeting. I ordered the veal (a mistake) and it was tough as I expected but the sauce that was on it was so salty that it was inedible. My traveling partner did not eat as he was asleep. When I asked for something else, I was told that only pre-made cheese plates were left and they all have blue cheese on them to which I am allergic. After that, it seemed that everyone was busy and no beverages or anything else was offered for the remaining four hours of the flight. When the plane was landing, I was asked for feedback and I said that I was hungry since they had no other food. The FA said they did have more food, and offered me something but at that point the trays had to be stowed, etc. I am not sure why this was handled so poorly, I was polite and understand that the crew does not make the food. Even some bread or any other option would have been appreciated and since the person I traveled with did not eat and some seats were empty, it seems odd that they thought they ran out of all other food options."
3783,"Boarding via busses was rather chaotic, some people needed to check in their hand luggage, others not. The flight was operated by Air One. Cabin was clean but worn out, several seats were disfunctional. The seat pitch was the smallest I have had in any airplane. I am just under 6ft and with normal weight, but I could not sit in any position without my knees being crushed by the seat in front of me. Shortly after start the man in front ofme reclined his seat (reclining is very limited) but this made any further movement impossible. The person in front of me claimed that he did not understand English, the stewardess tried to convince him to move his chair upright but he refused. Stewardess told me that it is his right to recline. Fortunately, it was just a little over one hour flight. Cabin attendants were friendly, served a soft drink and sweet or savory snack. Disembarking the plane was again chaotic, the first bus left the tarmac half empty, the second and last bus was overcrowded and felt suffocating, standing in the hot noon sun with doors closed for too long. It is difficult to avoid this airline whenever travelling in Italy, I also had better experiences with Alitalia (but you never know if it is carried out by one of their partners, it was not stated when I checked-in)."
3784,"Great prices reasonably comfortable seats but a risky airline compared to others. Glitches from the start with online booking and customer service is non-existent. We had Option Plus but still had to wait more than an hour in chaotic confined area for boarding passes at Gatwick. My wife's ""priority"" bag didn't show up in Vancouver and the crew there seemed utterly confused as to what to do after I eventually found the service desk. Fortunately they found the bag in London and sent it to Vancouver the next day but were not able or willing to forward it to our house in Washington state necessitating a trip at my expense to the border to pick it up. Even with the great prices I would be very reluctant to use them again."
3785,I would refrain from using this budget again especially on long flights like Sydney-KUL as even basic essentials like free access to drinking water is charged for seats are ridiculously narrow (9 abreast when the Airbus seating should have been 2-4-2 rather than 3-3-3). Not good for long haul passengers.
3786,I have been flying with my wife who has problems walking and needs a wheelchair from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur and return. Flights were on time with nothing adverse to report and a very friendly crew. What is annoying is the way AirAsia are managing to increase prices: additional fee for credit card payment additional fee for seats (I can agree to a supplement for seats with more legroom) but to have to pay an extra fee for any seat is something than even Ryanair has not (yet) considered how can you fly without a seat? Additional fee for wheelchair use (4 USD it means 16 USD for a return trip). If you consider all this the price is not too different from what you can get on regular airlines and this will be my choice next time.
3787,Flew BKK to Singapore with Thai Air Asia. Another bus to the plane. Lot's of empty stands but I think the Airbus and stand do not match. They boarded the bus by row numbers but this soon turned into a free for all. Staff friendly and the normal service standards of a budget airline. Couldn't beat the price compared to the full service airlines.
3788,Flight AK1441 from Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur. Booking and flight document indicated departure of 21.00 Vietnam time and arrival 23.15pm Malaysia time with no delay in departure time. Arrived Kuala Lumpur at 01.15 (the next day) without any transit only to find out later that an added 2hrs flight is due to inconsistency in flight details generated by airline's system against actual flight duration. Ample of residual consequences including airport pickup charter and hotel booking arising with the timing mistake made by the airline's system.
3789,My first flight from Vancouver to Seattle was great - the crew were fantastic. However my flight from Seattle to Salt Lake City was not very enjoyable. I found the crew to be lazy and rude. I tried to order a beverage on the plane and they had closed out early (1 hour early) and right after they had passed with the drink cart. I've flown before and unless there is turbulence then typically a plane will serve you until about 30 minutes before landing. One flight attendant was very rude. I usually love flying Alaska and was about to apply for my Alaska Air credit card but this was very disappointing. I think I may hold back on applying because of this particular experience.
3790,"Completely lacking the generosity of Italy. Alitalia may have a new livery but only serve a cup of coffee, water or OJ and some biscotti. I was starving and hoped to buy a sandwich and a glass of wine or Camparisoda. My next trip to Italy will be on easyJet, air Berlin or Ryanair."
3791,"Flight AZ165 from Brussels to Rome, Fiumicino on 5th June 2015.  I was one of the passengers that were on time to the airport and at the right gate (A59). That wasn't the case with the crew who were late because of traffic problems! Airport announced that boarding wasn't possible at 17.55, we were told to board at 18.40.  I was reassured that not only I would catch my flight from Rome to Athens (AZ722), but also I would have time for an espresso in Fiumicino!  Meanwhile, Brussels weather deteriorated giving us the pleasure of being stay stuck inside the aircraft until 20.15. I agree that bad weather in Brussels Airport is not the airlines responsibility, but if the crew had been on time, the pilot wouldn't have lost the slot and the rest of our journey would have continued normally. On arrival at Fiumicino, all passengers stood in long queues from 22.30 to 23.59!  When we finished, we entered a bus that should take us at Sheraton Hotel, about 20 minutes away.  About half an hour later, the bus departed. I had to leave the hotel at 06.30.  No time for espresso, no time for anything else. My new flight to Athens was waiting for me at 08.40, and again I would be on time. I wondered if your pilots would also be, fortunately this time they did."
3792,"Return trip London - Vancouver. On the flight out the cabin crew were pleasant and attentive although not carrying pens when every passenger has to complete a customs form seemed an oversight. Food was perfectly adequate and occasional sights visible (Iceland Greenland) announced by the Captain. Return leg was bumpier and whilst still pleasant one of the cabin crew was French Canadian without perfect English which made drinks selections a little difficult (she didn't seem to know what root beer or cranberry juice was). Both legs landed early. Entertainment was appalling - a small TV about every eight rows hanging from the ceiling. Fortunately had a kindle and ipad with me. Cabin was very cold and if you want a blanket you have to buy it. I wouldn't call it ""cheap"" but seems to be the least expensive way to the North American West so can forgive their short comings. Not complaint free and I wouldn't label them 'best leisure airline' by a long shot but I'd fly again."
3793,We flew to Vancouver it was just ok in Club TV screen on the wall no choice for a 9 hour trip. Our daughters were in coach and were cramped and hungry and couldn't see the TV so bored as well. We flew back from Calgary and the flight was worse there was still the old style TV's on the wall we were at the front so had the clatter of the kitchen throughout the night as well as the steward talking loudly about his weekend. If you wanted to use the toilet you had to walk though the kitchen and get in the stewards way Also had to ask for the toilet to be cleaned as it was disgusting. Again our well travelled daughters commented that this was the worst flight they had ever been on food awful and hard to get a drink. Would not willingly use this airline again.
3794,"Overnight flight from Vancouver to Manchester on an old airbus was probably the worst flight and airline my wife and I had ever been on. In flight entertainment was a single screen in the centre of the aircraft. Sound quality was atrocious with interruptions deafening static. My wife's was non functional anyway. Food was dire and by the time our turn came the main meals were gone and we had to have the vegetarian. No apology just this is it. Tray was practically thrown at us (including breakfast). Rudest cabin crew ever - they kept knocking my wife's seat without apology and when one deigned to speak said ""oh has that never happened to you before"". The lights were never dimmed for an overnight flight and the only sleep we did manage was interrupted by the duty free selling pre-empted by the usual seat bumping. This is the first and last time we would use this airline and would not recommend it to anyone. Old aircraft and rude staff - never again."
3795,Kuala Lumpur-Incheon Airport. Food was cold. Cabin crew sometimes rude when called. Seat space was really small. The seat across is 3-3-3 despite being A330-300 aircraft which should have 2-4-2 seat seating. Inflight entertainment was limited.
3796,Flew from SYD-KUL return. Was quite happy with them on the first leg apart from the poor airport at LCCT on the return leg they changed the rules for cabin baggage denying both of us a second carrier bag allowed onboard. Very disappointing and rude ground staff. Very poor organisation. On the same flight staff failed to secure toilet doors before takeoff so they swung open abruptly. I'd avoid flying them again.
3797,Flew LAX to DCA. Delay leaving LAX due to air traffic congestion but was kept informed. The seats were pretty uncomfortable considering this was a 5+ hours flight. I was very glad that I purchased a 'comfort seat' alongside as I was coming off a 15 hour flight from Australia and had space to spread out. The cabin crew were lovely and most helpful. We had a strange delay in DCA as we arrived 2 hours late due to earlier delay and adverse weather around DC and the Alaska gate was taken by another Alaska plane and we ended up waiting around 30 minutes on the tarmac for space to be found. Would use them again but would definitely purchase the comfort seat for added space.
3798,We flew as a party of 2 from London Heathrow to Naples changing at Milan Linate. On all 4 flights the cabin crew were just adequate with friendliness. There was no information about transfer instructions when reaching Milan we had to find it out ourselves. You have no choice of an alcoholic drink only tea/coffee or juice and the cups are small and only half filled and you only get given a very small bag of biscuits. I know they are only short hall flights but as a frequent flyer with BA we are offered a full range or food and drinks. Bags arrived where they should have but would not fly with Alitalia again.
3799,KUL-TSN-KUL. Very comfortable flight however the that FA was rude and unfriendly. The pre-booked meal was very small and not tasty. Overall value for money.
3800,Bangkok to Singapore on 30/1/13. Easy check in at Don Muang airport and was given an aisle seat as requested. Friendly airline staff and a good selection of food on sale. A little different to the grumpy lot on my next flight on Qantas from Singapore to Sydney.
3801,Upon our arrival to Rome from JFK on May 7th we were notified that Rome Airport was closed to outgoing traffic. The Alitalia representatives were very disorganized. Different representatives dispensed different information at the Rome Airport. As a result of the Terminal 3 fire at Rome Airport we were only offered water during our 39 hours at the airport. We waited 4 hours on line to get airline tickets to Turkey and as a result missed a wedding that we were supposed to attend we never got to attend. We had to eat all our meals at the airport in addition to trying to sleep at the Rome Airport seriously would consider not flying Alitalia in the near future.
3802,The last time I flew Air Asia was when I returned back from Medan to Surabaya. It was a very long flight for an Indonesian domestic flight. More than 3 hours. It supposed to be a good flight but due to a delay my flight departed in the evening and I was devoid of scenery as it was dark. Seat pitch was not great for a flight longer than one hour. I had a mixed feeling over the food. The fried rice was terrible but the satay was great.
3803,Flew from Los Angeles to Anchorage on Alaska 149. The flight left and arrived in destination on time. The purchase food quality and quantity were OK. The drinks provided during the flight are more than adequate. The service was nice.
3804,"Flown on FCO-NRT and back in November 2014. For the first segment I was Economy Plus. Just a waste of money. So no need to waste also time in reviewing it. On the way back I asked on board the upgrade against 800?? The seat is a real lie flat but somehow is feel a bit cheap and ""fragile"". The mattress is also a bit hard and is very uncomfortable for tall people the foot space that is very narrow and requires a lot off efforts to turn your body on the other side.. The grey design doesn't help as well: a bit boring. The amenity kid is just ok. The entertaining system is fine even thought he selection of film is not as nice as on other higher level airlines. The food is the only nice point: different choices of antipasti first course second course and dessert offered you on a tray: you can even taste a bit of everything. Also good selection of wines. The disappointing thing is professionally and the level of the service. I won't comment the ground customer service that is just shameful: nobody knows nothing or would better to say everybody gives you info that most of the time is just a personal guess. On board the service is a bit improvised and basically depends on the individual character of the attendant: if he/she is a nice one it all be nice. On the opposite if bad will be very rude. In any case it is unprofessional as there is clearly a luck of training and service minimal standards."
3805,Toronto to Athens May 26/13 - Checked in online a few hours before flight. No good seats left (our fault due to late check in) check in at airport went off fast and effortlessly. Older plane with no individual screens. Row 27 (middle) right at the washrooms. The meals (3 choices) and service were good. Seats were comfortable enough. Entertainment was fair. Return was the same style of plane (Row 24 window this time). No individual screens. Meals (3 choices) and service were good. My only complaint is Air Transat really should be using the newly configured planes for all the long haul flights over 6 hrs. It would make the very long flights more enjoyable.
3806,LGW-KUL return. On the outbound leg we had the hot seats which have plenty of legroom but I found the middle seat I was in agonisingly narrow the tray table is built into the armrest leaving me feeling wedged in and very uncomfortable. If you are of larger build you will find that the regular seats with armrests that fold up are much more comfortable. A340 both ways were clean and in good order but both legs ran slightly late. Crew 'okay' nothing more. Food pretty poor and along with drinks even water have to be paid for. Remember cash or you'll be having a very thirsty flight! Return leg much more comfortable as we sat near the rear in the two seats together where the cabin narrows in regular seats.
3807,Numerous flights REP-KUL KUL-HKT HKT-KUL KUL-SGN. Experiences differ at each airport but check-in and boarding was smooth. Nice leather seats and although not a lot not bare minimum legroom. Good selection of food and drink (which was very cheap). The satay chicken was quite oily however the tandoori chicken wraps were nice. Every flight was on-time if not early. The Kuala Lumpur LCCT is a bit old and grubby but then again you do have to expect that when travelling low-cost.
3808,Athens to Roma in Economy. Boarding was good but it turned rather bad once on-board. A women who decided that she wanted a window seat even though she did not have one just sat in one. This than created all kinds of drama. The mans seat who's this was asked her to move and she refused. He called a flight attendant and even she could not get her to move. She was glued to that seat and that was that. So the man had to move seats but he was with his wife and they wanted to seat together so all up 3 rows were shuffled to accommodate this women who wanted a window seat. Why the flight attendant just didn't move the original offender is beyond me. Once underway all was good. Short flight so no entertainment and a simple drink and nuts. Luggage was out quick in Roma.
3809,Flew from Miami to Rome and back in March 2015. Most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced on an airplane. The permanently attached head rest actually pushes your head/neck forward . Flight was too warm on return and even though 11 hour flight water seldom offered. Little English spoke by flight attendants. Very difficult to check in online if you purchased on Delta Airlines website.
3810,Flew LAX to Rome Premium Economy on May 7. Overall a very poor product. Does not compare to other International Premium Economy offerings. Poor service lousy food and limited inflight entertainment options. So far no improvement in quality at this airline. I would not fly them again. Flight attendants go missing for hours.
3811,My wife and I have just returned from a holiday in Canada. This was our first trip to Canada which was great and our first experience of Air Transat which was not so great. Unfortunately my wife is Coeliac so therefore needs a gluten-free meal. Despite having requested and received confirmation from our travel operator that gluten free meals would be provided on both the outward bound and return flights these did not materialise. At the Air Transit check-in desks we asked the attendants if the requested gluten-free meals were on board and both times we were told no. One individual even suggested that we should just go and buy something. It is time that Air Transat and in our experience most other airlines take these requests seriously and act responsibly.
3812,On the outgoing trip from Toronto to Gatwick all was well we got bumped up to Club class. Return trip was not so good. We flew home from Glasgow on one of the ancient A310's the staff were very good but the plane was cramped. We did not have individual screens for the entertainment on a flight that long passengers should have a choice on what to watch. The food was awful I am not even sure what it was they served. It's time Air Transat got rid of those relics and updated their fleet.
3813,Overall not a bad flight. On return audio speaker at airport was not clear enough to hear what they where saying. They should call passengers at rear of plane on first so they don't have such a backlog of passengers waiting in the rain on the tarmac. Extra charges for DVD player food drinks and blankets etc is I suppose why it is a low cost carrier.
3814,KUL-HND-KUL. There are Japanese Flight Attendants to assist non-English speaking Japanese passengers. Food was the standard AirAsia X fare although the timing of the service was not convenient for me (I just had lunch when we departed from KUL-HND). There was no problem delaying the food till later though. Luggage delivery at Tokyo Haneda Airport was a little slow - it took about one hour after arrival before we were able to leave the arrival hall. On the return flight the check in and boarding was very efficient and problem free. If not for the luggage delay and unfriendly time of arrival (10.30pm) at Haneda AirAsia X would have gotten a 9 rating from me.
3815,My trip was from Montreal Pierre-Elliot-Trudeau to Puerto Plata Dominican Republic. I had to fly what I thought was the oldest Airbus A310. The seats were okay if you're under 5 ft 10. Being over 6ft I thought it lacked some room. The in-flight entertainment was poor an old and boring movie. The food was bad but typical of what you normally get on a plane (barely enough to get you alive in fact). The departure wasn't on time in Montreal we lurked around the airport for more than an hour for some reason. The staff is fair. Would recommend if you're poor and stingy like me. You can have better if you pay more to another airline.
3816,ORY-KUL in Economy. Flight was turbulent but the captain kept us informed several times during the flight. Flight attendants were polite friendly and always smiling even when flooded with in-seat calls. Pre-paid food and snacks of excellent quality surprised considering it's a low-cost airline.
3817,Melbourne to Singapore with a stopover in KUL. Plane was clean with comfortable lighting. The seat's pitch is not a problem but the issue lies with the amount of shoulder space between passengers. There is just not enough space if you have broad shoulders. The seats are comfortable for smaller builds only. I had to lean on one side throughout my 8 hour flight. The poor quality padding starts to present itself about 2 hours into flight. The toilets are very clean. The sandwich taste good on both legs. The attendants are friendly but firm. I can see why it is the best low cost airline because it does offer the best value. I personally would prefer more space on long haul flights. Again what you pay is what you get.
3818,FCO-AOI-FCO and FCO-PSA-FCO. The flights to and from Ancona operated with an A319 instead of ATR-72 as scheduled which was too big for such a short route and in fact it was quite empty. On the flights to Pisa Alitalia uses Etihad Regional's ATR-72 that's a very nice and comfortable little aircraft appropriate for this route. Cabin crew professional the food service is pretty much the same used on European flights.
3819,YYZ-FCO-TLV in economy. After reading some of the reviews here I expected a terrible experience. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The aircraft on the YYZ-FCO leg was a refurbished A330-200 with personal entertainment systems and decent seat pitch. Flight left a few minutes ahead of schedule and arrived on time. I rated a vegan meal (VGML) which was surprisingly good and nutritious and ample drinks were offered including wine. Staff spoke good English and were alright not the friendliest I've had but sufficient. The 3 hour flight from Rome to Tel Aviv was on an A319. Busses took us to the remotely parked aircraft and we departure about 30 minutes late. Nevertheless arrived on time. Food was served on this short flight which was surprising; cold appetizer but you definitely can't complain! Staff was actually friendlier on this short leg. The slim leather seats weren't very comfortable but alright for a short flight. Overall excellent value for the $800CAD round-trip. This may not be the best airline I've flown on but definitely not as bad as I thought. Bottom line - will fly them again.
3820,I am of Italian background and live in Scotland. I decided to take my elderly mother-in-law to Italy for a holiday. We had an efficient and friendly flight with BA from Edinburgh to Heathrow where we connected to Alitalia. The contrast between the friendly BA staff and the rather surly and unhelpful Alitalia staff was shocking. While our flight to Italy took off with a minimal delay the service was minimal with only a snack served and a murky tea. We had to transfer in Milan for a flight to Naples and pass through chaotic 'security'. I was not impressed at all with the internal Alitalia flight as the staff seemed only interested in exchanging gossip over passengers. My mother-in-law requested a glass of water and was ignored. Certain so-called no frills airlines offer a much better service than Alitalia. I felt ashamed that the flag carrier of Italy could not do better.
3821,Booked in August 2012 to fly from Manchester to Toronto in May 2013 for our honeymoon. Air Transat called in March 2013 to inform us that our Manchester flights had been cancelled and we could only fly from Gatwick on those dates. No apology was given no offer of compensation or even transport to and from Gatwick. We were then offered alternate dates to fly to from Manchester which we took. Upon check in at Manchester it became apparent the seats we had booked had been changed due to the change in dates after some discussion we were offered extra legroom seats for free which were excellent. The flight took off and landed on time it was an old plane with shared screens playing videos during the flight. The food was edible and came with a very small glass of wine. The return flight which was also on time was a refurbished plane with new leather seats and personnel touch screens. If they hadn?™t cancelled our flights I would have given them an excellent rating for the price but I would not trust making expensive holiday arrangements that rely on one of their flights again following this experience.
3822,I thought they did fine until it came time to leave Cancun. The bus trip which was also organized by Air Transat was only supposed to take an hour and a half which ended up taking 2. After being late to get to check in I was told that I would have to either return to the back of the check-in line to remove my camera bag or pay $30 extra. I was told they would not check my luggage if I attempted to remove anything at the counter. When I questioned their logic and explained the situation with the late bus I was given a sneer and a sassy comeback. So all in all it left a bad taste in my mouth about them.
3823,Incheon to KL roundtrip. I made a date change by phone and was told to pay at the airport. On arrival at the airport no change had been made. Forced to pay a higher fee to fly the day of the flight. Staff were polite but all seemed rather ill-equipped. I've flown Air Asia many times and found them fine for short flights. Once you pay for bags a blanket pillow and food on board the ticket price is about the same as any other carrier.
3824,Flew Economy CHCH to KL and then lie flat return. Economy seats are very small and the head-support is poorly designed. Staff are very nice. You can buy almost everything you need food drinks blankets pillows duty free. There is no technology but you can rent a DVD player. I would suggest you take your own food and ipod. Lie-flat is very good. It's on a tilt but just put a pillow or blanket under your legs and it's fine. You get a basic meal and water bottle included. Despite limitations it's good value and they are upfront about their services.
3825,CHC-KUL-CHC (Premium and Economy). A330-300. Overnight flight in both directions. Premium seats excellent and comfortable enough to get a good sleep. FA's gave out duvets and pillows. Food same as Economy and was tasty. Would take own food next time. Return journey in Economy. Seating configuration 3-3-3 was tight. Seats were narrow and didn't seem to recline very far. However service was good and for the price was more than acceptable.
3826,I found the service to be friendly enough but a little distant especially considering how many there seemed to be on our flight. The food was not great palatable is probably the best I could say. Flights left mostly on time although we were held up for 1 hr in Kuala Lumpur waiting for a passenger to get through immigration.
3827,Bandung to Pekanbaru on 9th December. At the time I bought the tickets scheduled for 3.40 pm but 3 days prior to departure the schedule suddenly changed to 5.35 am. A very disappointing change.
3828,We travelled from Tokyo Narita to Sapporo-Chitose on 22 Dec. Air Asia is the usual low-cost routine - a separate terminal with no facilities bus out to the plane at the far end of the airport tight seating and generally a joyless experience. Since when did air travel become so bland and so unexciting? Our biggest disappointment was the Air Asia terminal/departure lounge at Narita airport. Once you enter after check-in you cannot leave and there are no facilities except a toilet and a small shop. We felt trapped and stuck there in a facility that resembles a hospital waiting room. This in a busy and interesting airport with an array of shops cafes etc but we were stuck in this waiting room with no forewarning and no way to leave. Anyone checking in 3 hours in advance as requested would be well advised to time it to the last minute before going through security as this departure lounge is a horrid experience. I would also add looking at the ticket prices which creep ever upwards that the only thing cheap about low-cost travel nowadays is the way you feel after using it.
3829,Flew on Flight 447 from LAX to SEA. Codeshare with Qantas. Plane was modern but interior looked dreadfully tiresome. For a low cost carrier their seat pitch was amazing. Cabin crew friendly and engaging with passengers. Besides the typical buy-on-board they give you something for your metabolism and non-alcoholic beverages are complementary. I ordered one of their buy-on-board but the crew forgot to serve it to me even though they have charged my card and all. Thus they ran out on that option after serving it to all the other passengers. Cabin crew's apologies were sincere and they did their best to make it up for me.
3830,Rebooked onto Alaska due to cancellation of my original flight on UA from SEA to LAX. The aircraft was pretty worn (737-400) and the IFE non-existent. The legroom was frightening. Once the pax in front of me reclined my knees were against his seat for the duration. Cabin crew were good and service was perfunctory. However I could've done without the 5 minute announcement ploy for their credit card and corresponding benefits (not to mention the FA walking down the aisle with applications). Got me from point to point but I have to say I wasn't really that impressed.
3831,JFK-FCO. Check-In at JFK was a complete hassle. The agents were friendly but they were completely oblivious to what a Schengen Visa meant. Anyway once on board everything was fine. Brand new A330 with comfortable seats. Recline and legroom was decent although it did feel very tight once the person in front of me reclined. Entertainment options was decent and they had some recent movies as part of their selection. My only complaint is that the screen was extremely unresponsive. Food was average ordered the Seafood Meal and it was delicious. The pre-arrival snack was a disappointment it was literally the same tuna salad served as the side during dinner but slapped between sliced bread. Crew was professional and efficient but were not warm or friendly. Only complaint in terms of service is the lack of beverage runs during the flight. They seem to be too worried resting in their crew rests area (at the back of the plane) and even turned off my service call without asking me if I needed anything. Appalling. Overall a decent product but I would fly on another airline for better service but they're not as bad as people perceived them to be.
3832,Made quite a few flights with the airline the new refurbished fleet definitely makes the flights better. Check- in staff are good FA's are usually nice. The meals are good. I still feel like they could give more legroom the long haul flights are really tough to sit through. The TV features movies and TV shows and in the refurbished planes its in the seat in front of you.
3833,MEL-KUL-MEL I have flown Air Asia many times within Asia and decided to give Air Asia X a go. My wife and I picked up tickets for A$400 return each very reasonable. A bit disappointed when we left 2 hrs late as someone was aboard in Melbourne with out a ticket and the FA had to count all PAX several times. Captain made up time and we landed 45 mins late. The seats are great if you are of a small build but I found the seats cramped. Nil inflight entertainment Inflight meals were standard airline food. I would fly AirAsiaX again if the price was right.
3834,I am an Alaska Gold 75K and due to all the flight time I am seeing an increasing amount of maintenance holds delays and flight impact due to demand maintenance. On a flight from SEA to PSP that was on gate hold for 30 minutes due to a cockpit printer malfunction. The pilots PA circuit also malfunctioned with very loud audio noise in the background that made his communication to the cabin almost inaudible. Given the monthly frequency of gate hold maintenance events I am seeing as a passenger I am concerned about the competency funding and oversight of their maintenance program.
3835,We travelled as a group of 2 couples from Toronto to Punta Cana in early February. In spite of the stormy weather flight was only delayed for 90 minutes and that was due to de-icing the plan. Seating was cramped and leg-room was sparse. Service was friendly and food was served efficiently. Return one week later was much better. The plane was larger and the seats were wider and provided extra leg room. Only one option for food by the time that the servers came to our seats. The in-flight movie was poorly timed and had to be shut off before the end to prepare for landing.
3836,LGW-YYC return. 2 hours late leaving LGW due to water leak on time returning. IFE good food very average my wife had no main meal on the return as vegetarian choice had run out. Not impressed by the 3-3-3 seating. Cabin crew very good both ways. We had these flights as part of a tour so no choice of Airline. They would have to be very much cheaper than AC or BA to be our first choice.
3837,Took a Christmas flight from London to Vancouver. This is the second time I have flown with the airline. I travelled on a newly refurb plan. I travelled with my family and we had a baby and paid additional money for the bassinet seat at the front. I really can't say one nice thing about this flight. The lighting is awful fluorescent mood lighting which appear not to work and was directly over the bassinet no method to dim. Seat arms are solid and could not be lifted up (unique to the front row middle) which is crazy. In addition all the galleys have been removed so there is one at the front and back with just row after row of seats. I fly a lot long haul and typically you have some space to stretch your legs or stand around. Not with this config. Food - rubber pasta with cheese sauce - this was not even edible. One positive point is they are cheap you do get what you pay for.
3838,Travelled in a group of 40 KUL-CNX on 29/11/2012. Upon arrival to LCCT the crowd at LCCT was horrendous especially during holiday season. However we managed to check in our luggage within an hour thanks to efficient ground staff who was at the counter alone. CNX-KUL on 2/12/2012. Chiang Mai airport was much more less crowded early in the morning it was only AK flight at that time but were surprised that the check in procedure took more than an hour! There were one lady at front counter one at the back helping to cut the e-boarding pass and stick the stickers to the check in luggage. We should have been checked in as a group and not 2 by 2! My question is what if there are 3-4 groups checking in simultaneously? Some could miss the flight?
3839,"Phuket-Chiang Mai Economy. Air Asia is riding the budget airline wave and doing a reasonable job of it. We ordered some food when we booked (Pancakes and Satay) which turned out to be decent. Everything went smoothly and on time. My only grief was how tightly packed the seats are onboard. I'm 6'1"" and used to being a bit squished on airlines. These seats were the worst I'd ever been on without question. In our case the flight was a little over an hour and we had the row to ourselves to spread out. I would never book this airline for longer legs with more passengers."
3840,"I took a round trip flight from Rome to Miami. The flights were the worst in terms of seat comfort and food. The so called ""head rest"" of the seat has made the flights very uncomfortable. The legroom was very short and on top of that there was a metal box on the floor occupying my foot room. I have never seen anything like this before! I will never take an Alitalia flight again!"
3841,FCO-LHR-YVR. This was my third time flying with Alitalia and would be my last. The first two trips were uneventful and encountered many of the same issues listed in various posts: surly unhelpful staff dirty old planes malfunctioning toilets etc. Yet we were able to get from Point A to B safely and within reasonable delays (
3842,"KUL-ORY with AirAsiaX A340-300. The flight was on-time and 95% full. The seat would be more comfortable if it's an inch wider no problem with the 32"" seat pitch though. For the lower fare you get what you pay for. 2 round of hot meals came with 350ml bottle water each food delicious and spicy (Asian meal) but the portion is very small. Water can be purchased onboard for a reasonable price. Cabin crew doing a good job overall."
3843,Several flights with AirAsia X and AirAsia March-April this year and considering price paid reasonably happy with the service provided on A330 and A320 aircraft. Pre booked food was fine seating okay on A330 and reasonably good on A320 aircraft. Most flights on time or close enough to not be a problem - so for a budget airline no issues.
3844,Night flight from DMK-KUL last week and the flight was delayed 45 minutes. This week my friends took flight to SIN and CGK (both were from KUL) and both flights were delayed for 45 and 40 minutes. They had to pay midnight charges on their return trip from the airports not to mention the normal hassle when you got delayed.
3845,Having found a promotion fare from CNX-MFM I thought I would try the latest destination out of Chiang Mai. I was interested to see why they gave up Singapore in favour of Macau. It quickly became apparent as most of the pax were in a tour group from mainland china. Standard Air Asia service although this time I booked a hotseat and had a nice chicken lasagne. Flight was 30 mins early. No jetway at MFM but the walk in fact makes getting to immigration easier. Next to the airport is a new jetfoil service to Hong Kong.
3846,ATH-FCO-LHR. LHR-FCO-ATH. Cabin crew stood chatting and ignored passengers as they boarded. After snack was served the cabin crew disappeared. Only biscuits for snack at the return the coffee was cold probably from previous flight. No entertainment in cabin.
3847,I have always flown with Alitalia. This is the second time I flew on a 777 and the seats were absolutely hideous. The headrest pushes your head forward making the long journey painful. I couldn't help but notice all the other passengers many were trying to lift or lower the headrest with hopes of making the seating more comfortable. That did not happen. I also would like to spend a second and mention the food. I never have expectations on the food it's not so important for me but this last flight I took with Alitalia the food was very poor and very little of it.
3848,We flew from Calgary to London Gatwick. The plane was old the seats were cramped and my seat had no working entertainment I had no music no movie no reading material. Sleep was impossible and we flew over night. The staff tried to help no but one returned to say if the entertainment could be repaired at my seat. Finally they told me it did not work but I could move - away from my wife which is not acceptable to me. I have never been so relieved to reach a destination. My patience was wearing thin. Never again.
3849,We flew with our 7 year old daughter from London Gatwick to Toronto on January 10 2013. This was the last leg of our World Trip and we had travelled on 9 different airlines as we travelled around the world and were now heading home on a Canadian carrier. Terrible! That is the word to describe the rude service of the staff on board. The airline claims it was voted as the number one Leisure Airline in the world. How can that be? They charge you for everything on board and when you ask for something the first thing they tell you is that there will be a cost involved. Enough already! We know just sell me the item I ask for. I will never fly with them again.
3850,"Having checked online for Yangon to Bangkok it just remained to have documents checked at the appropriate desk. 50 minutes later still waiting. They allowed passengers with checked luggage to use the same line and then a tour group had problems with documentation. Instead of asking them to stand aside to fill in the documents they let them block the line. The supervisor said ""you could have joined another line"" - yes at the back again!"
3851,Absolutely awful service. I missed a flight to Honolulu for business because my connecting flight (also an Alaska Airlines flight) was 25 minutes late arriving. I got to the departure gate for Honolulu in time to see the plane sit there for a few minutes before pushing back if only they have held the plane 5-10min so me and the half dozen other connecting passengers could make the flight. Worse yet they offered no hotel or even club accommodations even thought this was the last flight out and it was entirely the airline's fault that we didn't make the connection?”service reps said it wasn't their problem since they were 'only' 20min late and blamed my booking. I'll never fly Alaska Airlines again.
3852,FCO-PRG on an A320. The check in staff were surly. The plane departed approximately 20 mins late but through no fault of Alitalia. The cabin cleanliness was appalling. The plane smelt dank in the bathroom. The service was variable with pretty poor cabin presence. There was no IFE and the seat was uncomfortable. The food (a packet of biscuits) was ok but the use of powdered milk with coffee was a big no no. There aren't really any advantages to flying Alitalia over a low cost airline- I wouldn't recommend it.
3853,We were re-booked on an Alitalia flight ex AUH to Rome on 04/01 due to the 'fog chaos' at AUH on 03/01 and the subsequent missing of our original booked Etihad flight AUH-BRU. The Alitalia business class on their A330 is quite similar to Etihad's. The plane was clean IFE system decent. The biggest disappointment however was the crew and their (non) service. The welcome drink which other airlines offer business class passengers when they are installed at their seat was offered when the plane was pushed off the gate more than 1 hour after boarding (we had to wait for transit passengers from late incoming flights). Breakfast was offered 2 hours after departure without having seen any flight attendant whatsoever between take off and breakfast being served. Once the breakfast trays were collected the crew disappeared again and we just saw now and then stewardesses passing through the cabin as if they thought they were movie stars totally ignoring passengers. Even when the captain announced the descend till the landing itself the crew preferred not to appear did not bother to check if seat belts were fastened tray tables stowed away and seats were in upright position. Most window screens were even still closed when we landed which I believe is against regulations. I don't think I ever experienced a crew which had so few interest in its passengers. It was clear that we were regarded as an annoyance and just disturbed their chit chat sessions. No wonder this airline has been on the edge of bankruptcy several times and I'm surprised that their parent company being Etihad accepts this kind of attitude from their personnel.
3854,Flew Gatwick to Toronto on 7 Jan 2013 (TS623) economy. Flight was busy and left a few minutes late. Attendants were good and was food was for the most part edible. Plane did not feature their full entertainment - however it had USB charging facilities. Seats were a little tight (9 abreast on an A330) - but tickets were cheaper than other carriers. The outgoing flight (on 16 Dec) was on one of their refitted planes which offered better seating and entertainment although featured similar identifiable meat for dinner! Lights not fully dimmed despite it being an overnight flight - which was rather frustrating!
3855,CAI-FCO-MLA - both legs departed on time and arrived early. Tickets were a bargain compared to other airlines especially since it's a busy season. The biggest disappointment was the aircraft itself. Both legs were A319 with the hardest seats I have experienced. The pillows provided were wafer thin. On the CAI-FCO leg there was no IFE at all despite it being a 3-hour flight and there were screens installed in the seats. Not even a map or a shared movie. Service was ok and food was pretty basic.
3856,Saga began when I tried to book a seat several weeks prior to boarding. I went to the website and tried to follow the instructions but was unable to reserve a seat. Despite several attempts to do this over the next few days it would not work so I decided to go to the airport extra early (5 hours in advance of my flight). There were no aisle seats left despite me being so early so I decided to go ahead and book a ?œcomfort??seat for which I was charged an additional 85 euros. Onboard I get to my ?œcomfort??seat which is the aisle seat at the front right beside the washrooms. The aisle where everyone crosses in front of you. The man sitting beside me had also paid extra. His seat was ripped and the stuffing was coming out. He moved to the next seat over. Meanwhile people who had not paid the extra asked if they could sit in the other comfort seats (including the two by the window on each side which were much nicer and also vacant) and told that they could. We paid they did not they got better seats than we did. As we were taking off the air hostess told me to put my seat to the upright position I was surprised because I had not put it back. A few minutes later she told me the same thing. That?™s when I realized the back of my seat was broken. The man behind me was unhappy with this and spent the entire flight pushing on my back in an effort to keep my seat more upright. It would stay for a while and then a passenger would walk past and push on the back of my seat for stability and back it would go. The man would push me forward someone else would push me back - this went on for 9 hours. One of the bathrooms went out of order (the bathrooms beside my seat). The staff did not put an out of order sign on the door. They knew it was out of order because I told them. People kept lining up. I would tell them it was out of order. They would walk to the other bathroom on the aisle in front of me. I would pull my feet up to let them pass - one more strike against my ?œcomfort??seat. The man next to me was trying to work - every time someone walked past they hit his computer. He was very tall and got tripped over and bumped through the entire flight. The other bathroom at the front of the plane was put out of order. They ran out of toilet paper. I chose to avoid drinking for 9 hours so I could avoid the bathrooms. The plane was so old and decrepit. I fly several times a year for both business and pleasure. This was easily the worse flight I have ever been on.
3857,London to Toronto with a connection with Westjet to Winnipeg. The long haul flight was cramped with virtually no leg room - the person to my right was very tall and he had to lean over me to fit into his seat. The inflight entertainment was a little TV screen that showed an old movie food was not the best but to be fair all economy food is mediocre at best.
3858,UK-Calgary-UK. Seating cramped no water in toilets to wash on return flight. Wanted payment for pillow and blankets (credit card in CAN$ only). 3 hours late going out one hour late on return. Food mediocre service mediocre stingy on offering water and juice. Will not fly again with them and will not recommend them.
3859,KUL-LOP-KUL in October 2012. My first trip to Lombok Indonesia. Took advantage of the launch fares (RM 88) and can't complain about the price for a 3 hour 1200+ mile flight. LCCT was its usual mess but I have worked out my standard operating procedure so that I got to the departure hall in good time. Lombok international airport was a little better for departure but arrival hall clearance was slow. The flights were on time and uneventful. Typical AirAsia (AK) service.
3860,My main issue is the check in. Flight from SMF to PDX was on the small propeller jet. Those do not have overhead room for normal overhead luggage. But they don't tell you. Hence you are forced to tag bags at the gate and place on cart for checking just like regular checked bags. What if you had something temperature sensitive. It's stupid not to inform customers that the plane does not have normal overhead storage. On the return flight it took half hour to check bags because the airline was understaffed line oppressively long. If I fly Alaska again I will bring a backpack only that's sure to fit in the tiny overhead compartment. Tell us if we get normal overhead. That's all I ask.
3861,LHR-FCO on AZ201 and FCO-LHR on AZ208. There are no AZ staff at LHR T4 it is outsourced to a different company. Checking in with the machines was not easy - the touch screens are unresponsive and take too much time. Boarding pass is printed on a pathetic paper. As we had bags to drop off we had to queue in the bag drop off line which was huge. Only 2 people were serving the counter for the flight. Cabin crew don't care about actually providing service. As we walked onto the plane they were simply talking amongst themselves. LHR-FCO was uneventful but then again I did sleep the entire time. Old A320. No IFE. Poor interior. Had to wait ages in the bus at FCO to be taken to the terminal. FCO-LHR delayed 20 mins no reason given. Again flight uneventful. No IFE.
3862,Athens to Rome and Rome to Amsterdam. Nightmare. 1 Hour delay from Athens landed at Naples instead of Rome. Arrived at Rome 3 hours late waiting plus one hour in the aircraft for the stairs. Next flight the next day also delayed 2 hours to depart Nobody willing to inform us about what was going on no food at all. Rude crew.
3863,Cabin crew stood chatting and ignored passengers as they boarded. After snack was served the cabin crew disappeared. Crew never smiled or talked nicely to passengers once throughout the flight. Crew looked unkempt and not smartly dressed. Very unprofessional crew on the 4 flights I used. Terrible service. Announcements were inaudible and cut off mid sentence and pilot announcements could not be understood at all.
3864,GLA-YYZ and return a week later. Outbound flight delayed by 20 mins because of no-shows we were informed. Very hot cabin. Airbus A310 was full not much legroom in my middle seat. Service was standard smooth flight pilot pointed out Greenland as we flew over. Return was also full very chatty attendant who must have mentioned that we were going to arrive ahead of schedule in GLA about 10 times before take-off! Also informed that we were flying on the day of Air Transat's 25th anniversary. A bit more legroom this time (different A310 maybe?) again service was fine slept for a few hours and awoke to landing in fog in GLA smooth despite this. Transat are the only operator to fly this route direct and that's why I booked. Actually flew home a week earlier than originally booked and had to pay full price but this is explained when purchasing so can't complain.
3865,Air Asia may be a budget airline but do you really expect passengers to pay for the heating too! Travelled a few times now including long haul to UK. and have found all flights freezing cold. Had to purchase blankets - I know extra income - but shouldn't be necessary. Cabin crew inattentive don't seem to notice people pulling on coats or coughing and sneezing but happy to sit huddled in their private little enclave chatting all time. When complaining about temperature they don't seem to understand problem and just say captains responsibility and nothing is done. Won't fly with Air Asia again unless improvement in this matter - just thawing out now after last trip!
3866,3 hours delay on the flight Jakarta-Singapore. No information about what is going on delaying every half an hour. Horrible customer attention Service is awful.
3867,"The check-in at KLIA LCCT was chaotic. I took the 10pm flight from KUL to PEN on 27th August (after a very good flight on AirAsia Premium from SYD). I was already web-checked in with pre-paid luggage. The main check-in sign-board directed me to R52 - but when I arrived there it was closed even though I was exactly 2 hours ahead of departure time. Every queue was choked with people. I could not see any sign on the LCD screens for baggage drop-off. Every queue had the sign ""Excess Baggage Payment"" both on the board and at the start of the queue. I approached an usher who asked ""What time is your flight?"". She did not ask me ""Have you web-checked-in?"" and ""Do you have excess baggage?"". After about 1 hour I got to the front of the queue and dropped off my bags. After that I found out that I had been sent to the wrong queue. The was a queue for express luggage posted with a waist-high sign that had been hidden by all the queuing passengers. AirAsia is a real mess at LCCT. I have taken more than 50 AA flights including KUL PEN JHB SIN. KUL LCCT is shameful a disappointment to what is otherwise a great Low-Cost Airline."
3868,Given the quality and variety of Italian food beer and wine and Italian hospitality in general its surprising that the Italian 'National Carrier' steadfastly refuses to showcase anything positive about its home and culture. On any airline the quality of the crew is all important. I have persevered with Alitalia but no more. Crew do not assist with the boarding process hence it takes far too long to get passengers seated and flights are often delayed as a result. Once onboard service will not commence for 30 mins after departure. Nothing is available for sale (another opportunity missed). If Alitalia is to survive all of this needs to changed.
3869,KL3401/AZ0107 (AMS-FCO): I bought the ticket via KLM website as they are both members of Skyteam. The aircraft was an A320 which looks ageing on the seats and cabin layout. Service was very basic with the selection of salty snack or sweet snack and the choices of drinks were very little (arancia rossa/orange juice hot tea hot coffee or water/sparkling water). Crew were not very welcoming and seemed not to enjoy their job I also did notice that the crew did not pay attention carefully to passengers who have not opened the windows shades and fastened the seat belt before landing. In a sum Alitalia is not up to standard of premium airlines that they claim to be. Many rooms for improvements in order to compete with other regional airlines. On the bright side the landing was very smooth and we arrived earlier as expected arrival time.
3870,"We will not fly Alitalia again. Our flight last week from Rome to Toronto was a nightmare. There was no in-flight entertainment or outlets for charging ??on our 9 hour + 3 hour (on the ground while we were stuck on the runway due to ""safety checks"") flight. The seats were dirty my husband's tray table was filthy and sticky. I have a nut allergy and the snacks that were distributed all contained traces of nuts. Not a good experience at all."
3871,Flew Club Class from Toronto to Madrid. Sep 23/2012 back on Oct 15/2012. Booked Row 1 and despite what seat guru says it is a bulkhead both ways can't straighten legs. Service was fine. Even though we had booked direct Madrid to Toronto they changed schedule days before we left to have a stop in Montreal with a plane change. When we got on new plane our seats were taken by Transat crew going to Toronto which reluctantly moved. Frustrating to fight for your seat after a 8 Hour flight.
3872,MEL-KUL-BKK Return on AirAsiaX. The planes are relatively new they leave and arrive on time staff are efficient and friendly and ensure that safety standards are met. There could however be more variety in the hot meals offered. Most importantly the airlines provides value for money and offers very good promotional deals. The one problem however is the inability to provide transit services at KL's LCCT airport. You need to have at least three hours to make an Asian connection given the length of time it take to clear Malaysian immigration and to make your way back into the airport to check in for your onward connection. If transit facilities were offered the airline would be my number one choice for travel out of Australia.
3873,Flew SYD/KUL and the KUL/PHUKET return. All flights on time web check in was good and saved long queues at the airport easily checked bags in at Sydney that were checked all the way through. No food or entertainment this was expected so was not a problem. Travelled with our 4 kids ensured they had colouring in books iPods etc. Flight was fine at the end of 9 hrs flying they were ready to get off but behaved well without normal flight gadgets. Also took my own food on board was not stopped and didn't have a problem. Staff not very friendly and don't bother you at all. Overnight flight home tried for Premium upgrade was not successful very difficult to sleep although the flight did seem quicker at night. Would recommend as long as you realise it is a budget airline.
3874,BLR-KUL-REP. The seats are tight. If you are tall you're going to have a problem. On the short haul flights from KUL-REP it didn't bother me but from BLR-KUL which was little more than 4 hours being cramped was a bit of a problem. Make sure you weigh your bags before check-in. At the last minute I bought something which put my bag over by 5 lbs. I ended up paying close to $75 in excess baggage about the price of the ticket for going from KUL to REP. I learned you could pay before hand online for excess baggage and its more than 50% less than paying at the airport. Overall I didn't mind Air Asia for short haul flights - under 3 hours but will definitely fly a full price airline for anything long haul. I should also add that their set up at LCCT in KUL was a mess and their ground staff wasn't very friendly.
3875,Two domestic flights in the last half year. Two really bad experiences. First one in April 2014 Trieste-Naples- Trieste. Outbound flight cancelled due to the strike after several long phone calls Alitalia managed to put us on a flight to Rome. And that was their only choice. We had to find our own way to get to Naples at our own expense. The second one in October 2014 Venice-Catania-Venice supposed to be operated by Air One but later cancelled. We were informed by an e-mail about flight cancellation and it was necessary to call their call centre to be transferred to other flight (via FCO). Flight on the 24th of October form VCE to FCO delayed. Since there were lots of passengers for Catania and the fact that the next flight from FCO to Catania was full one would expect that Alitalia will wait for us ??but no the flight departed a few minutes earlier. Were transferred to the last flight which was again delayed severely. Finally landed after midnight. Cabin crew on all the flights with couldn't-care-less attitude to customers with one exception FCO to VCE AZ1483 2nd November operated by Alitalia CitiLiner ??professional and really nice everything done with a smile. But nevertheless never again with Alitalia there are now lots and way better possibilities to fly on domestic flights in Italy.
3876,Round-trip JFK to Rome on 10/5/2014 and we returned on 10/17/2014. Our flights were AZ 0603 and AZ 0610. On both flights the two bathrooms closest to us stopped working (did not flush!) shortly after takeoff. I am unsure of the remaining bathrooms - but half of the aircraft stunk all the way! They never locked the non-working facilities and never directed the travelers so people kept using those defunct bathrooms. It is inexcusable and apparently not a single event as it happened on both legs of the trip.
3877,2 days prior to my departure I received I voice mail message from Air Transat to saying I was being downgraded to Economy class from the club class seat I had booked and been confirmed on 6 weeks earlier. Told it was due to plane reconfiguration. They were offering a $230 refund even though the upgrade cost almost $400 and a seat in economy. However they only had 2 seats available the in the very last row of the plane. I had no other choice than to cancel my travel plans due to what I was being offered. I guess the airline thinks that because they are the only direct flight to Manchester customer satisfaction is not important. Next time I will choose another Airline even if it requires a connecting flight.
3878,We flew from Gatwick to Montreal on 1 Oct 2012. It was an old airbus. We were economy and for nearly 250 people 4 toilets were available as club class had their own. About two hours into the flight two toilets blocked and were unable to be used. Then another toilet blocked leaving just two toilets for all economy passengers. People complained as we had to queue and wait for nearly 20-25 minutes to use a toilet. Staff were pretty rude to a number of passengers who complained to them direct. It was agreed that the club class toilet could be used by those in economy. Our flight back we flew club class we checked in on 14 Oct at Montreal all seemed to be ok just as we were leaving the desk the operator requested our documents back again and removed two bar codes from them and put two others in their place. We asked if there was a problem with her doing this but she told us no all right now. We arrived at London Gatwick on Monday morning to find that all baggage we had thought was on the flight wasn't.
3879,Club Class Toronto to Paris Frankfurt to Toronto. I have no issues regarding the non-renovated A330-300 in which we flew Toronto to Paris - having two Club Class lavatories on this plane was very nice service and food were excellent and flight attendants great. Our flight from Frankfurt back to Toronto was one of the older A310-330 which was a complete embarrassment and insult to the whole Club Class experience. The condition of this old A310 has almost completely turned me off ever flying Air Transat Club Class again. For two passengers I paid a fair bit of money for the Club Class experience on this flight only to find that my headrest had become detached and was falling off the back of my seat. The armrests on both of our seats were worn bare and ripped from use looking tacky and shabby. The seat ahead of me was not secured properly and as a result had twisted sideways into my seating area. The seats were worn and uncomfortable for this 9 hour flight. Come on Air Transat! Not having power ports personal seatback video screens and air flow regulators is not acceptable when flying in this day and age. The shabby-looking cabins are not helping either.
3880,Jakarta to Singapore (QZ7782) and back (QZ7789) on the same day. No delays. The right Low Cost Carrier experience: no frills no food no leg room efficient.
3881,Singapore - Miri Miri - KUL. Cabin staff were more interested in themselves and each other than actually doing anything vaguely like serving passengers. A smile from half way across the cabin isn't service it is nice but that is all. The only good thing about AirAsia is the price. There was not even cabin staff ensuring passengers stored their bags for take off and landing properly.
3882,I was going from Chiang Mai to Bangkok and had a connecting flight from there to Copenhagen. I had nearly 6 hours to reach the connecting flight. Less than a week before going they cancelled the flight and rebooked me in a new one nearly 3 hours later. However this flight was delayed and I was too late to reach my flight. That meant I had to pay for rebooking and stay nearly 24 hours in the airport. I made a complaint to Air Asia but they would not pay because the delay was less than 2 hours. They could not see it as their problem that I was delayed more than 4 hours because of the rescheduling.
3883,PEN-SIN. Check-in was quick as I did not have luggage and boarding was on time. Departed 10 minutes earlier and arrived 15 minutes before schedule. Flight was good and flight attendants were polite but seemed tired as this was the last flight of the day. The only thing I find annoying is that you cannot change your ticket if your flight leaves within 48 hours. Otherwise Air Asia provide a good service which is better than some other airlines.
3884,Out of 6 flights on Alaska going from Santa Barbara to Kalispell Montana and back only one flight (S.B. to Portland) was even remotely on time. All the rest departed from a half to full hour after the scheduled time. This is the worst this experienced long time flyer has ever seen.
3885,October 10th from Rome to Toronto. We did not choose to fly this airline as we had bought tickets from British Airways however due to flight delays British Airways arranged for us to fly on Alitalia for the first leg of our trip. We were told incorrect information regarding seat availability and flight details from the Alitalia representative upon check-in and boarding the plane was a largely unorganized process which took well over one hour to complete. The plane was older (tube televisions down the center of the plane instead of seat-back screens) the cleanliness of the seats was sub-par and the sink in the toilet was clogged for the duration of the trip. For the first half of the flight the service on board was mediocre but acceptable however once dinner was served the service became non-existent. For 4 to 5 hours (on a 9 hour flight) the flight attendants hung out at the back of the plane and were deliberately ignoring the call button. If any passengers wanted a drink they were required to walk to the back of the plane and pour it themselves all while the flight attendants sat around talking and completely ignoring anything outside of their conversation. This expectation of self service is very inconvenient when someone with anything but an aisle seat would like a glass of water. I also wondered what passengers who require mobility assistance do in this situation? Flight attendants ignoring their passengers for half of an international flight is completely unacceptable. I will not be flying Alitalia in future.
3886,London to Tel Aviv via Rome. The service was very bad throughout the flight and the main part of the meal provided consisted of cold turkey slices. There were screens on every seat but none of them worked. I wouldn't recommend Alitalia to anyone unless they change the quality of the flight experience.
3887,My husband and I travelled to and from Canada last month flights on time. However we found the seats very cramped and aisles extremely narrow. The food was poor complementary glass of wine amounted to 100ml. - with no top-up offered! It was not possible to tell the seniority of the cabin crew as no badges were visible and no distinction of uniform was evident. On our return journey which was overnight the lights were left on most of the time - not conducive to sleep. We have both travelled economy class before with other airlines and had better service than we experienced with Air Transat.
3888,Our many previous trips to Vancouver were via Canadian Affair and Thomas Cook flights. This year when six of my family over the space of a few days flew to Vancouver for our eldest son's wedding we used Air Transat. Paid for seats were changed return flights changed from direct to one stop and one flight cancelled all together. The staff on the way out were fine although the food was indifferent. On the return journey we queued almost two hours to check our luggage in. The meal which was served some 2.5hours after take off (touchdown in Calgary delayed this) was down to a choice of one by the time it reached us. It was something we didn't like and it was basically take it or leave. No offer of even crisps or chocolate instead. We had to wait a further six hours before getting a small croissant and yoghurt. The cabin staff couldn't have cared less. Will we use Air Transat again. A resounding no.
3889,KUL-STN-KUL and found the new Premium seats to be a bit of a disappointment. They are described as full flat bed but in fact they are still inclined at an angle so they're not horizontal which is what I had assumed from the name. A few of the seats at the rear of the old-style Premium class cabin seemed to have less of an incline than the new ones.
3890,STN-KUL-LGK return. They do what they say in the tin and nothing more. Trek out to STN was a pain. The check in was okay although why online check in isn't allowed on the STN-KUL legs I don't know. As I was travelling with carry-on luggage only this would have avoided the need to queue up. Onboard economy class seat was very narrow and didn't have much recline - I probably shouldn't complain as it's a low-cost carrier. However the price for my ticket was not much less than flying with Thai via LHR which would have been a lot more convenient & comfortable. The return journey was on time mostly although again there was no possibility of online check in which meant that I was queuing at the LCCT terminal in KUL for a good hour. I noticed that the flight to MEL was being served by one check-in desk only! The resulting queue was almost out of the building! Overall an okay airline but only worth it when you can get one of their deal prices.
3891,"I have flown Air Asia 8 times between CGK-SIN-CGK I have been on-time once. Regardless of price this is unacceptable. Each delay has been from 30 minutes to 3 hours and this is with good weather. I always pick a hot seat exit row. The pitch is fine but it's still tight. Crew's for the most part are friendly. They seem to be getting the Lion air attitude. ""Yea were late so what"". Anyway I'm heading back to Singapore Airlines. Yes it's more money but the delays are out of control at Air Asia."
3892,Flew from Bangkok (BKK) to Jakarta (CGK) on 27th June this year 2012. Paid for the trip by credit card now you have pay for the processing of the transaction. Every small thing is an extra now! The check in was fine but that was where it went downhill. Got to the gate 30 mins before boarding time and waited and waited the incoming aircraft had not even arrived yet. After another hour still no aircraft. What was totally unacceptable was the fact there was no announcement and no-one seemed to know what was happening I even suggested they call flight operations but they didn't. The flight eventually took off almost 2 hours late. Even though I had paid for a 'hot seat' the pitch is far from adequate and it wouldn't recline. Air Asia when they first started out were a good low cost airline and value for money but they have declined dramatically the prices have gone up and everything connected with the airline has gone down. I won't fly with them again!
3893,Flight from KUL-HAN was on time. The check in was smooth through until boarding. Aircraft's parked far away from our boarding gate. We walked more than 300 metres. Seat comfort and leg room are extremely poor. Staff were nice. However on our return trip from Hanoi a male crew was standing like a poster man. Neither instructed to ease the boarding flow nor helping a nanny who was holding her grandson to stow her hand luggage. Low cost airline shouldn't mean low cost in assisting passengers who need help.
3894,Departed on time from DCA bound for SEA on a 737-400 window seat 16 impossible to move in or out while other two passengers occupied their respective seats. The individual on the middle seat wore the most puzzling attitude making it absolutely awful to even attempt to exit for a loo break for the 4 plus hour trip. Blame the ludicrous spacing that makes it an absolute necessity to require other passengers to co0operate multiple times during a long flight. From SEA to JUN still a fully loaded aircraft yet uneventful and more pleasant neighbor passengers. JUN to final destination PSG a short hour long hop. A short 30 min delay at SEA. Return PSG by way of WRG then KTN imposed an hour an a half delay due not to weather. We arrived late night at SEA and then off to catch a ride to a local awful Seatac Inn for an overnight layover. Flight back to DCA was more pleasant. FA mobilized quickly to keep the full cabin stocked with minute free snacks beverages in cups and purchased meals. Entertainment was avail at 10 dollars for a shared small screen pad which battery quickly ran out of charge. The DCA to SEA is a long flight on a regularly cramped cabin. The spacing between seats is insufficient for a 155 lb. 6 ft. man to exit the window seat without interfering or annoying uncooperative passengers. It is difficult to hold biological needs for such long travel distances.
3895,I really wanted to like Alitalia as my husband and I had an amazing time in Italy and had great experiences with all the people we met there. However the service on our flight was horrendous. Firstly our plane had to be about 20 years old. There were large tube TVs that came down from the ceiling including one who's picture was always green and another who's rolling screen made it impossible to watch. This I can forgive as I know not to expect TVs on every seat on every international flight. What I can't forgive is the deplorable service onboard. No smiling no eye contact no please no thank you no your welcome. Nothing. They served a meal and one round of drinks. They only served half the plane coffee/tea then for some reason stopped. They stated drinks and snacks would be available for the duration of the flight. After the meal service we saw no one for a very long time we pressed the call button for a drink and no one came. Finally we saw a flight attendant walking by and she said we had to go to the back of the plane for drinks. So we walked to the back of the plane where it was passenger self service. Passengers poured their own drinks while the flight attendants sat two feet away putting on makeup and chatting. I asked for a snack one pointed to the top shelf. No trash was retrieved between dinner service and maybe 30 minutes before landing. The only positive is that we landed where we intended which I know is the most important part but when you are paying thousands of dollars on tickets you expect more. We will never fly this airline again and will share our experience to deter anyone we know from choosing it as well.
3896,STN to KUL return. Flights on time and check-in and ground services satisfactory. The flight attendants were smiling and helpful. All extras must be either prebooked or purchased onboard but I found prices fair and reasonable. The food was neither better or worse than most other carriers. One problem the seats are very narrow. They have 9 seats across (3x3x3) in an A340 and they have reduced the heights of these seats to give the impression that they are wider than they are. The outcome - you need to be very friendly with your neighbour. That being said if they keep their prices below their competitors I will certainly use them again.
3897,STN to KUL return on the new lie flat seats - on the outward leg the seat was broken although they offered to refund the cost of the outward leg. Return journey was comfortable. Disappointed with the portable e-player though. I feel the content could be better than a couple of films and several tacky US comedies. On the return journey I watched films on my laptop. Pre-booked food quality was OK but everything else had to be paid for although prices were reasonable. The lack of entertainment on board is the main drawback for AirAsia X although the new premium seats are as good as many full fare carriers and using Stansted rather than Heathrow a definite bonus.
3898,The joy that was AirAsia 10 years ago when I started flying with them is no more! On my last flight the problems were so bad I'm convinced this is no longer the way for me to fly even if its on a budget airline. I've already checked in and only needed to arrive early at the airport and then drop my luggage. Unfortunately for me the AirAsia check in system was down. This resulted in very long queues and after 40 long and uncomfortable minutes they resorted to manually check-in passengers and their luggage. While all that is happening they constantly announced about the failure and asked for patience but they continued calling passengers to board flights as if everything else is working. By the time I heard the boarding announcement for my flight we were still hopelessly stuck in the queue. When I approached a ground staff I was horrified to find out that the flight was to take off as scheduled! After at least 1 hour+ of delays thanks to their own check in system's outage I had to remind AirAsia's ground staff that we weren't late because of our own doing. Finally after some frantic phone calls and after realizing at least 50% of the flight passengers are still stuck in queues waiting to check in or to drop their luggage they agreed to delay the flight by 1 hour. Also if you have to board or disembark in KL's LCCT terminal when it's raining I think you will feel very differently about AirAsia - the experience is nothing short of horrible for passengers.
3899,Flight from SUB-BKK-HKT-BKK and KUL-SUB. The service was very bad and the crew very rude. I flew to Bangkok and then Phuket and always got a seat that couldn't recline because the button was broken seat pitch was also very bad. The Low cost carrier Terminal in Kuala Lumpur was very bad ground crew very rude to passengers. Don't use this airline you'll be very disappointed with its service crew and much more.
3900,Flew from San Jose to Fairbanks via Seattle. A good trip. Flight was on time. We knew no food was served so took our own. AA guarantee that if you don't receive your bags within 20 minutes of the plane arriving at the gate they will pay compensation ($20 I think). Our bags arrived within this time limit.
3901,Flew Naples to London RT. Will never use this airline again. Disorganized check-in. Not particularly clean plane. Terrible seats which were even worse than the usual bad airline seats.
3902,Just returned from Rome to Toronto. Never again! We have travelled extensively on many different airlines and this is the worst I have seen. The aircraft was old and dated. A few old video screens spread so far apart that most couldn't see - that's if you wanted to watch Spider Man 2. This was a 9.5 hour flight and we were served a tiny dried up pasta dish and a glass of house wine - not individual bottles like most have. The next service was 7 hours later a tiny dry muffin and the same little bag of crackers we had at dinner - no water service throughout the flight. The aircraft smelt and the wash rooms filthy. The guys next to me had a table tray that was cracked in two and his seat was in a permanent recline position. Couldn't check in online so had to bear the mobs and check in at the counter!
3903,AZ0610. Flew Alitalia yesterday Rome to NY. Bathrooms so filthy we tried to put off using them. Food was congealed. Saving grace was that plane was pretty much on time. Will search for another airline for our next Italian trip.
3904,We booked Club class for our trip to Italy September 7 2012 because of the added comfort level on a longer overnight trip. We were devastated by the transformation from the old Cub to the new Club class. The seats were very uncomfortable there were more seats added to the cabin and the service was anything but good. On the way home September 28 2012 we were treated to the old Club class on a plane that had not been refurbished. The difference was amazing - smaller amount of club seats much more comfortable and roomier seats with absolutely great service. Change is not necessarily progressive in this case it was just discomfort with poor service at a higher price.
3905,We flew from SGN-BKK return in June 2012. I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asia?™s office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you ?œuncheck??them. Boarding in BKK was a case of ?œfirst rush first aboard?? The flight itself was fine but the entire Air Asia experience leaves a lot to be desired.
3906,SUB-BKK then BKK-HKT-BKK and last KUL-SUB. The crew was impolite and unfriendly. When onboard from SUB to BKK and KUL to SUB I always found that my seat couldn't recline because the button had broken the seat pitch also unacceptable. When I was in the LCC terminal the ground crew were impolite and not responsive. This airline may be value for money but if you have heavy luggage this airline is not for you. AirAsia really disappointed me.
3907,SEA-ANC-ORD I consider my two experiences with this airline poor ones! The staff are friendly but flights are often delayed! On board crew seem lost this made me feel very uncomfortable these days you pay for everything extra when you fly them even for the bags. Won't be flying Alaska again unless the price is right.
3908,My husband and I travel at least twice per year on Air Transat of all the times we have traveled together there has been only once or twice that we have been seated together all other times I am seated either at the back of the plane my husband in front or the other way around. My husband and I just returned from Rome Italy on Sept. 8/12. We both speak Italian at the check in counter we asked if we could sit together and were told sure since we were one of the first to check in got the boarding passes did not look at the seat number assuming we were seating together when we got onboard we found out my husband had a window seat and I was seated across the aisle. So bottom line no matter if you pay extra or not you are not assured your seat selection. Is it to much to ask if anyone is travelling as a group / family to start their trip together.
3909,Booked the ticket from Montreal to Lisbon in Mid-March for a late August Flight. At the time there were much cheaper tickets with Air Canada and Lufthansa but since Air Transat was the only one with direct flights we opted for it. We even paid more for advance seat selection and leg room. Two weeks to our flight time we received an e-mail from Air Transat that our direct flight now has a stopover in Porto and our original flight time of 7.5 hours is now almost a 10 hour flight. We contacted Air Transat and told them that we are willing to stay an extra day in Lisbon and even pay for our hotel stay ourselves but come back with a direct flight the next day. Even though they had plenty of room in the next day flight they told us that we have to pay $150 each for the change and even that would not guarantee they wont change seats and schedule on us again. The reservation and operation staff were extremely rude and unsupportive. The flights were late on both departure and return flights by 50 minutes and an hour respectively. The plane was ok on our departure but on our return flight it was the oldest Airbus that I have ever seen with the smallest and most uncomfortable seats to match it. Unless the ticket price is very cheap stay away from this airline.
3910,"Never again will I fly with Air Transat. I purchased my ticket on June 26 to fly in club class from Toronto to Lisbon - flight taking place Sep 9 (direct). 2 days before my departure I received an e-mail stating that my flight was going to make a stop in Madrid. Explanation: charter companies can and will do that. Just be forewarned. On my way to Lisbon I also was - without prior notification from the airline - ""bumped"" since they suddenly did not have enough club class seats and was put into an economy seat. I found this out as I entered the plane and went to my seat. This is unacceptable. If they do not have enough club class / first class seats they should not have sold me this ticket in the first place."
3911,KL from OOL return. All I can say about this airline is that you get what you pay for. They do not give good service and they really couldn't give a stuff about me in KL. LCCT in KL is not a very nice place to stay at unfortunately I had booked a room at Tune Hotel for 2 days when I went over - even worse I booked it for 3 days on my return to KL - man what a mistake that was. I would advise anyone to spend the extra few hundred dollars and fly a full service airline. I booked the XL seats they were a waste small and uncomfortable.
3912,"We flew with Air Asia X from KUL to COO beginning of April. It was a new A330-300 the seats were terrible! The width of the seats is at least 5-10cm less compared to other airlines. The seat pitch was reasonable for a budget airline. However the seats could not recline besides the sliding option and the seat cushioning was terrible. I read that Air Asia X has received many complaints on the seats and will replace their non-reclining seats by ""regular"" seats. However if regular airlines are slightly more expensive I will choose them! Pre-ordered food was worst I ever had. Make sure you get something to eat prior to boarding! (or take food with you!) However drinks are reasonably priced and inflight entertainment is also OK."
3913,Flew from KUL-BKI on 27 May 2012. Service is awful. No direction whatsoever from the ground staff. Queue system was a disaster as there's no indication of which line to go to. The monitor didn't help at all and I have a couple going to KCH queuing in front of me and a group going to Kuantan behind me. What a mess. The staff at the check-in was busy talking among themselves while my flight is 40 minutes from departure. Went into waiting hall and straight directed to plane. End up waiting 40 minutes on tarmac because 2 gates opened simultaneously and the 2 planes are located on the same aisle. My flight end up with 2 passengers to Johor and it took them 40 minutes to find that out.
3914,BKK-CNX-BKK and BKK-DPS-BKK booked a year in advance for a bargain price during their annual promotion. 2 out of 4 flights were delayed by about 1 hour. Service onboard was good with friendly crew who were available throughout the flights. Seats were tight but bearable even for the 4.5 hour flight BKK-DPS. Baggage delivery was fast with less than 20 min waiting time on each sector. FD is nothing fancy you won't get pampered but if you can get a cheap fare and don't mind an occasional delay then Air Asia is the way to go.
3915,I am retired and am fortunate enough to fly first class extensively and often on a variety of airlines both in the US and Europe. I recently flew first class with my wife round trip from Las Vegas to Anchorage and plan to never fly Alaska again. Every employee I had contact with was pleasant and courteous the planes were on time but the only benefit in flying first was the additional legroom. The outbound and inbound flights were 2 weeks apart but breakfast both mornings was the same and only thing what they called eggs benedict with turkey ham which was on a piece of dry bread and was tasteless. Lunch was also one choice a chicken salad on a tiny salad plate with out bread cracker or chip desert was one piece of rolled candy. There was no TV on the leg of the flight to Seattle to Anchorage they provided a small hand held screen with a choice of 4-5 movies and short clips. I have never had such cheap and thoughtless meals on any of my previous flights. I would never recommend this Airline but if your required to fly it don't waste your money on first class.
3916,"FCO-BUD-FCO both flights delayed about 20 min. in Rome for heavy traffic and this is not an Alitalia's fault on the return from Budapest 30 min. for some ""uncommon"" luggage boarding procedures but we ended up landing in Rome only 15 min. past the scheduled arrive. Cabin crew professional and polite. Will fly Alitalia again."
3917,"Madrid to Montreal and then back from Toronto in August. Bought Option Plus but we were upgraded free to Club both ways. Club is really a ""quality economy"" in-flight service with a bigger seat. Slightly annoying IFS schedule on the way back - with a cold snack served something like 90 mins after take off making a decent block of sleeping hours impossible which is a killer on a transatlantic flight leaving at 11pm. Breakfast was surprisingly good however and rather well done although the airline doesn't seem keen on serving bread rolls. Complimentary drinks were a little thin on the ground on the return but staff were approachable and attentive both ways. Seating if a bit tired was fine too with good space. Never bother with IFE but it looked basic - overhead screens and that's that. Check-in via priority desk was instant outbound all went to time return delayed for an hour thanks to an unexplained non-existent plane. Luggage (tagged priority) came through very quickly at both Montreal and MAD T1."
3918,Flight on time old A310 seating very cramped no AVOD. Food quite poor service from crew OK but nothing more. Price of ticket not cheap but direct flight from YUL to LIS makes this service bearable and with some value.
3919,We travelled from Birmingham to Toronto in May in Club Class. The flight out was very good but on return the service was very poor. When the staff got to us they had run out of food options and we were told we only had the vegetarian option available. The attitude of the cabin crew was almost insulting and we told them so at the end of the flight.
3920,MEL-KUL Return. I initially paid $730 for the ticket but with the additional extra kgs and meals ticket price was close to $850 not that different price wise with MAS. Aircraft was new and clean seats and infotainment on each seats with USB food was delicious and service was good. MEL-KUL older A330 aircraft with no infotainment service generally good. Would fly again if price was cheap - happy to fly MAS or Emirates at a slightly premium price.
3921,Paid for allocated seats to Phuket at the cost of $150 received confirmation of these seats on boarding they just shrugged their shoulders and said the seats are already occupied. Not good enough spoke to customer service on our return and can not refund this is most unacceptable they have taken $150 from us and we did not receive what we paid for other then this service was good.
3922,KUL-HKT-KUL. Outbound flight was delayed by more than an hour due to late arrival of the plane as well as technical issues. Return flight was more pleasant and arrived about 15 mins early. It would seem that AirAsia is now deliberately splitting up passengers and seating them separately in order to encourage them to pay extra for advance seat selection. I witnessed a passenger frantically trying to re-arrange seating onboard so that his companion could be seated with him. My own companion was also seated across the aisle but we were not too bothered by that. We got excellent value for money because we booked these tickets about a year ahead at one of the sale promotions (Fare was US$ 45 return).
3923,My husband and I were scheduled to leave July 31 aboard Flight 621 headed for Rome. Plane was set to take off at 4.30 pm. It was late we taxied out on the runway and then stopped. It took the pilot 2 hours to tell us that we had mechanical difficulties. At 8 pm we were told that the plane could not take off. We were herded off the plane told to reclaim our luggage and told we would be put up at a hotel. Ushered to the sidewalk outside Bradley International Terminal to await a bus. For 90 minutes we were shuttled back and forth from one side of the sidewalk to the other. The Alitalia representatives were useless. We finally got on a bus to a Marriott Hotel we got there at 9.45 pm only to be told that there was no room at the inn and we now had to go to another Marriot. At 11 pm we arrived at the next hotel. The bus picked us up the next morning for our reschedule 11 am flight which of course was late. The plane was straightened out but the food sitting in their kitchen overnight was congealed. The crew were indifferent. We arrived in Rome at 8.15 am local time. Now if you have a plane-load of people delayed by almost a day many of whom have connecting flights wouldn't you think the airline would have spent some time going through the passenger list to make sure they would be rebooked onto other flights? We got off the plane only to find out that we had to reclaim our luggage once again. We were escorted to the ticket counter and left to fend for ourselves. It took us hours to book our connecting flight to Istanbul. As we made our way through the airport which by the way has no people movers or luggage carts we kept running into fellow passengers. Absolutely no help from Alitalia. We boarded a bus that would take us to our plane it was easily in the 90s outside and the bus had the heat blasting. No one from Alitalia noticed. Our flight was delayed. Of course.
3924,LGW-YYZ YYZ-LGW Staff were rude especially at the boarding gate. Flight was full very cramped and staff only came round at meal times to offer drinks there were no other drinks offered and the food was terrible. I was not satisfied with the service so will not fly with them again.
3925,KUL-MEL Pre-booked exit row 15 for a fee. First impressions were good. My seat had ample legroom. However the flight deteriorated and got tedious. Cabin crew were unprofessional could hear them talking in the galley with their crew curtain shut. They disappeared partially in the flight and recline was non-existing only glide. I also found the XCite touchscreen irritating. Online chat feature had a glitch that kept jumping the messages back to the top and touchscreen sensitivity was very inferior. Overall Air Asia provides value for their cheap flights and would recommend it only if fare is cheap.
3926,"STN-KUL on Air Asia ""Oakland Raider"" aircraft. Our window seats row 16 were dreadful no padding we were sitting on metal. Headrests fell off tray in front would fall open when the passenger in front moved and as you can imagine not very good when sleeping. Food okay. the portable entertainment things were okay kept you distracted on a long flight. I don't believe all seats were as bad as ours. I spoke to Air Asia who say that they would be refurbishing this aircraft. Can anyone suggest a row which the seats were okay? I only know to avoid row 16. I have also travelled many times with Air Asia on the smaller flights were the service was great and have no other complaints."
3927,SYD-KUL then KUL-SYD. Paid for full premium seats plus meals. Before leaving Sydney I called Air Asia to purchase my inflight entertainment and was advised that due to my seat being a premium seat it came as a package. As expected was not the case when I got on the plane! Disappointing 8 hrs! For the flight back I was advised that there were no entertainment units left to pre-purchase and every plane was only allocated 10! I can see value in economy but not in premium/business class.
3928,We flew from Sydney to Bangkok and then from Phuket to Sydney. Staff were so rude and were unable to answer any questions. There was no inflight entertainment. If you wanted entertainment you had to pay extra for e-books. However there were none available on our flight. Even people who had pre-booked them couldn't get them because they were out. There were 3 of us travelling and we did not get seated together even though we checked in together. A family on our flight were also separated. Our flights were delayed also. I will never fly them again. Pay the extra money and go with another company.
3929,LAX to DCA on May 23rd. Apart from one every other flight attendant was rude and scowled the whole trip. No greeting as we boarded the plane no follow through with promises to help provide first aid (or a simple bandaid after an injury) and no explanation for delays that occurred. The attendants seemed annoyed when customers asked for beverages when we were seemingly skipped. Overall this flight is miserable and the staff are far less pleasant than the attendants who work for foreign or even domestic airlines that I have flown with recently. Granted the lack of amenities on this older flight doesn't add much to the comfort of fl going across country but a pleasant attitude for the staff wouldn't hurt.
3930,"Round trip SAN/PVR April 4-12. Alaska's first is more of a ""light first"". Seats and legroom just so so. Same pasta dish on both legs served along side a small salad. No roll butter or dessert. Flight attendants on both legs were great they seemed embarrassed about the meal quality but kept drinks flowing and were very pleasant. Both flights on time. Travelled on BA award tickets."
3931,Had not flown Alitalia in years and was curious whether they had improved anything. JFK to Rome. I was not able to get a pre-assigned seat on the old and clunky web site. At the gate a bitchy attendant didn't let me on with my carry-on and forced me to check-in my business trolley. Plane was not full and there was plenty of room on overhead storage. Flight attendants quite unresponsive to extra drink/coffee requests. Seemed bothered by passengers asking more than bare minimum. In Rome waited well over an hour to get my luggage.
3932,Traveled this month on Alitalia Magnifica Class from Los Angeles to Rome. Flat bed seats were reasonably comfortable and due to cabin angle felt a bit more spacious but wear and tear was obvious and unappealing. Inflight entertainment system was not touch screen and was out dated not intuitive with poor picture quality. Bathrooms and overall cabin were out dated and need to be upgraded. Food was actually very good but service was unremarkable.
3933,MAN-YYZ return. Offered vouchers as overbooked on outward journey (Manchester to Toronto). Were told that they are frequently overbooked and look for volunteers to go a different day. Refused and checked in regardless. Airbus A330 both ways but not the same plane set up. MAN to YYZ - leather seats but no IFE. Good food and cheery cabin crew. Check-in line was long but moved swiftly. YYZ to MAN - Ridiculous check-in line with flights to Paris and Frankfurt also in same line (Why?) very very poor elderly looking plane needed refurbishing seats at the end of their life span. Ran out of food by my seat (43F). Both ways on time YYZ to MAN actually arrived ahead of time but was forced to wait for an airbridge. Only airline flying MAN to YYZ but aircraft both ways needed updating.
3934,Travelled in club class Gatwick to Vancouver on old plane had big reclining seats so legroom was great. Entertainment poor made to watch a single overhead screen showing kids movies - tedious for 9 hr flight. Club class on return trip in the newly refurbished air bus. Modern design of seats meant that although they were fairly big they do not recline! They sort of slouch forwards. I'm 6ft 3 and had a really uncomfortable trip knees and shins on the seat in front. British Airways premium economy next time for me.
3935,Flew from Toronto to Gatwick and back. Airbus A330 plane - small uncomfortable seats no individual entertainment system. The airline makes you pay to use blanket or headphone. Had a very noisy rugby team flying to London along with us whose antics added to my woes. As a vegetarian I got the exact same tasteless bland food while going and coming back. When I checked in at Gatwick for my return flight the lady at the counter surprised me by saying that only 5 kg of baggage was allowed as a handbag and that my shoulder bag now counted as an extra cabin baggage - a clear ploy to earn extra money. So my total cabin baggage now weighed in excess of 5 kg. So what did I do. I took out my jacket and put it on took out my e- reader and lo behold - my baggage now weighed less than 5 kg. So I was let in without paying any extra. All this hassle in addition to the fact that Gatwick is almost an hour long commute from central London which adds to your travel time especially when you have to catch an early morning flight.
3936,CNX-KUL. I've never used a low cost airline before but the alternative on this route involved a transit in BKK so I took Air Asia for convenience more than anything else. While the bag drop was slow and the food not that good the service was fine as was the aircraft a fairly new looking A320-200. The seat was comfortable enough for a 2hr 20min flight! The flight arrived just about on time and I was through the low cost terminal in 20min; I picked a seat paid for a 25kg bag and had food. The cost still came in 65% less than the other options on this route so no complaints and I would use again for convenience.
3937,We travel KUL-MEL almost once a month for business. Not happy with the booking system as it tries to sell you everything from Hot Seats to Baggage to Insurance etc. and every time we book we have to be careful to delete all these items as it gives you Hot seats to charge you more. Other airlines leave it to you to add on items you wan to purchase and this is more practical. They should make their booking system more User Friendly! Punctuality is ok and they have improved a lot over the years. Most of the staff are friendly.
3938,I flew with my wife from Thessaloniki to Rome and back. Both flights were delayed. Plane could be cleaner. As it is an international flight almost 2 hours the only thing you get is a drink and a small bag of biscuits. The coffee is awful. The staff could be more polite. The worst impression was on the return flight. We had only one suitcase which weighed 25 kg. Staff told us that we had to take 2 kg out because only 23kg was allowed. When we told her that we were 2 people but had only one suitcase much less than allowed (23x2 = 46kg) she insisted that we should take 2 kg out of the suitcase. So we had to open our suitcase at the airport. We will never choose this airline again.
3939,7/7/2014 ORD-FCO AZ0629. 17/7/2014 FCO-ORD AZ6028. I would never recommend flying Alitalia! Plane was very old. Plane was very dirty food all over floor when we boarded. Only 3 out of 6 restrooms were in working order and those were filthy. Not cheap tickets so I expect much more. Heard lots of complaints from the passengers so we weren't the only ones who were very disappointed.
3940,Flew Toronto to Cancun Aug 19 return on the 26th. Seats were very uncomfortable. They advertise a good seat pitch which is true however the width is terrible. There was something very uncomfortable about the angle of the seat. The value of the ticket was not worth it. Back to Air Canada or Westjet for me. Food was tiny portions and not very good even though it was free. Only one movie on an overhead screen is that not flying in the 90's? The airbus 310 was ancient both ways and showed it. Staff did not hand out Mexican immigration forms that caused a great deal of lost time for all 250 people on board at the airport. Every other airline I have flown on gives all the forms needed.
3941,From Gatwick to Toronto then Toronto to Gatwick. On the flight from Gatwick to Toronto there was a change in planes after we bought the tickets and because of this had two different sets of seat numbers staff at boarding were helpful during this. Flight was enjoyable but after we left the gate the pilot said that the entertainment system didn't work so for the first 4 hours of the flight there was nothing to do after they got the entertainment system to work there was a very poor selection of movies. TV screens are 10 rows apart and no individual screens. The food was inedible. The flight was delayed but we arrived in Toronto early. Now from Toronto to Gatwick to begin with we checked in staff seemed very friendly but didn't quite know what they were doing we stood at the check in for 10 minutes while the woman serving was talking to another member of staff. We took off because it was a night take off the lights went off then the reading lights began to have a mind of there own going on and off flickering on and off. It was about 1 hour into the flight before we were offered a drink the food was even worse this time. It was impossible to sleep as the staff come around every half an hour to offer you something. Then the lights went out and it was pitch black in the cabin until we landed the reading lights worked just then landing the lights came on and flickered on and off until we got to the gate. We waited half an hour to get off the plane when we got to the gate. Then the real fun began Air Transat had lost out luggage and we are still waiting for the bags. Other times I have flown with Air Transat we have had no problems. I would not recommend them anymore.
3942,My family and I flew BKK-KUL KUL-SYD. Awful experience staff were rude no attention from flight attendants whatsoever. Seating space limited on both flights. Have been much more satisfied when flying on other low cost carriers.
3943,Flew JOG-KUL-RGN. Do not spend money on hot seat or pick a seat. Since boarding announcements are in local language first passengers rushed to the gates especially in small airports where there is not a dedicated line for hot seat passengers. When I asked staff at gate if everyone had hot seats they said yes! Pay for hot seats if you want bulk head or emergency exit seats for leg room. At end of purchase the website will give you seat assignments so don't bother paying for pick a seat either. Airplane and attendants are average for low cost carriers.
3944,I flew to Las Vegas March 29th and returned April 1. First class round-trip $777. Service down was slow and we were served a cheese platter. Not a significant midday meal but it was sufficient. Returning was worse. Nearly an hour before cocktails were delivered. We were not served the cheese platter. We were served hot pasta in cheese sauce on a sad looking salad bed. I asked the Flight Attendant for the cheese platter instead as I heard them offering it to the coach passengers. She advised that I would have to pay for it. She was rude and smug. Apparently I can drink you dry of scotch but have to pay additional for a decent meal. In addition after being served our drinks another Flight Attendant came up to us and asked if we wanted our pretzel bags as they did not have enough to serve coach. I have been flying Alaska Airlines since 1973. This is the worst service I have received coach or first class. Flying 1st class is more than a wider seat. It represents a gracious and superior attention to the passengers for which a premium is being paid.
3945,Boston-Rome July 2014. Don't book extra comfort seats (this is not economy plus). The seats that are near the exit on the window sides are looking right into the bathroom. Food was bad but movies and drinks were fine.
3946,"Vancouver-Gatwick-Vancouver - The phrase ""You get what you pay for "" is right on the money for this airline. I am a small person and I felt very uncomfortable on this flight. My leg was touching the back of the seat in front of me. I wonder about those people that is 5'5 and above? The check in agent at YVR are the worst I asked if we were flying on the refurbished aircraft where you have your own TV the agent told me "" I don't know. I know it's an Airbus"". This airline is really strict about check in and carry on baggage. Carry on max is 5KG and min was 6KG and the agent is telling me that I need to pay extra $45 so I just told them that my laptop is in there as well and he let it go. The food was awful. I am however impressed by the flight attendants. They seem really nice and smiles all around. Bring your own food water and entertainment. Do not get an Aisle seat as you will not have a peaceful flight. Pay extra $200 and fly other airline."
3947,Round Trip Toronto to Paris. Paid upgrade for seats in front economy class. Plane very dirty both ways no inflight entertainment ie: movie. Have taken many international flights most economy a few business and have never been on one where you did not have at least 1 or 2 movies plus other entertainment. The cost of AIR Transit was not any less than the other flights. I at least expect the plane to be a little cleaner and not smell like the toilets. Meals were also very marginal. Will never take again nor recommend to my friends or family. Bad trip.
3948,This is a bad bus service. On my travel BKK-CCU the check-in lines were ridiculous with attendants weighing every piece of baggage. Not sure if the web check-in works as I still had to stand in a long line for over 75 minutes to hand in baggage. The flight itself was fine seats seemed like they were for kids. Attendants seem inexperienced and lack manners.
3949,BKK-HKT return and KUL-JOG DPS-KUL and liked their modern fleet punctuality and cabin comfort. What I dislike is their online-booking system that tries to sell various add-ons that may or may not be useful. This also results in the prices not being transparent and I ended up paying more than anticipated.
3950,It pains me not to give Alitalia a high mark. Their inflight experience in Business Class is impressive. But it's everything leading up to the flight that is a disaster. Their website is outdated and nearly impossible to use. Their call center is a joke with incompetent agents who read off a script. And Alitalia will change flight times on a whim and penalize the traveler financially. In our experience after paying over $8000 for a ticket they charged an additional $850 for change fee and $1500 for fare difference when I asked for an earlier flight after they changed flight times from the original booking and shortened my connection time in Rome. They also changed my booking from Business to Economy and I had to make innumerable calls to their idiotic call center to try and resolve it. Once in the air the service was lovely from a friendly sharp-looking crew. The food is a showcase of the best of Italy with delicious pastas and breads served course-by-course. I don't drink but the wine list was extensive. They provide a high-end Ferragamo amenity kit. And the seats are lie-flat and great for a long sleep. The only drawback from the inflight experience is a poor IFE system with limited options and a dirty Business Class bathroom. If Alitalia can get their act together on the ground they can become a well-rounded and competitive airline. But until then despite a great inflight product I will avoid them.
3951,AZ703 IST-FCO connecting onto AZ 630 FCO-MIA Business Class/29 June. On boarding in IST the forward attendant was busy in the galley on her cellphone with no greeting or attention to the boarding. Her service was minimal and after the light breakfast she brought a pass-riding co-worker to the jumpseat and closed the curtain where she remained for the rest of the 2 hour flight. FCO-MIA was the exact opposite. The purser (and the entire Magnifica Class crew) was/were attentive cordial available willing to help and grateful for passengers choosing AZ. On approaching MIA the purser came to my seat acknowledged my frequent flyer status (DL) and offered enrolment into the AZ program. I really like AZ when a crew is good; the problem is the inconsistency of AZ crews! They also tend it seems to focus more on co-workers than revenue passengers.
3952,Vancouver to Frankfurt. Even cabin staff were commenting on how narrow the aisles were. I am a large person but have never been so uncomfortable in an airline seat. The air-conditioning was on all the time and the blankets that they had were for sale and I just refuse to pay for things that should be included on a transatlantic flight. Staff were so busy trying to sell us stuff that they had no time to just attend to people's needs in the cabin. It was impossible to move because there was no way to stand up without being in someone's view of the overhead TV screens or bumping into the duty free cart. On a 12 hour flight it should be possible to stretch your legs once in a while. It's unhealthy to sit so long. No mention of the special meal I requested. I guess you get what you pay for. Although the flight came to almost $1100 at least $600 was taxes so I should have expected poor service!
3953,I booked a direct flight to Greece and back to Toronto. Last minute they informed us that we had to stop in Montreal. After we were at the airport and on the plane - not only was there a stop but we had to change planes as well. If I wanted to book a connection I would have done so. Flight attendants say 'well things happen' well it seems they have been 'happening' on every flight to Greece all summer long. If you pay extra you get a pillow blanket and earphones but get rude treatment for whatever minor request you may have. I can deal with unpleasant food and I'll try to even accept that they use old planes but do not treat me like I am stupid.
3954,Our flight KUL-SGN was forced to return due to a tropical Storm in SGN. That was unavoidable so we accepted that we had no choice. However on return to the LCCT the absence of senior staff and the overall treatment of all passengers was appalling. Passengers were left to fend for themselves and there was a disgraceful lack of communication My wife and I had to make our own way through Immigration to try to find a hotel room. Staff seemed confused and leaderless.
3955,BKK-KUL KUL-HKT BKK-HKT. Had booked for my girlfriend and myself to fly from BKK-HKT but had to change plans and flew BKK-KUL and KUL-HKT later on. Fast check-in at Suvarnabhumi at self-check-in terminals but extremely slow baggage drop-off! Flights were acceptable considering the reasonably low prices. No attention from flight attendants whatsoever. Seating space limited on both flights. Have been much more satisfied when flying on other low cost carriers.
3956,Staff indifferent and rude. We had a 4 hour delay from Kona to Portland and they offered no inflight freebies to compensate. Going to Maui they kept serving alcohol to passengers that were drunk.
3957,Alaska Air has a bad reputation because of frequent flight delays. We weren't surprised when our flight was delayed several hours in Kelowna BC on Feb 22nd. We then missed our connections in Seattle and in Portland to Maui Hawaii. After all the delays we were looking forward to finally boarding our flight to Maui and sitting in our first class seats for which we had paid a lot of extra money. What a disappointment! It was an old dirty plane with the most uncomfortable seats we have ever experienced. The seats were old and worn and lacked cushioning. To top it off the backs reclined only about 5 degrees. The inflight entertainment was of such poor quality we couldn't use it - the audio and screen were awful. We are vegetarians and Alaska Air only offers fish and chicken. The good thing about the flight were the flight attendants who were pleasant and cheerful. We arrived in Maui and because of all the delays we were up 24 hours before being able to finally get to bed. So all in all we were not happy customers. Alaska needs to improve their planes and give much more thought to passenger comfort and service. We have been to Hawaii 20+ times on other airlines and never had such an uncomfortable flight as on Alaska.
3958,I recently flew round-trip from Boston to Seattle on Alaska Airlines. I was happy that we: 1) arrived safely 2) arrived on-time. I didn't check a bag so cannot rate their handling of my luggage. I was surprised to learn that even on longer haul flights in-flight entertainment was not complimentary as it is on other airlines. In addition the food offerings had no hot meal suitable for a vegetarian at any meal. My seat on the flight to SEA was very uncomfortable but adequate on the return flight. Alaska Airlines got the major points right but there's plenty of room for improvement!
3959,It seems all AT flights leave London Gatwick at the same time from their own tiny row of desks in a back corridor which makes it chaotic to say the least especially as there is no online check in available from LGW. On the day we travelled every flight was overbooked so people were being strongly encouraged to accept vouchers and travel later in the week. We were not told at check in as we apparently should have been that due to a catering strike in Toronto the food quality on the flight would be greatly diminished. They weren't wrong - the worst food and the smallest amount I've ever seen. As for the complimentary glass (less than 100ml) of wine with dinner. We ordered an extra snack from the cabin crew which took over 2 hours to appear and the new seat-back video system has very few movies / shows loaded and they're definitely from the bargain shelves of the video rental stores. They've also installed the kit to run the screens underneath your seat so if you're in the habit of occasionally sitting with your feet positioned behind your knees you'll be very uncomfortable. Sometimes needs must but please find the extra and fly with a proper airline.
3960,"Amsterdam to Vancouver (10.5 hour flight) with Option Plus upgrade. Travelled with 6 members of family including an infant. Seats were so narrow that the flight was torturous for adults of average size. Attempted to upgrade to Club Class but were told there were only 4 seats available. Once on the plane there were at least 9 empty seats in Club Class. On board service was disorganized and poor. Asked for the baby bassinet 6 times and each time was told ""Sorry I forgot"". We sat in row 4 (directly behind Club Class) and there was absolutely no ventilation or air-conditioning in this section. All passengers in this section were sweating and overheating. When flight attendants were advised of the uncomfortable temperatures in this section nothing was done. Will never use this carrier again."
3961,KUL-MEL-KUL and KUL-LGW. The cabin is clean and modern the staff friendly attentive and do an excellent job. Food was ok - reasonably priced and sufficient. The toilets were reasonably clean even on long flight to London from KUL. All flights on time. Generally very happy with the service shame they've stopped flying to the UK! If flying long haul make sure you take some entertainment.
3962,LAX-SJD-LAX Feb 15 First Class. What a disappointing experience. We purchased (not upgraded or miles) first class tickets to Cabo expecting a lot more. The first class seat pitch was awful in rows 2 and 3. Very cramped! Forget it if the person in front of you leans back at all. It also appears that the 3rd (and last row of 1st) has minimal seat recline. The condition of the seats : The leather was very distressed marked up and very worn. When we boarded at Cabo for the return flight to LAX there were crumbs all over the seats and floor. The food (both ways): a chicken sandwich with a single tomato slice some orzo and a piece of chocolate. Not even packets of salt and pepper accompanied the trays. I'd say this product is an embarrassment to this airline.
3963,June 15 ORD-FCO was scheduled to take off at 8.40 pm. At around 8.30 it was announced flight was delayed then announced that it was mechanical issues. At around 11pm people were told to go pick up their luggage (which was never loaded onto plane) and those passengers who lived in Chicago were told to go home the rest of us were told to go to Alitalia check in where we would be given a hotel room for the night. The process of getting a room and getting to the hotel took 2 hours. People in wheelchairs and families with small kids were standing waiting for shuttle buses to their hotels. We were told to return to airport at 10am next day to check in for a flight to depart at 2pm. One look at the line told me that 2pm was fantasy it actually took off around 4pm. We stood in line for 4 hours to get seats sorted. The plane we flew on was old grubby no entertainment and terrible food. During the 4 hours waiting on Monday passengers were given no information from Alitalia no refreshments were offered no consideration given to those traveling with babies or elderly.
3964,LHR-FCO-TLV-FCO-LCY - This airline is worse than any European Budget Airline. 3 out of 4 of the flights were delayed and no one seemed to care. If you are above 175cm doing not fly with this airline otherwise your knees will be pressed against the seat in front of you. Make sure you have a meal before you get on the flight as the food is limited to a very small packet of dried snacks. All of the aircraft's are very old and do not have any screens showing you the flight information. Also do not transfer at FCO unless you have more than 3 hours between flights as the additional security checks are chaotic. Terrible experience.
3965,London City to Rome and back to London Heathrow. We got to and from Italy safely the crews were friendly but don't expect anything other than a tiny packet of breadsticks and a juice water coke or wine on the flights. Rome airport is the worst I have experienced as it is disorganised and crowded. All in all nothing special but they got us to our destination relatively comfortably.
3966,My outward flight was late leaving aircraft was the newest version of the A330 complete with screens in the rear of the seat in front. However the inflight catering was abysmal tiny portions of barely adequate food. The complimentary glass of wine was almost undrinkable. The inflight entertainment was hopeless and immediately forgettable. Return flight was in the older version of the A330 with screens in the middle of the plane every ten rows. No escape from inadequate films. Trying to sleep was impossible being woken every 20/30 minutes with some announcement or other. Again there was a prohibition on the consumption of duty free drinks - alcoholic or not. However there was seemingly no limit to the amount that could be bought from the trolley as evidenced by a group of youths occupying two rows of seats. That they became loud and intoxicated seemed just to add to their enjoyment whilst annoying many others. My conclusion is that the airline has taken many an idea from Ryanair. Cheap it may be but be warned!
3967,"LGK-SIN. No frills as expected aircraft was clean service efficient flight delayed 30 minutes but made up some time in its turnaround at LGK. A320 seats were rather cramped with minimal legroom for an average sized ""westerner"". Some English cabin announcements were very difficult to understand."
3968,Have been flying Air Asia for 5 years and now only when I have to. A discount airline but prices keep going up. Seats are narrow and all the advertising inside the cabin reminds me of a bus not an airline.
3969,I flew from DFW to Seattle then on to Honolulu. Interior of the planes are shabby and worn. Seats are hard and narrow with minimum recline. No pillows blankets or footrests. FA tossed a bag of mixed nuts toward my hubby by the window seat couldn't she have handed it to him?
3970,Flight was from Amsterdam to Rio de Janeiro with a transit in Rome. Before that I have a connection by KLM. There are several transfer counters in Rome airport but all pointing me to the other for the boarding pass. I thought any transfer counter can issue the boarding pass? When I purchased the ticket back in November 2013 I personally called the Italian call centre to request my special meal on board. I did this on all other legs of my trip on other airlines. However during the flight my special meal was not available and not booked. The cabin crew did not even try to solve the problem. On my other legs on other airlines I did get my requests. This shows that Alitalia is terrible with customer service and also inflight services.
3971,Just landed at FCO from LAX. Worst long haul flight I've ever had. Upgrade to premium economy. Promised great seats and better food by the agent. $3.200 round trip ticket a total waste of money for 5 of us. Told 120 degree reclining seat - just read the fine print 'up to 120 degree' reclining seat was closer to 90 degrees! Five of us had seats together then reassigned at check in. Terrible in flight movie selection. Trash all over the plane. So disappointed and now have to fly home in 2 weeks. Nothing good about the flight.
3972,Flew from Toronto-Rome-Tel Aviv on May 3 and returned on June 3. I was flabbergasted that Alitalia uses such old planes. There was no in-flight entertainment system on the transatlantic flight (both ways). From the comments on here and speaking with American friends who fly the airline often it doesn't seem to be case with U.S. routes (they use newer planes) so Canadian customers be aware that you will get shafted. I echo the sentiment on here: why bother and offer headphones for such clunky equipment? I will say that the flights left on time and arrived on time (minimal delays) and my luggage was waiting for me which is always a nice feeling. The food was just adequate. From Toronto-Rome they served for breakfast a puny Danish and Oreo cookies. My luggage was 3-5 lbs overweight and they said nothing so I appreciated that. Service was fine and flight attendants were pleasant enough but I think in this day and age not having an in-flight entertainment system for 8-9 hour flight is just unacceptable especially when pretty much every major European airline offers it. I will only fly Alitalia again if they have an amazing sale. Otherwise there are better options out there.
3973,Considering their boasting of upgrading the fleet flight I was on was quite disappointing. If you want a half- decent seat or a realistic amount of luggage for an overseas journey or even a headset you'll have to shell out a fair bit more money. If you have to cancel for some reason you won't get any of your ticket or upgrade back. The real notable problem though is the very meagre meal service. For an 8 hour flight the meals are more the size of a snack and certainly not enough. And even if you want to buy something extra unless you have a credit care you're out of luck. The same goes for anything including headphones. The only plus was the staff who were a bit of fresh air amongst this sea of low mediocrity.
3974,This airline is getting worse by the minute the flight from Manchester is always late. They can change your flight as and when but you try and make a change and there is a charge or nothing they can do. I am so sorry there is no other airline that does direct to Birmingham or Manchester as I would use them instead.
3975,I started flying another airline about 2 years ago but today decided to give Alaska another chance. I was sorely disappointed. The ticketing agents greeted me with frowns and a cold mechanical demeanour. The woman managing the line was condescending and seemed irritated with everyone. When I boarded I found my seat 3-A to not fully recline. The amount of leg room wasn't enough to cross my leg at the ankle and the general appearance was worn out and dirty. Once we were in the air the man in front of me reclined and I was no longer able to reach my bag under the seat. Now I would expect this in a coach seat but again they're calling this first class. I was served a lacklustre although well presented breakfast of eggs with tomato and asparagus a potato cake and fresh (ish) fruit. The flight attendant in my cabin was prompt and polite but the announcement about Alaska air credit cards droned on for what seemed like an eternity. Alaska built a reputation with exceptional customer service and a clean well maintained fleet of aircraft. Today booth there workforce and equipment seems to be in need of a serious overhaul.
3976,I fly Alaska a lot - MVP Gold for several consecutive years. I maintain this status mainly through partner airline miles. The main reason I stick with Alaska is that they have direct flights to two of my primary destinations from SEA where other airlines have stops in between. Service on Alaska is wildly variable. One flight will be the best service I can remember and the very next flight will be painful and unpleasant. So - if you are lucky and get a newer aircraft and a good crew you are good to go. If on the other hand you get one of the worn-out planes and/or a crew that couldn't care less if you were there or not.
3977,Flew from SFO to Seattle Seattle to LA and then Seattle to SFO. Check in and boarding was seamless - for each flight we departed either on time or ahead of the scheduled departure time and luggage was always ready to be picked up within 20 mins of exiting the aircraft. Flight crew are friendly. Will fly with them again.
3978,ORD-FCO-IST in Economy on May 22-23 2014. The plane from Chicago to Rome -- an airbus A320-200 - smelt the upholstery was stained seats were not equipped with individual screens. And then there were the Alitalia flight attendants - a dour group that couldn't be bothered to smile and were practically taken aback by requests for things like water. I will never again complain about my usual carrier Delta.
3979,"This was my first flight with an international carrier and I was unimpressed to say the least. I flew round trip from New York to Rome in economy class. The cabin was extremely cramped and the plane was old. On the way to Rome I was assigned a different seat from the one I originally chose when I booked months in advance. I am a small person but there was still very little leg room. My return trip from Rome was worse. Check-in took forever and the airport staff was rude. Upon checking in the agent at the counter told me he couldn't give me a seat assignment ""at this time"" and I would have to get my seat assignment at the gate that is unless I wanted to pay an additional 70 euro for a ""comfort seat"" on an exit row. Again I had already selected a seat months in advance. The food and cabin service were adequate and both flights were on-time. Other than that it was an unpleasant experience. I will choose a different carrier in the future."
3980,TS255 Manchester-Vancouver 19th May - old plane no individual video screens but there was more leg room than on other long haul flights we have made recently. We were 1.5 hours into our flight before we were offered a drink. Food was the worst inedible rubbish I have ever been offered on a flight no polite words can describe what it taste like just as well I wasn't hungry. Awful selection of inflight videos.
3981,Worst airline I've flown with in a long time cheap yes but for long haul (Gatwick to Vancouver) I'd prefer to pay the extra. Food inedible I didn't have a credit card so was not able to purchase any drinks or better food (cash is not accepted) entertainment was a tiny overhead monitor every 10 or so rows which I couldn't listen to because again you needed a credit card to purchase headphones. Toilet with baby change was broken on my side of the plane and the aisle to cross over was blocked by an elastic strip so I had to walk all the way to the back of the plane and back around to change my child. Also silly rules about weight allowance distribution and general lack of help for mums travelling alone with children. Not impressed.
3982,Manchester - Vancouver 8 June 2012 and Vancouver - Manchester 24 June 2012. Outward flight just about tolerable. Seats very narrow and very narrow gangways with 3+3+3 across an Airbus. Food what you'd expect on a cheap (ish) flight. Coming back was horrible. Arrived at Vancouver airport 2.5 hours before departure to find check-in queue already 100 metres long. Inadequate number of check-in desks trying to deal with 3 separate flights. Queue moved 10 metres in 40 minutes but then a bit quicker. Concern mounting everywhere that we would be denied boarding or that flight would be seriously delayed. No announcements no staff on hand to explain - general couldn't-care-less attitude. Asked to see check-in supervisor but she declined to appear. Finally we arrived at check-in after 90 minutes standing in the queue and saw that they had opened more desks. Further 30 minutes standing for security and we headed straight for departure lounge to find them already boarding. Miraculously flight left on time but a lot more could have been done to soothe angry passengers. Once aboard cabin crew on this flight completely cackhanded. Man next to us had chicken dinner tipped into his lap. I was hit by passing trolley at least six times because my arm was about 10 mm over the edge of the arm rest (I am 1.82 m tall and weigh 80 kg). Tonic water went down narrowly missing me but wetting floor all around. Night flight over the arctic but windows kept up all the way so no sleep possible. No long-haul flight in economy is really pleasant but this was the worst I have experienced. Schedules of this return flight were changed three times in months and weeks prior to departure. No explanation ever offered contrary to their conditions of carriage.
3983,BKK-Penang return. Asked and paid for assistance as have problems walking and needed a wheelchair. Had a chair on the outward trip as far as the bus then left to struggle on and off the bus on my own and to climb up to the aircraft. At Penang Airport had chair but had to walk up 2 flights of steps. The return was not too bad till got to Bangkok - no chair waiting the air hostess tried to ring for a chair but nobody answered the phone. Had to walk whole way through the airport with great difficulty and then collect my luggage. By the time I got to arrivals to meet my daughter I could hardly walk and was in a great deal of pain. Will never travel Air Asia again alone.
3984,SEA-ANC return in First. On the way up Anchorage was expecting bad weather. The FAs who had already delayed providing any first class service until about 50 minutes into the flight decided more than an hour out of ANC to prepare the cabin for landing. They got on the overhead and informed everyone that the captain had ordered this then promptly ceased service closed the restrooms and plopped down in their jump seats to chat. (This was clearly visible from First.) About a half hour of smooth flying later the pilot got on the intercom and announced that the FAs should begin preparing the cabin for arrival. It was obvious he had no idea the FAs had ceased working 30 minutes earlier. Alaska really needs to do something about its FAs. They used to be the best in the business such that it was a real treat to get to fly Alaska on this leg; now this route in particular is staffed by burnouts. I get better treatment on Delta for my Alaska frequent flyer status than I do on Alaska.
3985,Traveled to and from Anchorage from Kansas City in Sep 2012. Amazing to find the Alaska Airlines structures built in several airports to squeeze hold baggage fees from customers - but poorly staffed. Lines were longer when standing in line to check bags where baggage fees had been earlier paid on the web by credit card. On the full flight back from Anchorage to Seattle on 17 September I don't know that I have ever been packed tighter in an aircraft. I am not a tall man and my knees were in contact with the seat in front of me for that uncomfortable 3 hour leg. I know the economy is tough and the airline business intent upon wringing the last buck they can from the consumer but Alaska Airlines has taken this to a new level. I felt for the flight attendants hawking meals video devices and other such up and down the aisle. In Seattle prior to the last leg to Kansas City they gave us a start by posting a 7 hour delay- with no explanation whatever. Fortunately after 20 minutes of angst the original departure time was reinstated. I last traveled to Alaska on Alaska Airlines quite a few years ago and the present experience in coach was like night and day.
3986,Budget price and you get what you pay for. Toronto-Rome return 20+ year old A330 15 inch ceiling mounted TVs that do not work - neither does the audio system. I don't understand why they bother to provide headphones! Decent leg room but seats that recline in your face so it is hard to use a laptop on the seatback table - needless to say there are no power outlets WiFi etc. Food & beverages were okay and promptly served - thereafter the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen for the duration of the 10 hour flight. Water etc was self service from the galley. Despite a 45 minute delay on departure the flight arrived on time. Before flying Alitalia long haul find out what plane they are using on that route. They advertise their new fleet but be warned they are still flying ancient and well worn aircraft on transatlantic routes and the cabin service is risible.
3987,Perth to KUL. My elderly mother paid extra to travel premium economy - what a waste! On both flights ground staff did not give priority boarding to premium economy passengers - everyone just barged on to the aircraft without a care for anyone else. Space between aisles was much tighter than other airlines and the seats certainly seem to be less roomier. Like a previous reviewer if you are going to have rules about luggage you must be prepared to enforce them! We had originally booked flights leaving Perth mid-afternoon and today I was informed by email that the flight had now been cancelled and we have been moved to an 8 pm flight. No sign of any compensation nothing but a note in the email to say that we hope it won't inconvenience you in any way!
3988,Alaska Airlines is slightly better than other major U.S. carriers. Like the legacy carriers they have also done away with blankets entertainment and free coach food. Fortunately flight attendants were actually kind and I did find the seats to be noticeably more comfortable. Having a friendly smiling crew and a nice seat made quite a difference.
3989,"Heading to Disneyland for our daughter's sixth birthday. Planned well in advance and when it comes to checking in they have separated the three of us with their updated seat assignment. We all have the same last name an it clearly states that we're travelling with a child. Get to the gate only to be told by the agent that she can't do anything and we should ask the flight attendants to find us seats together. We get in the plane and explain the situation to the flight attendants and they now tell us that hey can't do anything and we're out of luck. ""Maybe someone will be nice enough to switch seats with you"". Is this really how you handle mistakes? By passing the buck and doing nothing? A complete disappointment from a company that has obviously forgotten what customer service means."
3990,"It is now very obvious why Allegiant's pricing is so economical. I guess as with everything else in life you get what you pay for. Apparently they do not know how to schedule their pilots efficiently and therefore have to cancel flights when they don't have a pilot for the flight that you paid for. To make matters worse, they cannot tell you when your flight will be. So now we are stranded in Raleigh, North Carolina waiting for either a phone call or text message to let us know when our flight will be. They refused to offer any assistance for hotels for the night and say they do not do that despite the fact that this is an Allegiant problem, not mine. They have been less than helpful and offered little to no assistance or information as to when and how I will be getting home from my vacation. So we will continue to sit and wait on Allegiant to figure out what they're going to do to get us home and until then we're stranded in Raleigh."
3991,SIN-CNX-SIN. Good value for money. New A320-200 both ways. All flights on time. Aircraft clean spacious. Load only 50%. No IFE. FA inexperienced fairly professional but without personality. Food purchased in advance was very disappointing (both ways) and just in foil with a spoon absolutely nothing else not even salt. Food expensive for nothing. Biggest minus is the hassle with transfers where one has to vacate and re- enter the airport to sort baggage custom and immigrations for onwards travels. The airline tolerates mostly 2 pieces of hand-luggage. Inscribed luggage charged overweight if more than 1-2 kg. When purchase ticket one has to be careful not to be trapped purchasing expensive seating and superfluous insurance.
3992,Flights from Perth-KL then KL to Bangkok return. 4 flights 1 was fantastic. The rest were very disappointing. Even a 3 star airline should be able to provide clean seating and toilets. We were subject to 'attitude' from staff when we complained about the chewing gum over our table dried vomit over the back of the seats in front of us and the accompanying smell. We were eventually moved. A toilet door broke because it wouldn't shut people sitting adjacent had to put up with the chemical smell. Our pre-ordered meals weren't served to us.
3993,Fully satisfied in the past however my last two trips were awful. Since Air Asia introduced web check-in the problem has started. My flight was to Chennai I did web check-in and arrived 2.5 hours early for baggage drop off. However the baggage drop off area was total chaos! People were cutting in between the lines without any respect for the queue. I waited in line for almost 2 hours without moving. 40 mins before departure two new counters opened for Chennai only and I managed to get my luggage dropped off 20 mins before departure. Ran for immigration but my expatriate gold card helped me pass through quickly and I boarded the flight 5 mins before departure. This has now happened to me a few times in the past when there was separate check-in counters there were no issue.
3994,One way from San Diego to Seattle in first class. I paid approximately $450 for the seat. The extent of the food service on the 2.5 hour flight was a fruit and cheese plate. Pitiful to describe and worse to eat. There was also absolutely no in-flight entertainment no headsets and no video.
3995,We were very disappointed during our 4 weeks trip around Alaska and way to Hawaii with Alaska Airlines. We used it for many flights. SEA-JUN JUN-CVA CVA-ANC Fairbanks-Barrow Anchorage-HNL and HNL-SEA and always the same opinion. Old dated planes service near zero (no free meals) just peanuts and drinks. You have to pay for your luggage when you don't travel only around Alaska: for us a total of 80 USD. More over no entertainment you have to pay 10$ to watch old movies. To conclude crew not very friendly.
3996,I already checked into my flight and got my boarding pass at the airport. However with Alaska you have to wait in line to pay for your luggage separately (is this something new?). By the time it was my turn to pay for my luggage they said my luggage was too late for the flight. The luggage needs to be paid and checked in 40 min before the flight. As a result they took my boarding pass away and switch me to a flight 8 hrs later. Because of the huge delay my business activities all have to be sacrificed.
3997,Flight and rental car were both booked through Allegiant. The flight from Cincinnati was delayed due to someone inadvertently deploying an emergency shoot. It took over 6 hours to get the plane fixed with no options for alternative flights. The pilot gave out erroneous information about the situation during the delay. We were assured once we got to our destination that the rental car agency would be monitoring the flight and someone would be available to assist. Upon arrival no one was at the counter and the security guard said no one was ever available off hours no matter what the airline or rental car agency (Alamo) said. No Allegiant representatives were available or could be reached by phone. I tried Allegiant in an attempt to save a little money but by the time they add a fee for practically everything you end up paying the same price as other major airline for worse service and horribly uncomfortable seats.
3998,"While waiting on the plane to land and to head off to Phoenix. It was an hour past the time it was supposed to land, so my wife asked the lady at the desk for an update as nothing was announced over the loud speaker. The lady was rude and unprofessional and answered in a rather rude manner. Then finally about 1.5hrs they announce something is wrong with the plane and it may be 2 hrs or so. So everyone waited patiently for about 2 hrs, then all of a sudden here comes that loud voice again and it said we don't have the part to fix it. There's no need to worry, But of course We are the ones that have been waiting for 3-4 hrs. Then they say a plane will be flying in from Florida to fix the plane in Ohio and it will be 2hrs till the plane arrives before they even attempt to fix the plane I will be riding.  Keep in mind it's around the 5 hr mark now. Then they say if you want to give us your luggage we can return it to you, or if you stay we will have pizza! Really pizza? I did not sign up for a slumber party with strangers. Then to make things better the airport (not Allegiant) handed out cots so we're all camped out in the terminal. They didn't even offer any food vouchers or anything to make up for lost time."
3999,"You book your flight and when you pick your seat you pay extra. They charge for a carry on and if you haven't prepaid for them it's $50 when you board. A check in line that wrapped around the building, the staff member greeting passengers on boarding looked straight over everyone and never said one word. The cabin was dirty and the seat next to me was ripped. The seats do not recline t back and are upright and very uncomfortable. We ordered a coke, water, M&M's, two cookies and crackers for a total of $12."
4000,Toronto to Glasgow on June 8. Bought the ticket (family member passed away) the night before and was surprised how many seats were still available. Staff were friendly cheerful. Seats were large enough even for my ample bottom. The food was as expected just palatable but there were 4 choices and the meals were hot. I'd suggest bringing ear plugs as they are not available on board and should you have a family of screaming kids for the entire flight (as we did) you will need them. The staff although friendly gave no suggestions or assistance to the screaming children. I must admit that thankfully not all children were unhappy mine was kept entertained with electronics I brought with us and there were many others that were wonderful travelers. The flight left and arrived on time plane was clean staff was friendly. Only downside was limited number of toilets. Would travel with them again.
4001,The night before I flew from CNX I spent a good half an hour checking-in via the web for my flight. On arrival at CNX they had 3 flights departing at approximately the same time and only 3 check-in desks open. There was no Baggage Drop-Off counter for passengers who took the time to check-in online - even their self-check- in facility was out of order! I queued for 40 minutes. Not providing the facility at CNX whilst promoting its use is unreasonable and irrational. Besides this aspect of their service this flight and the previous five with Air Asia have been similarly delayed. Don't be taken in with the price sometimes it is cheaper to fly TG. All the planes I have flown are exceptionally clean and look and feel new however I regret that Air Asia is loosing its credibility and its novelty is wearing mighty thin.
4002,SIN-KUL-VTE return all flights on A320. The flights were okay but not clean though. There was gum in my seat pocket. Crew members were pleasant on all flights except one on the VTE-KUL route.
4003,I showed up 2 hours early but a TSA-Alaska problem made me miss my flight. Their small print symbol calling for additional security screening was missed by TSA so when I went to board they had to send me back to TSA and I missed my flight. The worst part is that they wouldn't put me on the next flight to my destination (on another airline) and made me wait 5+ hours for another Alaska flight. I would have been better off driving. I'll avoid flying with Alaska air in the future if I can.
4004,My husband and I were refused to fly because he had an airline approved oxygenator to take on as hand luggage and it would not be used in flight. We had purchased First class tickets to from Seattle to Hawaii they put us on another Airline those seats were economy and the cost of those tickets were $360.00 pp and we had paid over $700 pp - they gave us a refund of $105 pp.
4005,LAX-PDX-BLI and BLI-SEA-SFO. All flights were completely full. Comfort on all aircraft's was surprisingly good. What lets them down is the staff. Robotic flight attendants going through the motions. Check-in staff in Bellingham were agonizingly slow. There were only two customers in front of me. 20 mins later there were still two customers in front of me. When I finally reached the counter my bag was 50.7 pounds. I am told to re-pack it. I took one shoe out of my suitcase and put it in my carry-on and she accepted my suitcase. On both Horizon Air flights (PDX-BLI-SEA) flight attendants sat in their jumpseats and read magazines the entire flight. My Alaska Seattle-San Francisco flight ended up arriving over an hour late. I had to run through SFO to catch my Air New Zealand flight. What a pleasure to be greeted at the door of Air NZ by smiling polite cabin crew.
4006,Found planes to be aged and shabby. Tray tables dirty would not want to eat off them. Staff seemed friendly but their uniforms were unimpressive. Had a delay out of Seattle and everyone was made to get off plane travel by train to another terminal to board another plane because of a broken seat. This was obviously known about before we boarded so they should not have put that plane back into service before it was fixed. Would not recommend this airline.
4007,"I booked my daughter on return flight 638 from Sanford to Concord for Saturday evening. We were on our way out of the door to the Airport when we received a text saying the flight was canceled. No explanation, no information about rescheduling. I called the customer service line and waited for 1 hour and 47 minutes before someone picked up the phone. They told me the flight would not be rescheduled and we would have to catch the Wednesday flight 4 days later! Not an option for us, put my daughter and granddaughter in car and made an 1100 mile road trip. I wish I would have read other reviews before making this huge mistake."
4008,"My family flew to Fort Lauderdale and back to Concord on separate flights. My first flight left on time but my sister's flight was scheduled to leave at 9am did not leave until 3.45 pm. On return flight my plane was scheduled to take off at 6 pm, we finally got on the plane after 7 pm and didn't take off until 8.30pm. My sister's return flight was scheduled to take off at 1 pm and didn't take off until 3.30. The customer service is the worst I have experienced. I needed to change a reservation (hotel room) and waited over an hour and a half for a someone to pick up the phone. Altogether I was on the phone for 2 hours and 24 minutes to change one hotel room."
4009,April 2014 Naples to Rome (NAP-FCO). Rome to New York (FCO-JFK). Baggage check in seemed as if it would be easy at Naples which is a smaller airport. I was checking in 2 bags for work equipment. The baggage agent generated my boarding pass and baggage ticket stickered my luggage took it and told me I had to go to another counter to pay for the extra baggage. Then I had to go back to the original baggage check-in counter for my already printed boarding passes and baggage claim ticket stubs. Security was routine and a short line at 10am on a weekday. There were no power outlets at all in the gate area or just above it near the more comfortable couches. The first flight was routine. Economy row 8C. I think it was a 737. Upon arriving in Rome we deplaned and took the bus to terminal. I had to change terminals which according to the sign would be a 12 minute walk to Terminal G. What the sign did not say was after 2 minutes would be a passport control line which was 5 minutes. After that was the walk and a train shuttle ride to Terminal G for flight to NYC. The boarding was the cattle call I had read about. The plane was a 777-200ER. Ticket = Class Y/Economy. Seat row 27D center section of 4 seats. My concerns were warranted: No USB power jacks at the seats. Once on the plane and stowing my personal items the plane grew uncomfortably hot as we were on it for over an hour without proper air conditioning. We left 30 minutes late. An hour after takeoff the drink cart came through. 80 minutes into flight I received my vegetarian special diet meal for lunch which was vegetable Jalfrezi a cold lentil salad a tiny fruit salad and a breadroll. All adequate. After meal service at 2 hours after takeoff the fasten seat belt sign was finally turned off even though no bad weather. After meal service and coffee offering the FA's mostly disappeared to the back of the plane behind the curtain. FA's were professional and pleasant. I did not use the IFE at all. Self-service Water soda and breadstick snacks were available in galley area. Yes as others mentioned the IFE restricts legroom in many seats.
4010,Booked family of 4 trip to Birmingham UK - requested a vegetarian meal for myself but couldn't do that until we had reserved seating @ $25/pp both ways - another $200 over and above what seemed like reasonable fares - only to find on board a vegetarian meal is standard offer as part of the meal! The plane to UK was extremely old and the seating very cramped - we were exhausted by the time we reached our destination. On our return flight the plane was a newer model and the seating we had selected was nothing in comparison to the layout online - although alot more comfortable than before. The inflight entertainment was not well placed as the screen was either too close for proper viewing or too far which my younger child was unable to view due to the seat in front of him.
4011,Gatwick to Calgary. Dirty old planes cramped lights flashing in the cabin due to fault poor screens paid for extra legroom - was cramped against a wall. Food was awful. Will never use them again. One thing to note is that the Canadians do you make you feel very welcome when you arrive. Back in the UK - not one 'welcome' in the airport by staff. All very miserable and you need a pound coin for the luggage trolley.
4012,Onboard my seat was musty and dirty. I had already ordered food online and when I received the 'Chef and Crew's choice' dish it was cold and soggy. Thank goodness the price is reasonable or else I would lodge a complaint.
4013,KBV-BKK on A320. Flight on time bags a bit delayed its always the case in Bangkok. All in all quite a pleasant flight.
4014,KUL-PEN roundtrip on 25-26 December. A pleasant trip especially on the return leg. Aircraft was clean and stewardess friendly. The return trip was better as staff were more friendly and hospitable. Did not buy any drinks or food because it was a short flight. Overall a good trip and will fly them again if the price is good.
4015,Previously I have had mostly positive experiences with Alaska Airlines. However over an hour after boarding the plane we are still sitting at the gate waiting for maintenance and my 16 month old is getting fussy. I ask the FA if she can get us some juice to calm him down and am told no even though she is serving coffee to other passengers. 30 minutes later we are still sitting there and he is seeing everyone else getting drinks but him and starts to cry at which point the FA comes back and tells me to make him be quiet. I fly with my son almost twice a month and have never had a problem. On any other airline they would have tried to help the situation by talking to him or bringing a snack or a pair of wings. But not this one.
4016,Being based in Portland I am stuck traveling Alaska 75% of the time for business travel and was never impressed with the quality of the planes or service. Recently I used rewards miles for a trip to Honolulu. The plane was a standard 737 with absolutely no amenities. The overhead air barely blew. Service was terrible. Based on the most recent experience with their customer service I will try even harder to not fly Alaska and I am cancelling their rewards credit card. The other 25% I travel United and have never had a problem with their planes or service.
4017,I flew in from round trips OAK to HNL both flights were awful. The money I paid for these two flight's were great and that's the main reason I'm not too hateful towards them. The food was not bad. The staff service was good. The main reason my experience with Alaska Airlines was awful is because the actual aircraft's I flew in were horrible! The seats were incredibly small I was feeling very cramped during the whole flight's it was impossible to sleep on those plane's because the recliner's barely reclined. The leg room was ridiculous it's really hard to get up and go to the lavatory. The lavatory is also a bit small. There was not any complimentary in-flight entertainment expect the crew members offered screens to watch movies shows etc with a 10$ fee. Overall Alaska Airlines is mediocre. If you want a good price to go to Hawaii but understand that you will suffer cramped seats for 5 and half hours fly Alaska Airlines.
4018,"My family and I have flown with Allegiant Air at least two or three times a year from Cincinnati to Orlando/Sandford (back and forth) for several years now. Until Friday July 24 2015, our complaints have been minimal and at most had delayed departures because the planes weren't there yet! However, as of Friday July 24 2015, my family and I will no longer be flying Allegiant. We had an early flight out (6.45am), had checked in the night before, and arrived at 6.00am to depart as the airport is so small, it never takes more than 10 minutes to check in and get to gate. We couldn't find any signage indicating where to check bags through for Cincinnati and simply got in a line curbside because I had five days earlier experienced the same thing when dropping my son off to fly same route and had been directed there for checking his bag. We got in a fairly slow, long line and just as we reached the check-in attendant, after having been interrupted several times, she made the announcement baggage check in to Cincinnati, and several other cities was inside! We go back inside the Allegiant terminal, get in another line only to find out as we approached counter, we're told baggage check for Cincinnati was in Terminal A and pointed to a different area (one we never knew existed)! The attendant then tells us the flight just closed and we'd have to find another flight home and the fees would be $75 each person to do so. We explained we'd been there in lines trying to figure out where we were to check in and saw no indication Cincinnati was in Terminal A. To top it all off, the flight we were supposed to be on that closed at 6.10 had a thirty minute delayed departure. Had we known prior to arriving, we were to go to a different check in terminal, I would not be wasting my time sharing my negative review. We will be back to using sky miles again which is most likely less expensive in the long run as discount airlines like this one seem to nickel and dime customers anyway!"
4019,"Flight from Las Vegas to Boise was scheduled at 4.30, got pushed back 1hr, 1.5hr, 2.5hrs then arrived at the airport where it was delayed an additional 2 hrs due to ""Maintenance issues on the flight coming from Fresno"" - flight ended up being canceled. Vouchers were given out with a 0$ balance. Next day there were 2 workers checking people in with no sky cap and at least 150 people in line. Flown with them once previously and it was a disaster as well."
4020,"My family flew to Fort Lauderdale and back to Concord on separate flights. My first flight left on time but my sister's flight was scheduled to leave at 9am did not leave until 3.45 pm. On return flight my plan was scheduled to take off at 6 pm, we finally got on the plan after 7 pm and didn't take off until 8.30pm. My sister's return flight was scheduled to take off at 1 pm and didn't take off until 3.30. The customer service is the worst I have experienced."
4021,Flew non-stop Boston to FCO on March 19 and returned on the 28th. Have to say overall they have improved since my last flight in 2011 and dramatically so in the last 10 years. My pet peeve however is the lack of safety enforcement on the plane on takeoff and landing. Unlike other airlines not a single flight attendant came around to make sure seats were in the proper position (many were fully reclined) and several people were up and walking around indeed going into the overhead bins during or shortly after takeoff and landing on both flights! Very dangerous. Also although I had requested a gluten free meal I was served my gf meal with a wheat roll sitting in the coffee cup. Good thing I am every vigilant and did not assume that this was the best gluten free roll ever made! Also wish they would allow one to choose seat assignments at the time of booking like every other airline on the planet.
4022,HKT-CNX. Comfortable flight only marred by a group of unruly passengers. Thai crew unable to control them but then who could? Flight on time and thankfully shorter than advertised. New and clean plane with leather seating. All in all a decent experience will fly them again.
4023,MFM-BKK-HKT. Check-in was easy as I had prepaid for my luggage however I was unable to transfer my baggage at BKK and had to re-check my baggage. Flight was 30 mins delayed with very little updates. Once boarded the service was very professional and efficient. I had pre-ordered meals on both legs meals are quite cheap on the website however if you are hungry I would recommend having two meals.
4024,Flew SFO to SEA. My 9.20am flight was over sold. I was bumped to another flight leaving from OAK 5 hours later. My return flight left 5 hours late after changing planes twice because of mechanical problems. Worst flight experience I have had on many years and I fly 50000 plus miles a year. I haven't flown Alaska in 20 years and I never will again.
4025,I would not recommend Frontier for those with connections. My flight from BNA-SFO with a connection in Denver was grounded because of plane problems. We were grounded in St Louis and agents were most unhelpful. I was stuck in St Louis and only got to my destination because I booked other flights in order to do so. Frontier does not do anything but give a 200 voucher for a missed connection. On my way back from SFO to BNA (connecting through Denver) we were grounded for a medical emergency which is understandable however no help given to those who missed connections. I got home on my own doing by booking a Southwest flight while we were grounded in Grand Junction. They have limiting options to help you out if you miss a connection.
4026,I was flying from DCA to SAN with a connection in Denver. DCA to DEN was a nice enough flight with no complaints. However when my flight from DEN to SAN came they were unable to get a pilot. Keep in mind that DEN is Frontier's hub. This occurred at 10.10 pm and by the time I was able to speak with customer service the earliest flight that I could get to SAN was 9 pm the next day. Fortunately I did not have plans the next day but I know several people in the line who had to miss out on their plans due to this.
4027,"We live only minutes from Sanford airport but have never had the opportunity to fly out of there. My son and I were looking for flights to North Carolina and searched Allegiant. We made our reservations to fly up on Friday, July 24th returning the evening of July 25th. I was pleased with our flight up to North Carolina. Nothing major to complain about. We did not have checked baggage as our trip was only one night. Around 2.30 Saturday afternoon I received a text stating that our flight had been cancelled and a website link. The link was for their main website and offered no options as to what to do. I immediately got on the phone to call them and had to wait an hour and 10 minutes on hold before someone could pick up. The lady I spoke to simply told me my flight had been cancelled. I responded by saying that's not a problem just put us on the next flight out this evening. I was told that the next flight out would be Monday afternoon (this is Saturday). I was told I could receive a refund for the flight and given no other options. I asked if the company was going to pay for my rental car, hotel and food expenses for the next 2 days. Of course I received no reply."
4028,"They promise cheap fares but you end up paying just as much as any other airline. Their ""fees"" are asinine. Once you pay the ""fare"" for their flight, you have to pay extra for each bag, including carry on luggage. If you don't pay online ahead of time for your bags you pay significantly higher prices to pay at the airport. You also must pay extra to choose a seat and extra for ""priority boarding"" and you are charged $5 if you do not print your boarding pass at home. I am sitting at home waiting for my flight, which has been delayed from 8.50pm departure to 10.15 to 10.45. I attempted to call them to find out if I should reasonably expect to leave today at all. I was on hold for 29 minutes, then hung up on. My second call resulted in a 57 minute hold after which I was told ""oh sorry"" for the hold and assured numerous times that there would be absolutely no further delays. I received two additional texts after that delaying my flight until midnight and then 1am. I am certain it is only a matter of time before it is cancelled completely. I am livid and have no recourse at this point because I don't want to waste many more hours trying to call them back or sitting in the airport waiting for the inevitable cancellation. Spend the extra money to fly elsewhere."
4029,Staff rude. Delayed plane 3 times before they cancelled. When asking there why all the delays was told it was not my concern and that they would let us know when there would be another flight. Had to sleep at airport with a handicap child. Did not offer a place to stay. Will never fly or recommend.
4030,"Allegiant Air has the rudest staff and is always delayed. We were delayed both ways by hours, boarded and de-boarded twice, and then treated badly by customer service representatives when we tried to enquire about expected departure. This situation is normal for this airline and happened the last three times we flown with them. Never again!"
4031,Business class from JFK to Tel Aviv changing planes in Rome. I chose Alitalia because of the 1-2-1 across seating in business. Their arrival/departure times at all 3 airports were convenient. I used the business class lounges in all 3 airports: they were all relatively pleasant and much better than waiting at the gates. Complaints: Only on the first leg of the flight was there an English-language newspaper. While I have read some bad reviews of the lounge in Roma I found it pleasant if not outstanding. They did have decaf coffee which is a big plus for me. The food selection was limited and unexciting but I did expect better on board the flights themselves. Unfortunately on the JFK-Rome legs the food was truly awful and did not taste good. Perhaps the speciality meals would have been a better choice but I did not know in advance how bad the business class meals would be. I wish I had wrapped up some of the finger sandwiches from the Rome lounge and taken them with me back to NYC.
4032,LIN-LHR (Milan-Linate - London-Heathrow). Short flight from Italy to the UK. Pleasant enough nothing specifically remarkable but no real gripes either. I'd have no reservations about using the airline again.
4033,"Travelled with my husband from Sofia Bulgaria to Rome Italy and back with business class tickets. Inbound flight operated by Bulgaria Air and the outbound by Alitalia. The service I received was not up to the standards applicable for business class. We went through the same security and border control lines as economy passengers waited in the same area as economy passengers boarded the same bus and we boarded at the exact same time as economy passengers. Received no better service from the flight attendants. The only difference I saw was that the food in the business class cabin was better. On the first flight we did not check bags and printed the boarding passes at home. On our way back we had to check in one bag. There was a desk with sign ""sky priority"" with just one person serving customers. After the second flight my bag was not the first one to arrive although it was the only one with priority tag. In both cases we had to be transported from the airport to the plane by a bus. That was a terrible experience for business class passengers. On our way back we boarded the bus with priority but this means that we were one of the last ones to board the plane there was already no space for our handbags. Not entitled to lounge access either in Rome nor in Sofia. First flight was on time but was 30 minutes early on arrival in Rome. The second flight was 30 minutes late departing. Inbound flight was on a Embraer E-190 aircraft where we had 2 seats on each side of the aisle. The seats in business class are not wider do not have more leg room do not recline better than those in economy - they are the exact same seats. Outbound flight was on a Embraer E-175 aircraft which is essentially the same as the above with some ""extra"" - none of the first class seats has a window!"
4034,"I bought tickets to fly myself and my 2 young kids (ages 4 and 2) from Salt Lake to Kansas City 2 months in advance. Inexplicably Frontier did not assign us seats together. For each of the 4 legs on this round-trip gate agents did a little shuffling to get us in the same row. But I still had to personally ask other people already on their seats to move. Travelling alone this wouldn't have been a big deal but with two little kids? Just getting on the plane and taking care of everyone's food potty and entertainment needs is stressful enough. Frontier made this such an unpleasant experience that I will avoid getting any tickets on Frontier again. When I said something about this to a flight attendant I got the response ""Well that's Frontier for you!"""
4035,LAX-SEA-LAX-GDL in First Class. Alaska served the same meal consisting of a Chicken Sandwich and orzo pasta salad on all sectors. I was especially disappointed on the International sector of LAX-GDL. Alaska Airlines was on time for all sectors baggage was delivered promptly and the inflight cabin staff were efficient. They have to learn to vary their menu for First Class Passengers especially on International Sectors. Thus the mediocre rating.
4036,"I was a nervous wreck for 2 weeks leading up to this trip due to the horrible reviews. This flight was delayed approx 30 min. Boarding was fast and efficient. Crew was friendly, not overly nice, not rude. Flight was uneventful. Would I fly again? I will let you know after the return flight Aug 1st. I had no horrible complaints but no rave reviews either. You get what you pay for."
4037,"Flew out of Fresno on a business trip with work, there was 14 of us in total. I arrived at airport two hours before departure, little did I know that we wouldn't leave for another 7 hours from expected departure. I was supposed to arrive in Vegas at 8pm Wednesday night, arrived in Vegas at 2.30 am Thursday morning. When departing Las Vegas on Friday airline was on time! But it was too good to be true, due to mechanical failures we sat on the tarmac for almost three hours."
4038,"My first and probably last trip with this airline. The ground personal in both airports were inefficient and rude. At time of booking I advised of a wheelchair requirement. It was not offered at either airport and non were available. I attempted to check in online without success, so when I got to the airport I was charged $10.00 for a boarding pass. When I advised of my inability to check in online, I was told that was my problem. The return trip was delayed for 1 hour while we sat on the plane. The cabin personnel were very hospitable and helped offset some of the other negatives but not enough to get me to fly Allegiant again."
4039,IST-FCO-MIA AZ630 28 Jan travel between Rome and Miami in Premium Economy. I have flown AZ long haul several times in both Business and Prem Eco and quite like the hard product. I particularly like the Business seat it offers good privacy and nice comfort. On this trip in Prem Eco I found the seat somewhat uncomfortable. Well- padded the recline however is awkward and does not have a good recline. What bugs me about AZ is the crew is always reactive to the passenger; never anticipating passenger needs. When asked however service is provided quickly and graciously. On this trip however call lights went unanswered and crew was hard to find. AZ also seems to have an unwritten practice that employees family members and friends traveling with a crew member can sit wherever they find a vacant seat - in any cabin they want. This becomes a distraction to the working crew as they focus more on their traveling companions and less on higher-fare paying passengers.
4040,BKK to Hat Yai (HDY) and noticed service deterioration. Flight retimed one month in advance and cause me minor itinerary problem (despite their offer to change to earlier or later flight). Only one Bag drop counter for internet/ Kiosk check in opened. Their advertisement that internet check in is quicker and hassle - free is totally untrue. Once on board A320 aircraft is new and clean but seat pitch is a very tight. Aptitude of the crew does not seemed to be as good as their earlier year. My friend who sit upfront tried to purchase chicken rice and was told that only curry is available but I was told later that I can only get chicken rice because my curry is finished.
4041,Took the inaugural flight from Chiang Mai to Singapore. To say it was just another flight would be an understatement. And it was 30 minutes late which is about par for the course with Thai AirAsia. No apology for being late. Their slogan is 'newest planes newest routes'. Well it wasn't their newest plane which was delivered in time for the start-up of the SIN service. Judging by the crowds assembled in SIN for the return journey it looks like they are marketing the flight at the SIN end. There was no hype at CNX and I haven't seen any media coverage of the fact that the flight has now started. Most of the passengers were non-Thai. Standard Air Asia service. I cant believe they charge 30 baht for a small bottle of bottle. If you get a promotional fare its good value otherwise shop around. Having done PR for major events including such new services I was sorely disappointed. Frankly Thai Ai Asia's product is far below that of its big brother in Malaysia and it shows.
4042,"HKT-BKK. Online check-in down for several days. Attempting to check-in with a mobile proved both costly and fruitless until the day I was actually due to depart. I visited the Air Asia office on Thaweewong Road Patong a few days prior to departure and was informed that there had been a bomb scare at their offices which had negatively impacted their booking system but I didn't find anything on local news media to substantiate that claim. When I eventually did get the 2D barcode image on my mobile Air Asia's scanners at Phuket International appeared unable to read it. Fortunately there wasn't a queue at the Web Check-in desk and they were able to print the boarding pass for me instead. The flight departed 50 mins late but I had allowed ample time to my connecting flight to Dubai. But I would advise anyone proposing to fly with Air Asia where there is a connecting international flight to consider to allow ample time because flight delays and even cancellations are the order of the day on Thai Air Asia. On arrival at BKK a further delay of about 45 mins occurred because as I was informed by an airport employee Air Asia didn't have any staff to offload the luggage from the plane. Price wise when you add in all the add-ons together with the ""Convenience Fee"" the latter of which is the credit card charge there's not a lot of difference in price between Air Asia and there nearest rival Bangkok Air."
4043,"Evening flights had lengthy, unexplained delays both directions. This was a great inconvenience, which employees were unconcerned about. I witnessed one woman charged an additional $100 for large carry-on bag. Minutes later the same employee helped another woman ""squeeze"" her carry-on bag into the holder and not charge additional fees. Both should have been charged the fee as explained in the reservation process. Seats don't recline at all, uncomfortable. Lower prices equate to lower service."
4044,"I booked to avoid 10 hour drive to Myrtle Beach. Counting the drive to airport, it took 12 hours on Allegiant. Terrible airline and Huntington Airport. Gave them a 1 rating because zero is not an option."
4045,Flight 318 FCO (Rome) to CDG (Paris) January 26 2014. Flight departed and arrived on time seat somewhat uncomfortable not much in the way of a complimentary snack or beverage (tiny bag of bread sticks juice). The twin-engined Airbus was new and clean the FAs courteous and competent. I'd fly Alitalia on a short trip again.
4046,We caught a connecting flight with Alitalia from Paris to Rome - a very old plane and luckily it was a short flight. Then we flew Alitalia from Rome to NY a very long 10 hr disappointing flight! The TV monitors didn't work and the staff didn't seem to care even after numerous complaints. The food was horrible! Some awful lasagne or chicken. After serving this the staff disappeared for the remainder of the flight and passengers were asked to go to the back and help themselves. Then an hour before landing they served cheese sandwiches which were inedible. The seats not to mention were so uncomfortable and I'm short and even I couldn't stretch my legs out. If the person in front reclined their seat you were eating in your lap. I will never fly Alitalia again.
4047,Traveled from Toronto to Rome Rome to Lamezia August 1 - 16 2013. This Airline needs to get back to basics on how to keep their travelers happy and wanting to come back and fly with them. The staff all need a course in customer service. This is one airline I will never fly again.
4048,I am a 75K elite status on this Airline and fly every weekend and also 1 million miler status since two years ago but sadly have seen a dramatic decline in service. First class not worth the cost. Upgrades even with my status are rare. Food is horrible. I recommend you stick with either American or Delta or United or Southwest for elite status. MVP Gold and 75K means nothing to the airline.
4049,I have been an Alaska Airlines MVP Gold passenger for 6 years. Each year the service and attitude slips in the past 2 years more than ever in crew attitude food portions and quality. The routes I fly for business are SEA-ANC SEA-DCA and SEA-LAZ. Last two round trips one to DCA and to LAX were especially bad. The plane had not been well serviced the food was not up to standard and FA's did not care about the over heated cabin. The sorry truth is that on the SEA-ANC and SEA-WDC flights Alaska knows that they can be poor and still outshine their competitors.
4050,We flew from Bellingham to Honolulu HI and back with Alaska Airlines. On the flight to HI we sat in row 23. By the time the food service got to us (I was willing to pay for food) they were out of the good food and only had things that no one else wanted to buy. Lousy service lousy prices. Late leaving HI for Bellingham by 30 minutes. This airline continues to go down hill. Years ago it was a great airline. Not so much anymore.
4051,I made the mistake of booking my trip to Sioux Falls on Sunday July 19 with Allegiant. When I got to the gate the flt was posted with 25 min delay. We boarded flt and sat and sat there with no ac working. Now of course this is the middle of July in Las Vegas. After approx 20 min flt attendant advised to take out emergency card from seat pocket and use it as a fan! Flt finally left almost 2 hours late it didnt get cooled off on aircraft until we were halfway to Sioux Falls. I will never fly this airline again.
4052,"After our flight was delayed four hours due to our plane breaking down, our flight was cancelled. They gave no vouchers for us even after spending all day at the airport and we were told that they weren't sure when they would be able to fly us out next. Complete waste of time. I will never use Allegiant again."
4053,"I booked a flight in May to spend a few weeks at our condo in Boynton Beach with my family. We were supposed to leave on July 13 from SYR at around 6.15 pm but after a few hours of waiting, including at least an hour in the plane, we were told that the flight was cancelled due to mechanical problems, After a one hour wait we were finally provided with an hotel voulcher and a new flight itenary for the next day at 5.50. We had to get out of the hotel by 11am, so we ended up shopping in Syracuse and got back to the airport around 3.30 pm to be told that the flight was further delayed 10.35 pm. We finally got out at around 11.30pm and made it to FLL at 2.30 am. Really not a pleasant adventure. I just hope that our return flight on July 27th will be more pleasant."
4054,FCO-YYZ in Business Class. Boarding at FCO from a seemingly temporary hall (terminal H) without enough seating space then by bus to the aircraft. Staff courteous but not very well trained or competent. Seats in Magnifica class recline to almost horizontal but still at an angle of some 15 degrees from horizontal which pushes your feet towards the footrest not very comfortable. My own seat could not return to complete upright but none of crew seemed to notice. Moreover pitch and width are less than other airlines in Bus. class. Inflight entertainment is pathetic with portable screens supplied on request. Food just acceptable. Good punctuality.
4055,VIE-FCO-CAI and back. The Flights were horrible. The stewardess don't speak English just Italian. The food was a joke: on the second leg (FCO-CAI) a 3.45 hours flight you get a slice of raw meat and a slice of Cheese and a Fruit salad. The seats have minimal legroom and are not cushioned well. On an 3.45 hours flight no entertainment. Even no overhead screens. The security instructions were shown bye the flight attendants. Please avoid Alitalia even when the price is good.
4056,Cost-cutting measures are showing more and more. Although first class is quite expensive it really isn't worth the extra expense anymore except for the larger seats and increased legroom. Meal service is a shadow of what it used to be just a few years ago. A recent flight from Anchorage to Seattle features a chicken curry salad that was frightful while the nice desserts have shrunk to a small piece of candy. Not impressed.
4057,Terrible Airline cheap with bad service. My plane landed in Seattle for a connecting flight at 10.40pm my connecting flight left at 11.00pm. Though the flight staff announced that all those people who needed to get on connecting flights be let off the plane first none of the passengers complied when we landed. Flight staff did nothing to ensure that folks who needed to get connecting flights got to them on time. I ended up at my gate at 10.55pm though flight staff closed the gate anyway no apology no help.
4058,We flew to Mexico in coach. Both ways they ran out of food and we were at the front of the plane row 8. Trying to get one of the attendants to serve you for a drink is a nightmare. We have flown many times and each time it goes down hill further. Our next flight is in First Class so lets see if it is any better. After reading the reviews I am not holding my breath.
4059,Flight was delayed 4 hours due to computer issue. They had to bring in a mechanic from over an hour away to make the repairs. Employee at the snack bar said this happens all the time. There is always some sort of mechanical issue. The stewardess was extremely rude to my sister when she was exiting the bathroom at the end of the flight. For our inconvenience we were offered 1/2 cupful of snack mix and a small cup of a beverage. The return flight was much better with friendlier staff. Not sure if I would fly this airline again.
4060,"Today and the last 2 times we've flown with Allegiant there have been delays on every flight. We have decided to take our business back to Delta. For the money we pay we should at least be able to rely on flight times, especially when it's a business trip."
4061,"Our flight to Honolulu was delayed for 4 hours with and upon entering the plane we sat for another hour and they offered one free ounce of water. One free ounce, after we sat and waited for their plane to be fixed. Family was traveling home from Honolulu and boarded the plane, sat, then had to exit the plane due to engine problems. They sat for an additional 5 hours in the terminal, then told the flight was cancelled and they would have to make their way to the ticket counter to get lodging and transportation vouchers. It was ridiculous. The airline charges for everything. You must pay to book flight online in addition to paying for ticket itself, pay for your seat selection, and pay for food and drink (including water) on the plane."
4062,Recently flew from Italy to Japan. The flight was ok the service uninspiring and the cabin very tight with little leg room especially for such a long trip. My complaint stands with an agent and Alitalia's policy that convinced us 3 in our party to pay for the upgrade to the seats situated near the door in economy class for more leg room. Because it was an international flight the cost was close to $100 each seat while we had the extra leg room we also had to contend with endless lines of people standing in front of us for the rest rooms people stretching their legs and the constant blare of the bathroom lights each and every time a door was opened. I think it is a terrible policy to charge such a premium price just for a little leg room and I greatly discourage others to think again if considering this additional cost it is not worth it. In general I only would consider using Alitalia again because they offer a very competitive price for the market.
4063,First Class is an expensive joke. An ageing fleet makes for poor seats and amenities. Food is poor - both legs of our first class trip brought the reality that only some in first class are allowed to order from the menu. For both legs we were given food that was unwanted and in fact inedible.
4064,YEG-SEA-LAX both flights were considerably disappointing. Food - all I had was a small snack. Drinks were good. Flight Attendants were hit and miss in responding to requests. There was no inflight entertainment. Seats weren't very comfortable with little to no space.
4065,I filled out everything from seat number to meal preference it turned out to be a waste of time. There is no food other than pricey snacks and the seats assigned at check-in. I was taken back by the lack of free onboard movies instead you have to purchase that too. As well as being turned away from using lavatory in front of airplane - that's reserved for higher paying customers. So not having been on Alaska in sometime I was very disappointed.
4066,"We were to fly back to Pittsburgh on July 13, 2015 at 5.18 on flight 869. We boarded at about 5.00. When we entered the plane, it was extremely hot with 150 passengers. It was 95 degrees on the plane and there was no air blowing from the overhead vents. We waited on the tarmac to pull away from the gate for an hour in that heat. Flight attendants kept claiming the air would start as soon as we got up in the air and would cool down. Everyone was hot and complaining. Finally, the pilot said there was an error message and we had to get off the plane for maintenance to work on the issue. Maintenance showed up and could not fix it, we could not get another plane that night. After two hours they announced that we could find our own hotel up to $225 and would be reimbursed. The flight was rescheduled for 2.00pm the next day, which was inconvenient as the whole day is gone. We had plans for the next day just like every other passenger. The next day, we check in and I ask how to get reimbursed for food and hotel and the airport representative says she does not know if Allegiant is even reimbursing for food anymore. We show up for our flight and once again we don?™t start boarding until 1.40. We notice that it?™s the same plane. As we get on the plane, we realize it?™s even hotter than the day before and even more uncomfortable. Once again, we take forever to board and we start to pull away from the gate. We are waiting on the tarmac for close to an hour as everyone is miserable and uncomfortable. I am pregnant, there were infants and toddlers that parents had to undress down to their diapers just to try and stay remotely cool. The flight attendants started to bring out complementary waters, but only made it halfway through the passengers, so not everyone even got water including myself. The pilot finally starts to take off and then we pull back into the gate. We are told an emergency plane will be there at 6.30, we will receive a $150 voucher per person, and we will receive food vouchers to eat in the airport. Our food vouchers were $8 each, which hardly covers any meal at the increased prices of food at the airport. We reluctantly decide to wait for the emergency plane. The emergency plane arrives and again we board late."
4067,"Flight was delayed four times, for a total of 4 hours. Signed up for text alerts for both our flight and the incoming flight we were waiting on. Only received alerts for the first couple of hours. Allegiant even deleted our boarding passes on their app so used ID's at gate to board. Air conditioning did not work for several rows of seats, while my husband's did not turn off and it froze. If a traveller is not on a tight time schedule to arrive at their destination and doesn't mind being inconvenienced by their poorly maintained planes, their flights are very inexpensive. Bottom line - Allegiant passengers get what they pay for."
4068,"Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6.20pm. The flight was coming in from Fort Lauderdale and was delayed due to weather in Florida. We received no notice at Hancock international of the delay. When the flight finally arrived at about 6.30 we were told there were some indicator lights flashing that needed to be checked out, but we would be boarding shortly. At about 8.30 we were told they were doing some diagnostics and paperwork and the issues did not affect the safety of the plane and the pilot said we would be going. A bit later we were told that the paperwork was still being done and we would be going provided we got wheels in the air by 11.02pm. They had us board at about 10.15 and I must say A 10-15 minute boarding of a full flight was impressive. We were pushed to the tarmac where we sat for about 30 minutes. Eventually we were told they had to power down and restart to reboot the computer. We finally were deplaned and given a hotel voucher but had to pay for taxi to it ($35). Flight rescheduled for 12pm the following day, we finally took off a bit after 5pm. We were given very infrequent updates, lied to about the issue, lied to that another plane was being flown up. You get what you pay for. Low prices and zero customer service. Never again."
4069,"Our flight from Knoxville, TN was delayed by more than 6 hours, so the first day of our vacation was lost. The allegiant to go app. failed to work for me. The reason for the delay was because the flight crew had reach their maximum flight hours and had to rest for twelve hours. The flight itself was very loud. They don't tell you that Sanford Airport is a 45 minute drive to Orlando and the cheapest transport there is a minimum of 90 dollars. On the night before our trip back we received the alert to check in and once again the app. would not work. This time I couldn't access their website either. After several attempts that took about 2 hours I was able to check and get screen shots for the boarding passes but could not print them. Finally was able to email screen shots and print from my email. The return flight was on time and landed without incident. Basically, this airline is a good way to get to your destination if you are flexible (don't mind long delays) have a lot of time on your hands to jump through the hoops to get your boarding passes and don't mind the stress of trying to get your luggage fit with in the size and weight guidelines."
4070,"I have to say that my trip to Rome (from JFK) on 11/8 with a return on 12/4/13 was by far the worst flight experience I have had. Even the lowest of the low-budget airlines provide a better service than Alitalia. 3 weeks before I traveled I broke my foot I called to see if I could get assistance getting on and off the plane. The agent told me ""no you have to request that at the time of booking"". I was in a cast and had a cane I figured someone would help me from the airline. I was wrong again. Not getting on board not in seat selection not exiting the plane in Rome down a huge staircase that dropped us out in the middle of the tarmac. I had to beg a steward to help me which he did grudgingly. The return was easier. When I told the staff member at check in I was at the gate for early boarding because of a broken foot she asked ""Did you ask for assistance?"" I said no because I couldn't get any on my way here I assumed it would be the same on the return she just said ""oh"" and let me board. Again no help offered. On both flights the food was awful. Chewy greasy macaroni on the way over. A block of chicken nugget on the way home. On the one time they passed by with a beverage cart I asked for tea with sugar the steward said ""you already have sugar"". When I insisted I didn't he said well you do. And that was it. No sugar. After that if you wanted something to drink you had to get up and beg for it. I felt like I was interrupting their own private party in the back. The most startling incident though was when the stewardess slammed my window shade shut about 4 hours into the 9 hour flight. I raised it again and said I preferred to keep it up. The stewardess slammed it shut and hissed it was their policy to keep the windows shut! No windows no sugar inedible meals high priced a TV stuck in Chinese (with no way to change it to English) no assistance on or off not what I would call good service. Take American Airlines British Air Aer Lingus Lufthansa Delta Air Berlin instead."
4071,ANC-SFO-PSP-ANC First Class. Flight attendants do not serve first class like first class. It's more like you're time warped back into what Coach used to be like. Drinks on offer before takeoff - tepid water poured out of an open common bottle into a plastic cup. Service after takeoff indifferent. Food not great. Interestingly if you request an alcoholic drink they bring you two mini-bottles of the alcohol but don't bring you the can of tonic/soda/whatever that goes with it so you can mix it yourself. Planes are exceedingly loud with announcements from FAs but if the pilot speaks you can't hear a word. Between that and the thin rocky seats make sure you pack your ibuprofen.
4072,I flew 6 hrs from Seattle to Kona on a full flight. The only toilets for economy were at the back of the plane. Being only one narrow aisle there was continual crowding and congestion up the aisle near the toilets. It was particularly bad for passengers in the back rows because they had people in the aisle crowding them the whole flight. We were not allowed to use the first class facilities at the front even though a couple of people did go through. An other annoyance was the frequency and volume of announcements. Please let us have some peace and quiet! We noticed the contrast with Hawaiian Airlines which was so tranquil and relaxing with no loud publicity of special deals and unnecessary announcements of impending drinks trolley.
4073,"Flight delayed over 4 hours on way from Cincinnati to Orlando with very little communication given as to why. No gate agents able to answer questions. Return flight has been just as bad. Boarded the flight, sat on the runway for over 30 min only to be told there was a light on and we had to return to the gate to have it looked at. Sat on the plane for 20 min and then told the plane needed further looking into. Now waiting in an airport with zero communication as to when a flight may be available. Horrible service. Will never fly this airline again."
4074,My flight to Las Vegas was delayed 4 hours so my first night in Las Vegas was ruined. Now on my way home and they have delayed my flight again! I also paid extra to pick my seat when I initially got my tickets online and they completely disregarded my seat choice so now I have to wait for that to be refunded also.
4075,My first time flying with this airline. Arrived on time (3.30pm) at airport only to find it extremely crowded. Allegiant is the only airline to service Stockton. My flight was scheduled to take off at 5.31pm. The 3.30pm flight was delayed. After checking in we were told our flight was delayed until 8.30pm. The 3.30pm flight finally boarded at about 6.30pm and sat at the terminal for another hour. Our flight finally boarded at about 8.30pm and took off a little after 9.00pm. Once we boarded we found out the aircraft A/C was not working. Our return flight was on time but the A/C was not working on that airplane either. It stayed extremely hot the entire flight. If you have time to waste getting to your destination and like to save money then this airline is for you.
4076,Flew from London to Rome and return. 2hr 15 minute flight. Left London on time at 0645hrs and got a glass of juice and a small packet of biscuits. When did airlines stop giving food or even giving you the chance to buy food. Return trip was at 2030hrs and it was exactly the same. Left 20 minutes late. Captain said it was because of air traffic control. Strange then that I could still see them loading the luggage bins on after the departure time.
4077,On return flight from Maui we sat in the first row behind 1st class. My wife needed to use the restroom and must use a crutch to walk so she went forward to 1st class. I went to the back but was blocked by 10 people in line who were blocked by the serving cart so I returned to the front. My wife had returned to her seat and another lady was going through the door so I waited. Then a lady attendant seeing me waiting told me I must go to the rear. I explained that the aisle was blocked by the serving cart she insisted I go back which I did. After the long wait on the serving cart I finally reached the restroom. When I returned to my seat the man in the aisle next to me asked why I went back. He said while I was gone 3 people had passed him and used the front bath room without any harassment. I realized that this restroom is intended for First Class but at the same time a little reasonable attitude and common sense by the attendant would be appreciated.
4078,"If you need to be somewhere then on time then this is not the airline for you. If you are ok with long delays and no compensation for flights that are cancelled then you could save money flying this airline. The first time we flew Allegiant, everything was fine. The second time, same route, was a disaster. We were scheduled to leave at 7.20 pm and did receive flight delay notifications throughout the day, but my complaint is, the airlines kept us at the airport for hours, promising our flight was ""on the way"" and we would flight out that night. We even began boarding the flight before they decided the flight crew had ""timed-out"". We did not leave until the next morning at 11 am and there was no compensation for the delay. We could have driven to Florida in the time we spent waiting for a flight that didn't happen. I can't believe the airlines didn't know the crew had timed out hours before they told us."
4079,"Don't fly Allegiant unless you are ok with taking a chance on not getting on a flight the day and time you were planning. They are terrible! They delay flights, cancel flights. My first flight with them should have been an indication of what a nightmare this airline is. I was to get on a 4pm flight and they canceled it less than an hour before it was to leave. I didn't get on a flight until 8pm. They couldn't give a reason for the cancelation. The passengers sat for 1 hour on the plane and then Allegiant decided to cancel that flight because of mechanical problems. They said they had to get a mechanic from Salt Lake City and the flight should be ready to go in 2 hours."
4080,"Leaving Las Vegas for a 10.35am trip back home, but without explanation a 4 hour delay. Airline attempt to pacify with a meal voucher. This is very frustrating. Left Brownsville to Las Vegas with a one hour delay. Never again."
4081,Terrible went NYC-Rome. Staff were rude seats were tiny headrest uncomfortable food was awful. Just one step up from Ryanair or Easyjet.
4082,London to Brindisi via Milan out and via Rome back. Haven't flown Alitalia for several years and was shocked at the complete absence of catering services. On all 4 flights there was a very poor selection of drinks (soft drinks only) and absolutely no food whatsoever apart from a tiny packet of savoury snacks - and this even on the Rome to London sector with a scheduled flight time of 2 hours 45 minutes. At least on budget airlines you can buy food - but on Alitalia there is nothing. Plus points are the cabin decor which is attractive and clean and the seats which are comfortable with good legroom. But why this complete absence of catering from the national carrier of a country which has such wonderful food and wine?
4083,We flew FCO-Paris return. The first flight we had was aboard an Air One plane and was very basic. Cabin staff looked dishevelled and were not friendly they looked like they did not want to be there at all. I went to use the toilet and there was no toilet paper toilet stank and looked like it had not been cleaned in years. Flight was delayed an hour and when asking on board what time we will be arriving as we had transfers booked i was told the flight is 2 hours that was all. Very bad experience and as a travel agent I will not be recommending this airline.
4084,Flew nonstop Oakland to Kona. Its a much smaller plane than Hawaiian or United for example but seat size is the same. However there are no movies and music they will rent you small hand held pads. They only use one food cart in coach so if you are at the back you will wait over 1 hr after service starts. Food is reasonably priced. Staff are nice and helpful if you know what to expect its fine.
4085,The airline did got us to the destination however they re-assigned our seats upon check-in - to the lavatory row. I paid full fair for these tickets and spent 6.5 hrs with people standing next to us. When I asked to have my family back in their original seats I was told there was an equipment change. Apparently the computer runs the airline. The computer reassigned the seats and there is nothing a human can do to rectify the situation.
4086,"They used the same excuse as they did my last flight (LAX to SFG) a week ago that there were ""maintenance issues"" that caused the delay. That flight was delayed more than 2 hours (the pilot said we couldn't leave at the delayed time because there was still ""paperwork"" that was being filled out). Now the return flight is delay more than 4 hours. It hasn't even left L.A. Yet to get to SFG, when it was supposed to have been here an hour ago!"
4087,"I'm writing this review as I sit with my family (8 of us) in the Sanford Orlando airport trying to get to Springfield IL. The 1:37pm flight has been delayed 3 times (3:30,4:45pm and 5:30pm) with no reasons given. This comes after a the 2.5 hour delay we had getting here last week. To add to it the flight from Peoria is also delayed currently. They boarded and the plane was not able to fly - so they got on another plane and it overheated. Read all the emergency landings and delays before you buy a ticket for this airline."
4088,Delayed 3 hours on both ends of trip. If you don't mind sitting around airports for hours this is the airline for you! The waitress we had for dinner at the airport restaurant said she makes most of her money on the delayed allegiant victims. Never again.
4089,We walked onto a beautiful new plane the staff was wonderful and the food decent but the headrests were so incredibly uncomfortable and there was nothing we could do to improve the situation - the rests basically push your head foreword leaving you with a bent neck and no back support. I will never fly them again simply for this reason. Check in prevented us from carrying on our luggage - she said my bag was too heavy/large but once onboard it seemed everyone had bags bigger than mine. Onboard staff was nice - attentive and accommodating. The temperature was ridiculously warm and stuffy. The inflight entertainment device was difficult to use and offered limited options.
4090,Puerto Vallarta from Los Angeles. Its only a 3 hr flight. We paid full price First Class not upgrades. First Class it was not. Besides the 737-400 being old and tired my seat was broken both ways. Seat pitch is the tightest I've ever experienced it was impossible to get up with the seat in front reclined. Food was awful there were zero amenities and pre-flight beverage service was water. I had to wait behind coach passengers to use the lavatory both ways despite the announcements alerting passengers about the usage of the front lavatory. The one bright spot was the use of their Board Room Lounge at LAX. Its very nice wonderful staff and plenty of amenities. Alaska needs to upgrade their First Class or go ahead and rip out the four abreast seats up front.
4091,"SEA to LAX. We were seated in first class row 1. When we tried to stow our carry on bags the crew had their stuff in our overhead. This forced us to use the overhead behind us which held those people's bags. Plus we got dirty looks from them. The same happened our return trip. We were appalled when coach customers lined up to use the 1st class restroom - why don't the attendants stop the coach from using the 1st restroom. When we pay for first class tickets we are paying for these ""Perks"" or so we thought. It is not our job to tell coach people the rules. It is Alaska Air's job to enforce them."
4092,"The flight was delayed just short of 3 hours, and after boarding the flight attendants were less than kind or understanding of anyone on their flight. After all was said and done and finally in the air, I asked for a little water. The attendent said they would only sell me water and that was the only way I would be able to get any water on the flight. I was suprised and stated that I was under the impression that all airlines provide water to their patrons. She (the attendent) made sure to correct me and say if I wanted water I would have to purchase it. She was very unprofessional and rude. Allegiant as a whole was a very large let down and I shall not fly it again."
4093,This was a 1st and last experience flying with Allegiant Air. Flying out of Ft Wayne beginning with a 2 hour delay and once all boarded and preparing for take off we had to turn around because of a drunk passenger. Passengers had told Allegiant staff before we started boarding about the lady and staff still allowed the drunk passenger to board. Upon returning from our vacation again we encountered another 2 hour delay. Allegiant staff checking our baggage was very rude to several passengers. Customer service lacked in many areas.
4094,Absolutely horrible! They delayed the flights because the pilots didn't have the paperwork correct. So 12 hours later we are sitting at the airport when we are finally allowed to get on then they told us the plane wasn't working correctly. After 16 total hours of waiting we finally took off. The only thing we got was a free one cup of water.
4095,July 18th. AZ 317: Paris (CDG) - Roma Fiumicino (FCO). AZ 1749: Roma Fiumicino (FCO) - Catania Fontanarossa (CAT). August 2nd. AZ 1714: Catania Fontanarossa (CAT) - Milano Linate (LIN). AZ358: Milano Linate (LIN) - Paris (CDG). As its capital is in some way mainly detained by Air France I was expecting that the airline was at least equal to Air France but it really depends on what flight you take. International flights: service is good it's a bit hard when you don't speak italian they are a bit rude but it does the job. Paris - Roma: average experience. Milano - Paris: very good experience. On national flights (Roma - Catania / Catania - Milano) it really isn't good at all. A321 but inside they aren't clean at all seats are leather trim but in bad condition. There is trash and dust everywhere. When you get onboard flight attendant was there but she was checking something in the galley and did not pay any attention to passengers - totally unaware of customers. This behaviour isn't isolated. It was on the national flight from Roma to Catania the worst flying experience I have had. The national flights really have to be improved.
4096,We flew to Maui from PDX return - flight over was great the flight back seemed to be on a different airline. The attendants were rude and had no desire to accommodate even a very simple request. Also we paid for our bags going both ways and were only supposed to pay going one way that was an extra 40 bucks. We could have just carried them on like so many others. We paid the 14 bucks for a digiplayer but the headphone quality was so bad we couldn't hear anything. We were finally watching a movie that was very old not a new release as advertised but with 15 minutes left in flight and 5 minutes of the movie they took it away. Overall the return flight was a very inattentive and miserable looking crew.
4097,"Allegiant Air has become known as the delay airline. Two (2) hour delay leaving St. Petersburg, 45 minute delay leaving Knoxville on my return flight. I have used this airline countless times over the years, and have even recommended it to friends. This was by far my worst experience flying. First they nickel and dime you for everything, including $5.00 to print a boarding pass, if you don?™t spend the money to down load their app. The lady at the ticket counter in St. Petersburg was really just rude, the seats are cramped and not really that comfortable."
4098,"Flown this airline several times from Clearwater to Des Moines and back. Started using Allegiant 5 years ago when we moved to Florida. In the early days, it was on time, convenient, and seemed to have few mechanical problems. Not so any more. Their increasing habit of nickel and diming their passengers to death is just annoying. Tried to add a carry-on bag and the app wouldn't work so they charged me $50 at the airport. Called customer service, waited 1.5 hours and they would not refund the $50. Next trip to DSM = Southwest."
4099,"I usually fly Delta or Southwest. Despite the reviews I thought I would give Allegiant Air a try. Left from Tampa/St Petersburg. Arrived 1.5 hr ahead of time (yes, saw the 2 hr suggestion but always get through bag drop in 30 min). It took 45 mins to wait in line to drop bags. Just in adequate staff. We had to upgrade one of the bags we already paid for. Got through security just fine but the gate agent threatened to close the boarding door on my wife as I finished in security 20 mins before the flight left. We ended up being delayed leaving the gate because of a technical problem with the lavatory. The attendants yelled at several passengers because the did not put their phones away. They still use the old rule that all devices have be off during takeoff and landing. Not so good for kids. The fair was cheep but by the time you pay for bags and seats and show up early enough, just not worth it"
4100,Check in was in Naples and then short flight to Rome and then non-stop to Chicago on October 26th. Will never fly Alitalia again! Check in person and cabin crew were rude! Not a smile or an interest in doing their job anywhere! Check in person gave me a seat opposite of what I ask for and it was horrible! Cabin staff spent minimal time serving passengers but hours behind a curtain! They did not check bathrooms which were smelly dirty and lacked toilet paper most of the time. Air vents as you looked down the aisle were filthy!
4101,Alitalia is quoted as a full service airline but our recent experience (end of October 2013) would say its really a no service airline. 06.45hr departure in the morning from London 2.5hr flight with another 1.5 hour connecting flight. No coffee or tea was offered (juice or water only) plus a very small packet of biscuits was the best they could offer. The crew spent 80% of the flight (all 4 flights) chatting to one another. Only redeeming factors were all flights were on or close to time and the baggage transferred faultlessly.
4102,Flew first class from Seattle-Chicago this week and was shocked at the poor cabin service. Cabin crew were ambivalent and made us feel unwelcome. The lunch offering - a bowl of soup a bread roll and salad - was very meagre. A very disappointing experience.
4103,"I used to fly this airline and always said it was a great little airline. No more. My 2.5 hour trip from St. Pete to Rockford, IL took about 10 hours and two separate aircraft. First plane was brought back to the gate from the taxi way with ""mechanical issues"". After waiting another 5 hours for a second aircraft, the pilot aborted take off. Ground crews at both airports were very rude - that is if you could even find anyone with an Allegiant name tag, lol! As my final destination was Wisconsin, I chose Allegiant to Rockford to save on driving time once I had arrived. Never again."
4104,"July 22, 2015 Allegiant Air's Flight 548 (LAS-BIL) was delayed 5hrs. Aircraft finally at departure gate A12 and passengers were informed by Gate Agents that boarding would commence as soon as replacement Flight Crew arrived. Passengers stood in boarding line for 1/2 hour when Gate Agents redirected passengers to gate A14, where there was no aircracft. Same gate Agent announced to passengers at gate A10, in line to go to Eugene OR. that their new gate of departure would be A12. Allegiant Air gave the aircraft away and cancelled ultimately cancelled Fight 548. Allegiant Air gave no reasons for cancellation and did not provide commodations or alternate air travel for that date. Fare refunded for that segment."
4105,At 6 ft 5 when I booked my flight in January 2013 requesting bulk head or exit row seats they told us then those were already reserved. Flight from Toronto to Rome was brutal and I can assure you we'll never fly Alitalia again in spite of the fact we travel abroad frequently. The box in front of my wife's seat made it even worse for her. Never again and in speaking to people around us every single one of them had the same complaint.
4106,FCO to JFK Sep 13. Seats booked were ignored. I got a seat both ways with a box in my tiny foot space. Food was bad. Flight was late by about 40 mins. Crew were nice.
4107,I flew from Los Angeles to Rome round trip. Talk about a sardine can! I reserved an aisle seat and got windows. Both ways ended up with an oversized man half in my seat. The food was terrible and so were the flight attendants. The flight was also late.
4108,"Los Angeles-Vancouver on 737-400. Attempted check-in at kiosk but unless you have a US or Canadian passport you need to check-in at the counter. Staff neither rude nor friendly just robotic. Boarding a bit chaotic as passengers push aboard to hog overhead lockers with their gigantic carry-on bags. Was greeted at the door by a flight attendant's back. I said ""hello"" but no response. Proceeded through first class and waited patiently while passengers blocked the aisle stowing their carry-ons. I was happy to wait however a flight attendant shoves her hand in my face and shouts ""wait right there!"" I wasn't even moving! Walked past the first two rows of economy and noticed that they were smashed to pieces with a sign hanging that said ""do not use"". Not a good look. Airplane was totally full and the interior was showing it's age. Drinks and food for purchase served by frowning unenthusiastic cabin crew. Flight arrived on time baggage delivery fast. In the end they get you where you're going but like most North American based carriers staff are rude and unfriendly."
4109,We paid to fly First Class from Portland to Hawaii. Seats aren't much better than coach little leg room and hard seats. Inattentive flight attendants. No welcome drink prior to take off and the cabin was served drinks before we got ours. We used the call button and were told our FA was busy preparing our breakfast. Breakfast was fine. Digiplayer didn't have much of interest to offer. FA's disappeared after breakfast and were gabbing away. We rang again for another drink after about an hour and were ignored. Rang again and were berated for abusing the call button. Will never fly Alaska first class again stick with Hawaiian.
4110,"SEA-LIH-SEA. Flight out was OK. We were allowed to sit in our assigned seats. Hard to sleep because of numerous really loud announcements about buying food joining the frequent flier club signing up for a credit card renting a video player etc. Flight back was bad. When we checked in online the day before our return flight we discovered that Alaska had changed our seats from our nice aisle seats to poor ones. When we called we were told that it was too late to do anything; we should take care of it at the airport. That we had written confirmations of our seats which we had repeatedly reconfirmed meant nothing. At the airport check-in line we were told we had to go to the gate. At the gate we were told it was too late to do anything. The gate agent was apologetic but said ""it happens all the time."" Everyone we talked to basically said ""I don't know why this happened. We are very customer oriented. I can't help you."" Flight back was notable for the sleep robbing announcements to sell the same stuff. Does an airline have to wake everyone up to find out how many are flying on miles so they can sell more credit cards? Couldn't sleep much anyway; seat didn't recline."
4111,First class Seat 4D on Seattle/Chicago run was horrible coming and going. Like sitting on a concrete bench. Not acceptable for First or Business Class. Also what's with the Board Room restrictions? I suffered a 6-hour delay at O'Hare but American (partner in the lounge) would not let me use the lounge without a Board Room card. With a delay of any length they should give complimentary day passes to premium customers. On the plus side Alaska cabin crews are the nicest in the business and food is really good.
4112,"Plane was delayed because of a mechanical problem, fixed it, took off and had to return to Vegas because of overheating on the engines. We were told there was another plane flying in from Stockton to replace this one at 5pm. Plane from Stockton did not come, we were given $8.00 food voucher, by that time only place open was Burger King. We were told we would be put up in hotels for the night. Our group's hotel was never confirmed in the end we had to find our own hotel and transportation, there was no communication at all, we were just left. We finally got to our hotel around 11pm that night. Next day we were suppose to be on a special flight at 5:10pm and home by 7:45pm. They boarded us late then we had to get back off the plane because there was a fuel leak. We finally took off at 6:30pm - not recommended!"
4113,"My flight was scheduled to depart at 7.30 am. Now it's 2.15 pm and we're still waiting for the plane, they changed planes because the original had mechanical problems that they didn't realize until after we boarded. The funny thing about all of this is that I took the same flight last fall and was delayed 6 hours because they diverted our flight to a charter. They only reason why I booked a trip with them again is because they gave me travel vouchers. It was not worth it. If you read this, don't book a flight with them or if you do, expect a high probability of delays."
4114,"The boarding was delayed by 40 min followed by sitting in the aircraft for almost 2 hours. I booked this flight as I wanted to reach NY early for the July long weekend but by the time the floght started, it was already the time I should have landed. Please don't book by being fooled into the cheaper fares, it is not worth it."
4115,The plane is old and the washroom is horrible. Needs a lot of maintenance. Fortunately it was just a 2 hour flight from Amsterdam to Rome. Staff were not professional they ignored calls from customers during the flight. They just stayed at the rear of the aircraft talking among themselves.
4116,In September we flew London-Rome-Catania return. The outbound flight from London was reasonable. We didn't see much of the crew. However on arrival in Catania my luggage did not appear until 2 days later. The return flight sector from Rome to Catania was deplorable. About ten minutes after take off I went to the rear toilet and noticed the 2 flight attendants sitting there with the curtain pulled reading the paper. The toilet smelt badly and there was no toilet paper. I advised the flight attendant who thanked me but did nothing about it as my partner used same toilet later and still no toilet paper.
4117,"ANC-SEA-SFO-SEA-ANC First Class. Outbound uneventful and reasonably good service in First. Back was another story. Surly male flight attendant who was uninterested in serving in First Class. No service for the first 90 minutes of the flight. Service when it appeared was lackadaisical at best. No refills of drinks. Flight crew sat in jumpseats ignoring passengers (including me) who were trying to use restroom. Restroom appeared occupied for long period of time. Turned out the flight crew just couldn't be bothered to turn off the ""locked"" sign for about two hours of a three hour and 20 minute flight. I am looking forward to competition in the Alaska market arriving this summer."
4118,"They have great prices , but once you book, you'll find a charge for selecting any seat on the airplane, having any type of baggage with you, and printing your boarding pass at the airport. If you want to actually take advantage of that 75 dollar flight, you must travel in a swim suit with your mobile boarding pass on your smart phone. Why did I continue to fly this airline? Because for a while, it was the only airline that I can find that went to my destination. But it began with 2 hour delays on the flight (they seem to only fly one plane in one route all day so if the first plane is behind, the entire day is lost). Don't expect anyone to be at the counter if you arrived 2 hours before your flight is supposed to leave. You must show up 2 hours before your flight is scheduled to leave because one of their favorite pastimes is making you wait on them. Once you actually board the plane (4 hours later) it's not so bad. The flight attendants are pretty nice."
4119,"Customer ""service"" is the worst. Despite purchasing Allegiant's flight insurance, one must call the airline to make any changes. Wait to speak with a human is routinely over one hour. This low budget airline needs to spend just a few dollars to provide even a minimal level of service. Some ground service personnel are clueless and unprofessional."
4120,Flew from Toronto to Rome and then Rome to Toronto (end of Sep). Not impressed. Food was terrible condition of plane was poor and customer service let's see was non existent. As many others have commented they serve drinks then dinner and then they disappear for 5.5 hours. Even if someone pushes the bell for service they just ignore it. Unbelievable. Waited 2 hours to get our luggage in Toronto because they needed to search the luggage before they released it. Will never take them again.
4121,We recently flew from LAX to Rome and back in premium economy. The aircraft was clean comfortable and on time both coming and going but the crew from the ticket agents (check in) to the flight crew were somewhat rude and at times non existent during the flight. We were served on time but the food was inedible and the trays were not picked up for nearly an hour. My wife asked for a cup of tea and waited nearly 45 minutes to get it. This kind of service is totally unacceptable and we will not recommend Alitalia to anyone in the future.
4122,SEA-LAS. One of the very few direct flights to Las Vegas from Seattle so choice is very limited. I ask for very little on a short haul flight. There was a free soft drink and the usual packet of indescribable pretzels. Decent seat size and overall a clean aircraft. Landing at McCaron improves any flight as it is one of the best domestic airports I have ever been to. Functional though unspectacular.
4123,"We fly Allegiant often. Typically no problems. No frills, which is fine by me. The only issue with Allegiant is with calling customer service. The last time I was on hold for 45 minutes and gave up. Today, I have been on hold for an hour and 15 minutes and counting. I know they want everything self-service on the web. Sometimes getting help from a rep is required - today is one of those days."
4124,The attendants at both airports and on the airplanes were nice and helpful. Very smooth flights on time both ways but we had an issue when my husband booked the flights and had to wait on the phone for around 3 hours before being able to talk to someone to resolve our issue. This is ridiculous. There were 3 of us and because of no customer service on the phone we will probably not fly with Allegiant again - too bad everything else was good.
4125,Stranded 2 families in Sanford. Had to rent cars to get to Clearwater and fly to Harrisburg and rent cars to ABE. Cost of car rentals inflated because a whole flight was cancelled.  These were not cheap tickets at $400 per person.
4126,"Flew Alitalia from Rome to Lax on September 4 2013. Nice newer Boeing 777. They got us home safely. And the entertainment system was good. Otherwise the flight was less than satisfactory. Absolute minimal effort on the part of cabin crew. Lazy lazy lazy. Food Terrible. I was in Business class Ask for a Bloody Mary ""Sorry only beer or wine"" Entire cabin crew hiding somewhere most of flight. Walked all the way to the back galley to find a Stewardess. Again she informed me only Beer and Wine were available. I am still confused by this. I will avoid Alitalia in the future."
4127,Our flight from MAN to JFK was cancelled due to engine issues which resulted in us having to rebook and we ended up flying via LHR. Our rebooked flight was with British Airways which was much better as they offered individual inflight entertainment systems unlike American who are still on an old system of overhead TVs. Our flight back from JFK was delayed and when we eventually got on board the aeroplane was quite possibly the oldest plane I have been on with a cabin crew to match. After 10 minutes the pilot informed us that a member of American Airlines staff had attempted to open the cabin door when it had already been locked which resulted in the life raft falling off the plane! We had to all disembark and after an hours wait we were told our flight was cancelled and we would need to rebook. We were put on flight the next day via Dublin which resulted us being over 24 hours late home. Appalling service and we will never travel with them again.
4128,OGG-PDX-LAX and OGG-SEA return. We live on Maui and use both Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines to travel. This is a new market for Alaska and we hope they continue to improve their service. These flights were okay - standard mainland business class. Food was average. Service was good and attentive. What is lacking is a seat with better pitch foot rests and pillows or blankets. Hawaiian Airlines give you a seat with about 140 degree recline leg and foot rests and pillows and blankets. Both airlines are attentive to needs but Hawaiian has the edge with unsolicited water drinks etc. Costwise Alaska charges about $300 less than Hawaiian. For the money and the additional comfort I want Hawaiian is the better deal. But keep trying Alaska.
4129,"Returned on Alaska Airlines from Kauai HI. We had barely left the ground and it was announced ""no fresh fruit"" - yesterday's only. Then midway through the flight we heard ""the system is out of water. There will be no more water to drink and please try not to use the toilets unless necessary - who goes into an airline bathroom unless it is necessary? I am only guessing but I think that if there was no time to get fresh fruit on board or enough water to last the flight perhaps the preventive maintenance wasn't done either. No apologies for lack of supplies and of course no coupon for future use."
4130,"We were delayed four hours on our flight out of Northwest Arkansas for mechanical issues. On our return flight, we were told we would be delayed for 30 minutes because our flight attendants hadn't made it from California. About an hour later, we were told there was going to be another delay due to the cabin temperature being 100 degrees. They were needing to try to cool it down. It was so hot when we finally boarded, and it was about 35 minutes on the tarmac. We then are excited to finally land at XNA, and they tell us they are very sorry another plane is at the unloading bridge. It will be a few more minutes. Ten minutes later, they tell us there is another plane in front of us, and it will be another hour sitting on the plane as it quickly starts heating up again."
4131,Today is 6/28/15. My flight was to leave at 1:30pm. At 12:50 I got a courtesy notification that my flight is delayed and would now leave at 6pm. It also said flight time is not certain.  Now I can't reach their call center. And it may take more than 1 hour to get an agent to pick your call. So I booked my entire round trip from another reliable brand to fly out today. It sure is a very costly lesson to learn.
4132,"Three hour delay from Pittsburgh. 1.5 hour delay returning home. Staff were not very friendly. The low fare is a farce as there are so many add on charges for things that we paid more for our flight then friends who flew JetBlue during the same period and arrived on time both ways with free carry on, free drinks and snacks and TV."
4133,"Flew from Vienna to Rome on 24th September at 11.20 am which took about 90 minutes. We were served a drink and a small packet of something that the Italians should be ashamed of. I asked one of the flight attendants if we would be served lunch (since it was at lunch time) and was told ""no"". Very poor."
4134,This had to be the worst flight I have taken. We travelled in Premium Economy. The aircraft was clean and on time but everything else was terrible. The check in personnel in both Los Angeles and Rome were rude. The flight attendants were not much better. They served the inflight meal and returned only to pick up the trays and that was an hour later. They never returned to pick up trash or ask if we needed anything else. The food was poor and inedible. This was my first and last trip on Alitalia.
4135,I flew Alitalia 4 times in the past 4 days. First flight was from Tirana International Airport to Rome Fiumicino on Sep 19th. Flight took off and landed on time so I guess this flight was pleasant on an A320. There was a choice of salty/sweet biscuits and a drink Pepsi/Water/Bravo and wine! Then I flew from Rome Fiumicino to London City Airport. I was travelling with my family and upon reaching our gate at Rome Airport we decided to check in towards the end because of the large lines of people waiting. For no reason whatsoever no bus came to pick us up for the next 30 minutes. Flew an Embraer plane to London which was rather odd considering the duration of the flight. I then flew yesterday Sep 22nd 2013 and the flights had similar problems. London-Rome took off at least 30 minutes late because of a busy runaway. Plane was an A320 once again and the flight was uneventful. Then from Fiumicino I flew to Tirana again on an Airbus A320! Flight to Tirana took off 1 hour late! In general I would fly Alitalia again.
4136,"We flew from Boston, MA to St. Thomas U.S.V.I. on July 14th 2015. Flight #1619 from Boston to Miami was our first leg of the trip and that went smoothly. Then we got onto flight #2421 from Miami to St. Thomas. It was delayed a half hour. We landed in St. Thomas still being able to make our ferry to Tortola. However, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes for all of our luggage to be deplaned. During this time three other planes landed, all of their luggage was sorted out and the passengers from those planes left the terminal. We found one of our pieces of luggage was still in Miami. Our flight came in at 3.30pm, originally supposed to land at 2.57pm. It is well know that ferries stop running from Charlotte Amalie at 4.30pm. American should have done everything in its power to get people on their way. At least one third of the passengers were in the same situation as us. Four others lost baggage. My son spent the next morning trying to reconnect with his luggage and were told we would have to make a trip to the ferry terminal to pick it up. Now on to our flight home, July 25th 2015, we arrive at the airport three hours before our flight. The six of us were flying from St. Thomas to Philadelphia, PA on flight 837 leaving at 3.05pm. We arrived at the airport at 11.45am. We went to the kiosk and got our plane tickets and then joined the extremely long line (1.5 hours), at the ticket counter, just to get our luggage tags."
4137,"Be well warned that if you cross the Atlantic with American Airlines, they are likely to put you on a small 3x3 plane with absolutely no entertainment system. I was charged $85 for a few pounds luggage overweight where practically any other airline crossing the Atlantic would have let me pass through with it."
4138,LAX-PDX roundtrip. Service on this trip was better than the last few times I've flown this airline - in other words it went from dreadful to mediocre. Flights were on time and the interior was comfortable enough but inflight service was perfunctory and cold. At least this time I was spared the flight delays dirty cabins mishandled baggage and pitiful customer service I've come to expect of Alaska Airlines.
4139,SFO-ANC. Economy class flight was fairly good. The crew was courteous and efficient. The cabin was clean. Flight was on time and checked bags came fairly quickly.
4140,"LAX-MFR via Portland in first class. Both flights on time. Staff very professional. The ""light meal"" seemed rather skimpy since this flight took place around dinner time."
4141,"Flight cancelled due to mechanical issues. Passengers waited on plane an hour, then deboarded and were not told anything about the flight for another hour when told it was cancelled. Told something would show up in email. At the time no alternative flight. Later that night after alternative plans and an email appeared that told of a replacement flight the next afternoon. Most had made alternative arrangements since Allegiant did not usually fly on Saturday from Indianapolis. Told to call customer service for refund. Hold time greater than two hours. Took a full day of multiple attempts to get through. Very poor effort at informing consumers, very poor customer service. Will not fly again, saving $30 is not worth 2 days of hassle."
4142,"Departure and arrival times seem optional and unreliable. I fly frequently, but this was my first my last Allegiant flight. I literally spent more time, both going and returning waiting out the delays than I did actually flying. This airline is perversely committed to making the passengers rue the day they opted to fly Allegiant."
4143,"Good news for anyone who wants to gamble. You don't have to go to Las Vegas to gamble. Just buy a ticket on Allegiant Air. They may or may not get you to the destination. And they may or may not do it in a timely manner. And just like Vegas, if you lose your bet, Allegiant does not want to hear any complaints. Was scheduled to fly from Knoxville to Fort Lauderdale for a weekend. 24 hours before my flight was to depart, I got notification that it was delayed. Then 2 hours after the original departure time, it was delayed until the next day. I spent hours on hold trying to speak with customer service. I sent emails to their contact us email. The website says they will get back to you within 24 to 48 hours. My weekend has come and gone, still no contact. There is absolutely no expense wasted on customer service. There is absolutely no regard the customer."
4144,"My wife and I were in a group of 47 travelers flying Alitalia from New York to Rome and return. We have been on hundreds and hundreds of flights but our experience Alitalia recently is perhaps the worst ever. The primary reason was the seating situation. We were flying economy plus but most of the group was in economy. Not only were seats jammed together but they did not recline. It appeared they were moulded plastic seats with cushions that slid down a bit to offset the lack of replying. It was agony. The entire group without exception were totally negative on the seating situation. several of our group found themselves in seats that had metal boxes on the floor so they could not extend their legs fully. 'Breakfast"" on our return flight consisted of two pieces of cake. Coffee was consistently lukewarm. Stay away from Altalia at least on their JFK to Rome service."
4145,AMS-FCO. I'm not impressed by Alitalia. I tried many airlines of the last months but this was my worst experience. Poor seat comfort. The crew came only once with water and coffee. They were very rude and were completely not interested in the passengers. Plane was old but the flight was on time.
4146,"My flight was scheduled to leave at 7.45 to Newark after it was delayed twice, we finally boarded close to 9pm. The staff did not give a reason as to why the flight was delayed and then told me that all other flights to Newark were booked up."
4147,Seattle to Kelowna BC and the boarding procedure was chaotic. They boarded three flights at the same time through a single gate. Upon arrival at the aircraft boarding zone there was no clear designation on which flight was which. As a result many passengers boarded the wrong aircraft and had to change planes shortly before departure. The same system applied to loading luggage which of course ended up being lost. At my destination I was told to expect a call from the central luggage department but this never happened. I called and got different versions on the status of my luggage: the first agent said it would be here on the afternoon flight the second agent said it had been scheduled but they were not sure whether it had arrived or not and the third yet most unprofessional representative Linda simply hung up when I asked her if anyone could guarantee that my luggage would be sent on a specific flight. It's sad to see such substandard logistics management for Alaska Air because the in-flight service was outstanding. Undoubtedly I will be sure to avoid this airline on my next trip to Canada.
4148,LAX-BLI one way combination of Alaska and Horizon Air. This flight was better than my other experiences on Alaska/Horizon which isn't saying much. Nothing went wrong but the fare was higher than its competitor Allegiant Air and the onboard service and seating were poor. The unionised drone cabin crew couldn't care less about the customer. Horizon Air's DHC-8-400 props are noisy and uncomfortable. Allegiant Air despite their very inconvenient scheduling offers better service and better value for the money.
4149,"Low base fare, but be prepared to pay for a 3% credit card surcharge, $34 for your choice of individual seats among a limited range, $5 for a single boarding pass, $35 for each checked bag, $50 for each bag being over-weight (no inspection seal on scales). After 5 hour flight to Hawaii, we had to wait 35 minutes on the runway because of mismanagement concerning available gates to unload. We missed our connecting flight. Caution, schedule at least 2 hours for transfers in Honolulu. The airport is a joke. Good reliable aircraft, but you cannot get a cup of water for less than $2, on a credit card. Snack food only, so bring a peanut butter sandwich. Seats do not recline."
4150,"I arrived at the airport 2 hrs early to find out the flight was cancelled with only a 2 hr notice. They put us up for the night in an awful motel. While at the motel other people that missed the flight informed me that some people took the later flight, and there was a flight going out at 10am. So I went back to the motel and waited 2 hrs to talk with someone about the 10am flight instead of the 8pm. Many other people had to go to other airports that night to keep from missing cruises, etc. The flight on the way back was 2 hrs late to top it off.  So, the price was good if you have time to burn, but I will not be using this airline again, since it cost me more money to miss the seminar, not to mention the aggravation!"
4151,"I will never fly Allegiant again. They don't have a customer service desk and will never refund your ticket. They delayed our flight over 5 hours and the most they gave us was a $50 voucher for another Allegiant flight and $8 meal voucher which is hardly enough for a meal at an airport. Don't be fooled by their cheap tickets, they will charge you for everything else!"
4152,Toronto - Rome - terrible service on board. Do not care service any entertainment available beside central old style TV on the middle of cabinet turned on after five hours of flight playing inappropriate movie for my kids. I will recommend a one stop flight instead of using direct flight with Alitalia.
4153,FCO-CDG-FCO. Departures and arrivals on time the flights were pleasant both times on a A321. Staff professional but worked without smiling at all food service requires an improvement only a packet of sweet or salty biscuits and a drink. I will continue to use Alitalia again for my next trips.
4154,"Because of a delay caused by weather we missed a connecting flight. However thats' not the issue. We arrived at Chicago late and missed a connection to Greenbay. We were put on a standby flight to be told that it was unlikely that we would get on. This was a Sunday evening. When we pressed for information about the next flight, we were told that this might be 8.30pm on Tuesday, as if this were not a problem. Pardon, not a problem! A family of three in the middle of Chicago, stranded for 3 days. There was no help at all. No useful information as to where we might go, what we could do, what transport we might be able to get. We were stranded and they did not give any assistance at all. It was a crisis for us."
4155,"This review is about their ridiculous process to get credited for miles on their and their partners flights. Last week, it took me all of ten minutes to ask United to credit me for flights I flew on SAS Airlines, and all of two days to credit my account. I flew Iberia Airlines in November - filled out my request for miles from American in December - didn't hear anything by March. So I asked again, and now I have been asked for receipt, name, boarding passes, and advantage number - three of which I have provided, and the receipt is really moot at this point. Honestly, I believe this whole issue is because I have an apostrophe in my last name. Every time I tried to add my AA number to the reservation before I left, I was told, ""The last names don't match"". This is ridiculous."
4156,"I cannot think of one good reason to fly American Airlines in the future. I cannot think of one reason to keep any credit card that only allows redemption on American as well. Customer service is becoming almost fight as they are not willing to negotiate or explain or accommodate customers anymore. I paid 178.00 cash to buy three thousand aadvantage miles for a $200 ticket, due to all the fees, they even rewarded me 5,000 miles for my purchase. Every single customer service rep I spoke with told me I should read all their fine print online to add up the fees prior to booking. I could not cancel even within the first 5 minutes. They are aggressive and used tactics trying to make me feel I was inadequate in my booking purchase. Yikes. No reason to fly with them again, their prices are not competitive and their rewards program is not user friendly nor offers half as many perks as other airlines."
4157,"I gave AA a one star rating because I had to choose something. Otherwise, I would have given it a negative. This was my worst flying experience and my children's first flying experience. We were supposed to fly out Sunday morning at 7.45 am and due to a mechanical issue the flight was delayed (at first) and ended up getting cancelled. The next flight out was full, so we had to take the next available flight at 4.45. Spent all day at the airport waiting to start our Orlando vacation. I was thinking this would be the worst part of our trip - but it wasn't. On the way home - our flight was delayed yet again. We flew out 2 hours after our original flight was scheduled, which caused us to miss our connecting flight in Chicago. There were no later flights, so we had to stay overnight. When I asked them about a room, along with many other passengers, we were given a discounted rate at a hotel 15 miles from the airport. The discounted rate was $75 and they didn't offer to pay for a cab (the shuttle wasn't running this late). Rather than taking the room, we slept at the airport. Definitely not what you wish for your children's first flying experience."
4158,"Vancouver to Portland on Horizon (Alaska Air's partner for the short hops on puddle jumper planes in the Northwest) on a Q400. Check-in went well with assurances that the flight was on time. Then once aboard our plane we sat and we sat at the gate until the pilot informed us that there was a mechanical problem. The passengers were allowed to return to the gate and await the problem's resolution a two-hour delay on a one-hour flight. Although the crew thanked us for our ""incredible patience"" no compensation of any kind was offered! Upon arrival in Portland I sought out a gate agent requesting compensation. She helpfully offered me a $50 travel voucher or 2000 mileage plan credit. The moral of this story-always ask for compensation even if not offered up front."
4159,Due to booking a flight with Delta which sold the seats on Alaska beware. Alaska does not honour your original seats even though you resubmit and get confirmation of seat assignments. We had bought tickets for row 10 for my wife and I - Alaska decided to leave me in row 10 and at first had my wife in row 22 then row 28 after complaining the lady at the Kiosk put both of us in row 30 - the very rear. They do not seem to care much about customer relations. The flight was OK - on time etc.
4160,"My husband flew out of Indianapolis, delayed 4 hours on June 1st. Coming home today (June 13th) from Punta Gorda, the exact same thing. Because of plane issues. Absolutely ridiculous."
4161,"We fly from KY to FL frequently on Allegiant because the fares are low. However, be prepared for virtually 100% of your flights to depart and arrive late, sometimes an hour or more. Also, if you have to change your itinerary, forget it. Just throw away your ticket since you can not make any changes, even for a fee online. We have waited on hold for hours trying to connect on the phone to a customer service agent only to be disconnected when their automated system tried to connect us to a representative. This happened multiple times. So if a Greyhound bus with wings with no service in the air on on the ground works for you, then Allegiant is your airline. Checking in with luggage is a hour long ordeal as well. The prices w/o extras or luggage are compelling and the experience then is bearable."
4162,"Allegiant Air is definitely cheap. My husband's plane was delayed on his way to LAX and again on his way home. On his way home, it was because they had no co-pilot. As I write this review, we are still not sure that he will make it home today or how he will make it home at all. He may need to buy a ticket on another airline."
4163,We flew from Toronto to Rome and connected on to Tel Aviv. We then flew return. These flights however were truly awful. It is the YYZ-FCO routes that were terrible. I spoke to many different Alitalia contacts to find out beforehand if there were personal TVs on board and was told each time there would be as these were all new planes. When we arrived at the airport in Toronto we found out it was A330 AirOne flight we were taking. It was one of the oldest and dirtiest airplanes I have been on. The ash tray between the seats was filled with chewed up gum the seats had no cushioning there were no personal TVs and it was just all around dirty. While I picked up dinner in the airport my family got the on board meals which looked awful. Yes we got there safely but the dirty plane awful meals and lack of personal TVs on such a long flight made it a terrible flight. On the way back again very old A330 but this time I think the state of the plane was even worse than the one going there. While we chose our seats months in advance we ended up with 2 rows of 2 right in front of the WC and the last row did not recline at all. They had changed the plane so that the configuration we chose from was not the one we flew. This plane was even dirtier with yellow padding under the seats showing duct tape to hold together some of the seats. The attendants came around once in 10 hours with water. The first meals was provided right after take off and the second more than 8 hours later just before we landed. We will never fly Alitalia again long haul. Our short hauls between FCO and Tel Aviv were an A321 newer and just fine. So we'll fly a short haul but never a long haul.
4164,"Flight from Rome to Boston in Premium Economy. Clean cabin food below average FAs with a ""do not care"" attitude."
4165,"The aircraft was old and dirty. The cabin crew did not engage with passengers, (they only seemed interested in chatting to each other about their layover in London). The aircraft was freezing cold but they refused to notice that the passengers were wrapped up in hoodies and blankets even though passengers complained. Tickets are expensive and additional charges are applied for a second suitcase, if you want to choose a seat and $9 for an alcoholic spirit! The food was nothing short of disgusting. Many passenger bought their own packed lunches. The IFE was like something out of the 70's. Overhead monitors with no choice of movie. Tiny in-ear headsets were begrudgingly handed out to passengers unfortunate enough not to have brought their own. American Airlines are complaining about unfair completion from middle east airlines. Given the choice I would fly on Emirates or Qatar every time!"
4166,"Every time I fly on an American Airlines they lose my luggage, and the planes are always broken. On my way back to MO last time, the plane was delayed in Phoenix for 4 hours, before they finally switched us to a new plane. They still managed to mess up getting my luggage back that night. This time, my flight left an hour late because of AC issues. When we land in Dallas for my transfer, I went from a 45 minute layover, to run as fast as I could to catch my gate. Got there as the door was closing. Turns out that didn't matter, because there was an issue with this plane too. Apparently, one seat was not functioning. I will never fly AA again."
4167,"It took 37 hours to get to our destination. It was suppose to take 18, or so. My confirmed booked tickets, for my wife and I had two transfers. One in Dallas and one in London. In the end it was 3. Our plane to Heathrow was late and we missed our transfer, so when we got off our plane at Heathrow an American employee gave us new transfer tickets and told us to hurry to our next gate to catch it. So we ran to the next gate which took 30 minutes (Heathrow). When we got there my wife looked at the tickets and the layover was 4 hours. So why did the employee have us run? Because the flight was to Florence, not Pisa and they probably didn't want us to notice. So we went back through security (1.5 hours, Heathrow) and we got new tickets through American through British Airways to Pisa. We had about an hour wait after another run through security (1.5 hours) and back to the proper gate. So why didn't American put us on this flight in the first place? They work with British Airways to get customers to Pisa! Since we got back I contacted American about this issue, they sent us a voucher for $200 for a luggage mess up on the way home. It didn't have anything to do with the sending us to the wrong city."
4168,Flew with Allegiant to Maui. We left Bellingham 4 hours late so I missed my connection. Cost me a night in a hotel two taxi rides and the cost of another flight to Kona on the Big Island. I have never sat in a seat so cramped. I am only 6'2 but my knees were nearly above the seat in front of me. Luckily no one sat beside me and I was able to swing off to the side. Yes the flight was very cheap. It was not worth it. Alaska would have been nearly $200 cheaper with all the other costs I endured. Have not flown with them again nor would I recommend them.
4169,"Two different flights: AZ300 and AZ305 LIN-CDG-LIN as a Skyteam transit flight. Flights both on time. Crew were not really that nice. On the return flight the crew waited until descent to serve and this caused confusion onboard. Everything was good for a 1.5 hour flight but the thing I can't stand is the check-in service in Linate. I had a skyteam ticket on multiple airlines (AZ/DL/AF). Each site of the selected airline pointed me to each other and when I was able to do it on the AF site the tool didn't make it possible to change seats. Called AZ and they didn't answer called AF in Italy and they didn't answer called AF in France and they said the entire site had a problem so it was impossible to check-in online. Went to LIN ground staff pointed us to the compulsory ""self check-in"" that surprise didn't worked either. Finally they let us check-in at the usual desk and everything was good. If there are strict alliances between Airlines at least give passengers a good check in tool for every flight!"
4170,Milan-Rome-LA. Classica plus on long haul. Domestic flights good both ways and on time. Flight going to the US 18/7 was on time and in general a positive. Priority boarding at Rome nice and easy good start. Enjoyable flight with nice friendly professional cabin crew. Food was good. After all we were leaving from Italy (shouldn't make a difference but does). Large entertainment screen and audio were very good. Comfortable seat with that all important extra leg room. Nice on board kit with good quality blanket. Return flight to Rome from LA 9/8 and what a difference. Same airline but a very different and this time negative experience. After over an hr's delay at LAX boarding started where priority boarding just didn't exist! Once on board we were greeted with very rude cabin crew who could hardly smile! This continued for the whole flight. Just rude and couldn't care less attitude from the crew. Food inedible and cold. Thank goodness for the snacks available throughout the flight at the back of the plane. We were three in classica plus 2 tickets on miles and one full price. Good on miles but not worth the cost of a full price ticket.
4171,"I am a US college student currently in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I was traveling from Columbus, Ohio with connections in Washington and Miami. I board in Columbus without any problems however once on board I dealt with rude flight attendants. The flight to Washington arrives to DCA on time, I had enough time to board my flight to Miami, where I boarded without any problems but once again faced rude flight attendants. Arrive in Miami 20 minutes delayed where I was called up to the counter by an agent where I was asked to switch seats with another passenger because a family was traveling. I paid extra for this seat because all that was left was the preferred seating, I asked the agent if I would be moved to a preferred seat, she said yes. I get in line to board and am told rudely that I was in boarding group 4 and that they were only boarding group 1 at the moment. I paid extra to be in boarding group 1 and will never again switch seats with someone. Finally am able to board and the safety video plays on the screen on the backs of the seats. The pilot comes over saying that there are two minor problems that need to be taken care of before we can take off. After waiting for over an hour the pilot comes back over the intercom again to explain that we need to deplane. So we got off the plane and wait at the gate for another hour before we are finally told that the flight won't leave until 11.30 the next morning. After waiting forever to speak to the ticket agent and was only offered a transportation voucher. I had to pay for a hotel in Miami."
4172,"American is usually okay for me but they aggravated me this time around. I'm assuming the airlines set the flight times. We had a 2 hour layover which is usually enough time but due to the size and unecessary complexity  I already reviewed the airport separately) of Miami airport, it was not enough time and we had to run to make final boarding call. I feel like an airline should understand times and how each airport is and should not schedule flights if they know it will be almost impossible for their customers. We were so close to not making it even though we were responsible with booking the layover times. If there is such a risk of passengers not making it don't schedule flights for those times! Part of the problem was the need to claim baggage and recheck it which we were not informed of when we booked the flights. It took far too long for our baggage to come and there was no one around to answer questions about whether or not more baggage was coming. Then after running to make it we still didn't take off on time. We sat for 30 mins at the gate while they fixed some problem in cargo. Some smaller complaints: they did not serve snacks on any of their flights for this trip and they did not show any good entertainment. They kept showing show after show instead of movies and not any good shows either that are popular."
4173,Anytime I have ever flown with American Airlines there has always been a way to go above and beyond of making flight travel as miserable as possible.  I'll give American Airlines the benefit of doubt. Not all of the people who work for American Airlines are rude. They will acknowledge you if you are persistent and polite enough. When I was at the Denver Airport I was not impressed with the agents. The flight crew did their best to help me. They were able to inform me that I would miss my connecting flight to Pittsburgh. There was only one agent who seemed to address my issue in concise and respectful manner - other agents were rude. I don't need outstanding customer service.
4174,"Overall our experience flying Allegiant was pleasant and as expected (flew from PIA to PIE). They are very particular and charge for every ""extra"" along the way but to be able to take my family on a direct flight from our local airport at such a low cost is worth any perceived hassle. Flight out was delayed by about 30 minutes return flight arrived early. We were traveling as a party of 6 (including 1 lap child) and were able to get seats together on both flights even though we had not paid for assigned seats in advance. Not sure if this was because the flight was not full or if we just lucked out. I had to check in at the airport with our infant so got a paper ticket there but needed to check in the rest of the group using their app to avoid the $5 ticket fee. The app had assigned seats all together when we checked in. Unfortunately on the way back we were running late to the airport and they close the online check-ins 60 minutes before departure so we were forced to pay the $5 fee for the additional tickets (the agent gave us all seats together without us even asking). We choose to take two checked bags and each had a personal item. I was surprised by the very small dimensions for the personal items they didn't seem to be monitoring closely the size of these at our airports but I wasn't wanting to be caught with a surprise carry-on fee so we made sure our luggage fit within the size limitations. We did get caught on the way back with one overweight bag but they gave us an opportunity to move things into our personal items to avoid the extra weight fee. Total cost for 5 round-trip airfare tickets with 2 checked bags was"
4175,I recently took a trans-atlantic flight from Chicago to Rome with my two kids and it was the worst experience in customer service. Horrible treatment by cabin staff who constantly behaved as if they're being forced to serve and were taking it out on passengers. The choice and quality of the food and beverages was poor. Will never fly Alitalia again if I can help it.
4176,"I haven't flown with AA for a while and my July flight to AA is the most horrible experience I have ever had. The aircraft is not clean and new compared to other airlines like UA or JetBlue. On my flight from Dallas to New York City, I was asked to check my carry on baggage before boarding (I am the last few to board) saying there is no enough over seat space. But after boarding the airplane, I found that there are much more space near my seat and there is no need to check my carry on. On my experience with JetBlue, the flight attendee will arrange the carry bag space for you. "
4177,"My plane was diverted from DFW to Shreveport, LA, left on the tarmac for almost 3 hours and then abruptly cancelled. No flights out meant that everyone was stuck and no rental cars were available. No help w/ hotel costs or car rental. Will never fly American again"
4178,"We were set to travel from Vegas to Dallas then to Orlando then to Gatwick. The nightmare started on our first flight, flight was delayed due to cabin crew being late, when we got to Dallas we had missed our connection due to the previous flight delay, we then get told we can go on the next flight but it was fully booked so we would be put on standby. We made them aware we had more connections to get to, they couldn't of cared less! After my partner explaining we needed to get home due to commitments etc they put us on a direct flight, after they booked it then told us it was to Heathrow airport which is 45 mins from where our car was in Gatwick. Advised that the airline would pay for our bus journey so we took it. When we arrived in Heathrow our nightmare continued as American airlines had now lost our luggage. When we realised the luggage was missing we went to a help desk just to file a report and to be told to go home and our luggage should arrive later that day and all will be ok. Well I've been home a day now and numerous phone calls to American Airlines have not been helpful to us."
4179,April 2015 - South Bend Indiana to Punta Gorda FL. The extra charges are absolutely ridiculous - we pay for our seats for our carry-ons to take it inside the plane extra 100$ if we want a carry-on to be checked we pay extra charges if we pay with credit card we pay even for a printed boarding pass. All these services are free on major airlines. And then the flights are very frequently very late. Our flight was 5 hours late. Awful service the worst airline. They advertise the lowest prices but all the extra charges added up to a final ticket more expensive than Delta and it's not worth it anymore. Also be aware that if you reserve rental cars through Allegiant when you pick-up the car you will pay all the taxes that have not been added to your ticket and these are substantial. I will not fly Allegiant again and I wouldn't recommend it.
4180,New York (JFK) - Rome (FCO) on 7/23/13. The plane was very nice and clean. However the service was terrible. In New York we approached the counter at the gate to fix our tickets because our seats were wrong. We told the lady working there and she said that you have seats and you should be happy. I have children and they were seated in different parts of the plane. Eventually we began to argue with the worker because they ignored us and we had to beg with another for our assigned seats. Once again the plane and food were fine but the blankets were dirty and smelt terrible.
4181,Chicago O?™Hare to Rome on 7/20/2013. Flight AZ0629. Rome to Istanbul Ataturk on 7/21/2013 Flight AZ0702. Istanbul Ataturk to Rome on 8/11/2013 Flight AZ0703. Rome to Chicago O?™Hare 8/11/2013 Flight AZ0628. Not thrilled with our experience. The meals have very little in them and didn't fill us up at all. Crew appear to be unhappy with their job. Service is extremely slow. Smiles are rare. If you express your opinion on something ask for extra food they become defensive. My husband's headphones wouldn't stay plugged in my daughter's remote control wasn't working. The blankets that come in a plastic bag didn't smell clean at all. I doubt that they were washed. The restrooms smelt bad and looked dirty. Planes were old. The tickets were cheap and you get what you pay for.
4182,We flew to Amsterdam through Rome and came back yesterday following the same itinerary. The planes were in bad condition all 4 of them and there was no food served on any of the 4 flights. They just offered us some cookies or salty crackers and a drink. On our way to Amsterdam we were starving. My friends flew to Amsterdam with Aegean through Munich and they had 2 hot meals!
4183,"Service: Flight attendants were surly and unhelpful on every 6 flights we took last month. After sitting on a hot plane 45 minutes late in departure from Rome to Toronto I asked an attendant to please ask the pilot to make an announcement and give customers some information her answer was ""He's too busy to make an announcement"". Food service was late no water available unless you got up and went to the back of the plane. Food: The worst in the world. Snacks are nutritionally awful and are always served late. Seats on the flight from Toronto to Rome were falling apart fabric ripped in many places seats dirty no magazines or information cards. Few toilets were working properly. Entertainment: There was one screen that comes down which was hard to see. There was one movie on a 9-hour flight. In short a memorable experience on Alitalia. A very bad one."
4184,"Flight from Boston to O'Hare, fair to good. Basic experience. AA did not handle the flight delay well in O'Hare - assigning late inbound pilots who were near time-out for active service on an already delayed departure flight to an airport with a curfew time. O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later. We ultimately returned to a different gate due to timed-out pilots for our now cancelled flight but then they didn't have the staffing available to open the gate and get us started with rescheduling flights for an additional 20 minutes - blowing any chance of catching some of the last flights to Southern California for the night. It was just one setback after another. My recommendation, if your flying AA - stick with the hub in DFW, at least they may have the extra resources there to keep things moving. I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help, a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight, and just not a whole lot of explanation. Yes, the rain did cause part of the delay, but really no responsibility was attributed to the airline for the other factors that weighed into the cancellation. I am now flying home on a competitor along with at least 5 others I recognize from that fateful night."
4185,"A depressing experience. Flight delayed nearly 4 hours with no explanation. We went through a secondary security check so water purchased after primary security was confiscated. I should be grateful that AA takes security seriously but several people came through that check with water not found by the baggage checkers. The cabin crew were rude, unfriendly and very unapproachable especially when we needed water. There were passengers in the front seats who we assumed were airline employees. They were given priority treatment with much joking with the crew. All very unprofessional. At take-off and landing there was very little attempt to ensure seat-belts fastened or seats upright. To get on to a British Airways ongoing from Miami was a true joy."
4186,"Flew from Vegas to Chicago O'Hare, en route to Buffalo. Was informed via voicemail my next flight was delayed and then another canceling. I called the given number to get booked for the next flight it was not until 8.30 am. She said I would get info through email that never came. They had cots present to sleep on but failed to mention they wake you up at 4am. Sat at my gate for 4 hours just to find out they had changed it without me knowing about it so I had to run to my next gate. I got there with 10 minutes to spare but they closed the gate, would not let me on, and said that my ticket had not been issued when I had it present on my phone. Next flight was not until 3 pm, luckily was on standby at 12 pm where I managed to get on an ""overfull"" plane last minute. Arrived home 14 hours later than I paid for. Used their gogo service and paid $6 for a movie that cut off after 30 minutes, no refund. They don't even offer complimentary peanuts on a 4 hour flight. Never will fly with them again."
4187,Flight staff were standoffish. Flight 990 PGD-IND and flight 991 IND-PGD. The air was blowing in around the oxygen panel to the point that we had to be moved mid flight to another seat. Even though we were delayed 2 hours the sign at either airport never read anything but on time. The driver on the other end had no idea we were going to be two hours late. Had to board the plane from the stairs at the back of the plane! The plane was so cold coming home you could have kept meat frozen. The Air nozzle was broken and couldn't be turned off. Plane was full nothing could be done. I finally shoved a piece of paper in it to deflect the cold air. The captain spoke so fast that he couldn't be understood. Will I fly with them again - no.
4188,Our experience with Alitalia was very poor. We paid extra for seats with more leg room only to find that because of the extra space passengers as well as the staff used this room as an aisle so we actually had to keep our feet tucked under our seats so that people weren't tripping over us. Then the overhead lighting didn't work nor did the audio equipment. We found some of the staff to be extremely unfriendly. Gate line ups were very chaotic. Would never fly with them again.
4189,"From Istanbul to Rome on June 29. Check in agent for Business Class refused to attend us though is clearly mentioned that they ""welcome"" passengers flying Classica Plus at this counter. Returned to the queue and once attended was informed that my suitcase was with extra kilos. So I had to explain and teach to the agent that as I was coming from Brazil I was allowed to carry 2 pieces of 32 kg each and not 23 kg as she was trying to convince me. They don't even want to have ""the job"" to read carefully the e-tkt before mention such a thing. Third trip with this airline and always with issues."
4190,"Our flight was delayed 5 hours due to a bad computer part. We were repeatedly given inaccurate information about the length of the delay. Told AA had to get the part from UA, then told part had to be flown in. Then part was on UA plane in hangar. Told it would take 5 minutes to swap out. Took an hour to remove, another hour to install and then testing began. After 2 hours of delay, given $12 meal voucher. You can't even buy a pre-made sandwich at ORD for that amount. Missed our connection and the rebooked one too. Trip that should have been 16 hours to my home took 24 hours. AA gave me 5000 air miles, which costs them nothing."
4191,"ORD-MSY, 1st July. Online check-in was swift and simple, no delays and friendly ground and air crew. Basic plane so no wifi or IFE but it was only a 1.5 hour flight so can't really complain. A bit of a bumpy landing in the rain but very well-handled by captain and crew. Was served a complimentary drink but no food, but again only a 1.5 hour flight. Would happily recommend AA to others."
4192,I've been flying Allegiant for years now between Ft. Lauderdale and Knoxville TN. No delays in the last year so I'm pleased (lucky!). The trip last week was my first on the different plane and I just hate the new seats. Hard and too straight my back was so achy I couldn't wait to arrive. I don't suffer back pains so I know the seats were the culprit. It's bad enough that they're so narrow but now they're like a board. It's not a long flight but must they make the ride so unpleasant? Don't they know how to make seats a little more comfortable?
4193,"Flew from Honolulu Hawaii to Las Vegas last night on flight 1050 with 13 family members. Flight was delayed 5 hours due to maintenance. I understand things happen beyond the airlines control. After sitting in the airport for 5 hours we board and find out no complimentary anything - not even water. Again totally fine. But when I am paying full price for food and drinks and the flight attendant assisting is beyond disrespectful to not only me but other people on the flight making comments like ""didn't the snack cart just come around?"" to a guy who was in the bathroom and missed it. Was extremely disappointed in the customer service I thought they were just rude to me. When someone is paying for over priced food and drinks after sitting in the airport not knowing if we are even going to be able to fly today. At least show some customer service."
4194,"A party of 9 family members flew from several locations around the US to Rome and Italy for a vacation. 4 of the members flew back from Rome to the US yesterday on Alitalia. The 4 who flew Alitalia were disappointed with the level of service on the plane. Meals were noticeably sub-par when compared to the service 2 weeks earlier on other carriers and the service provided by the carriers flown by other members of the family. Surprised at the announcement 4 hours before landing that ""drinks and snacks are available at the rear of the plane."" We also noticed that the staff made one sweep of the cabin collecting food containers. Anything after that was not picked up. As we deplaned the plane looked like a park after a rock concert: paper napkins cups and wrappers everywhere. The cloth seat covers were soiled and in poor condition. The only good thing I can say is that the pilots did an excellent job. Flight and landing were smooth."
4195,LHR-FCO-FLR-FCO-LHR in a mixture of Business and Economy and a mixed experience overall. Check-in at LHR was a little confusing and I recommend looking out for the special check-in area (not signed) for business passengers. I found the food offerings on Business quite disappointing and the business lounges pretty poor. Nevertheless the service was pleasant and the short flight from Rome to Florence quite an exciting experience.
4196,"First they changed my flight time in London so my layover was 5 hours, then I get to Chicago and they wait until the last minute to change the gate which was a 15 walk from the original gate. They changed my flight time there to another 5 hour layover then the flight was delayed again to leave at 9 pm. Because of AA my travel time was 31 hours in length with no apologies. No one wants to help or answer any questions they don't care about the passenger I will never fly AA again."
4197,"Awful plane, dirty, very cold, unresponsive crew. I am platinum with this lot but it is out of necessity. American Airlines really is the bottom of the barrel."
4198,"First Class on A321 Transcon. Ground service was excellent. Flagship Check-In was fantastic, very spacious and modern space away from the crowd. After check-in, I was escorted to the front of the TSA Pre-Check Line and was done with security in two minutes, although I wish the agent was more jovial. Flagship Lounge great with plenty of breakfast options and an extensive beverage selection. The lounge was not crowded. Seating was comfortable and WiFi was fast. Overall, a great space with much better food and drinks than the regular lounge. Flight was good. Seats were spacious with tons of storage. Power ports, USB plugs, remote control and a bunch of other features located by your seat. Seat was private, minor complaint would be the firmness, wish there were a lot more soft like the ones they have on the Boeing 767-300s. TV screens were huge, great interactive map with plenty of entertainment options. The purser was interactive and friendly, although they lack some finesse. She dropped my appetizer on the floor and constantly spilled liquid on my tray table.  Food in abundance, they also introduced a new menu that I got to try out. Appetizer, main and dessert were all good quality, although nothing memorable. Salad was extremely disappointing. It tasted and looked like leftovers from a prepackaged bag of salad and the dressing was oily. Overall, food could have been better although for a flagship route, American should step up their game, considering Delta offers excellent inflight meals on shorter flights. All in all, the flight was great. Excellent ground service, good service, great seat, although food needs some improvement."
4199,Our flight from Rome to Toronto (FCO-YYZ) was a 9 hour flight and there was no inflight entertainment. For a 9 hour flight!
4200,June 8th Rome to Genoa. Tried to check in through the machines available however all of them were unable to make the procedure due. Had to stay on the line for check in. Once at the gate passengers were informed that the flight was delay due to the late arrival of the aircraft in Rome. (No more information provided). Only on board captain informed us that due to an emergency landing of an another aircraft one of the two runway was closed. Due to this fact we had to wait around 1 hour with the doors closed awaiting the clearance for push back. Can't blame Alitalia for this but the ground staff procedure was unprofessional at least. Actually we stayed inside of the aircraft still on the ground for almost 2 hours. Once again at least I was expecting someone to advise me to buy some food before boarding the aircraft. For a flight of 40 minutes it took almost 5 hours.
4201,In June we went on vacation to Italy and as we had a multiple city itinerary only this airline could serve us without the hassle of connecting flights. Outbound flight from Sao Paulo to Rome was uneventful however the seat pitch of the Premium Economy definitely does not exist. It only goes a bit down and that's all. If you are lucky and get the first row then you'll have more legroom otherwise save your money and fly on economy. Prior to take off you got a travel kit and a glass of juice or sparkling wine. The main meal though better presented was mediocre. I pre ordered a vegetarian meal totally uninspiring. No taste no sauce. Arriving in Rome the baggage claim was delay because the ground staff could not open the compartment.
4202,"The flight was okay. Legroom fine, snacks were okay, the average you would expect from a domestic flight. However, let me emphasize on the poor baggage handling on this flight. We arrived at the Terminal, 4-5 hours before boarding time, just to be sure. We were allowed to check-in. However, upon arrival at our final destination (STL), our bags were not with the plane. They were not on any of our flights! As it turns out, our bags never left New York.  We thought that being very early for our flight guaranteed every detail to be fine, including our luggage. However this event was truly a disappointment.  I still would recommend this airline to other people, as my other flights were fairly average, and didn't go wrong like this one."
4203,"Toilets were fine, seating was good. Food average (but at least there was food!). Great staff, pilots and overall a good experience. Some issues with our baggage as it appears our baggage never left New York (ORD to STL was a connecting flight from JFK). This issue was resolved quickly as our 4 pieces of luggage were delivered free to the place we were staying at in St Louis. Overall, our flight with American was fine."
4204,"Firstly, the transatlantic flight from BHX to JFK had no IFE, the staff service was inefficient and toilets dirty. Why on earth use a glorified 737 for long haul? After the flight from NYC to Dallas, which was delayed by 1hr, the final leg - Dallas to Lima was the same as above - with the added extra of a broken AC socket. Now I have found out that American have taken us off the return flight of MIA to JFK (then BHX) and given us a detour of MIA to ORD, ORD to JFK, so now have 3 stopovers, without notifying us. Awful."
4205,There is a reason they only offer flights that no one else does. They have more hidden fees than any airline I have ever used by about triple. You pay outrageous bag fees fees to choose a seat fees for in-flight snacks fees for boarding passes fees for a carry on. Make sure you don't take full size luggage or anything but clothing or you will be over the weight limit. Overall flying with Allegiant was the worst flight experience of my life. No inflight entertainment or even the option to purchase it.
4206,LHR-FCO-CTA return in June. Overall it was a good experience but in the months between buying the tickets and the actual flights they changed our itinerary 3 times. This was due to departure time changes and eventually cancellation of the domestic leg. These changes were communicated to us in email and in Italian language without offering alternatives refund or assistance. Bag drop at LHR a bit chaotic as Alitalia operates several flights in the morning and it seemed not enough desks were open. We ended up waiting 40 minutes in the queue before getting fast tracked along with other passengers on the FCO flight. At FCO they seem to operate a coach service for every single flight. One flight out of 4 was significantly delayed (FCO to LHR). I liked the generous legroom on board. No sandwiches given out like BA does on European flights only a small pack of crisps and a drink. Flight attendants were professional and helpful. Despite the above issues I would fly with Alitalia again as they were helpful and professional when needed.
4207,Flew Sao Paulo - Naples (connection in Rome-Fiumicino) June 2013. Flight attendants sometimes rude. Tried to upgrade from standard economy to premium economy but the upgrade cost was twice the cost of the entire ticket. Seats 20A and B. Seat 20A had a large box under the seat in front of me that really bothered me on the long flight. Catering was ok. Flight to Naples 3 hours delayed due to a hard landing at Rome airport that closed one of the runways.
4208,"Rome - Chicago June 21st Business Class. Plane was an A330 almost new. The ""Magnifica class"" is very comfortable the seats are spacious the food is excellent. The entertainment system was good. The problem was the staff. We were diverted to Detroit because O'Hare was closed for a thunderstorm. The problem is that we were left alone in the Detroit airport for about 7 hours without any kind of news or assistance. The crew just disappeared with no explanation. Very unprofessional!"
4209,"This was the worst experience I have had with an airline and if at all possible, I will choose another airline for my next travel plans. We had a delay and then cancelation going to Montego Bay and the same (but worse) on the return flight. On the return home, we missed our connecting flight in Charlotte because there was congestion on the runway. The next flight was not for three hours. Then that plane was late and needed repairs, so after seven hours in the airport, we finally got on a plane to fly the 45 minutes from Charlotte to Atlanta. The airline offered us nothing, no vouchers or anything else, for causing us to miss our connecting flight. We just got attitude from the employees."
4210,"We arrived at Reagan Airport from LaGuardia to connect to an 8.40 am flight to Los Angeles. Predictably, the flight was late arriving, which was fine, as the connecting flight to LAX also was delayed. To 10 am. Then 11 am. Then the sign at the gate said to check at 3 pm. The aircraft was having ""maintenance"" issues which I learned only by calling the Platinum Desk. The plane was removed from the gate and taken back to the hangar. We were told we'd be boarding at 3.30 pm. And some of us - perhaps 10 - did board, only to be told to disembark. The pilot had ""timed out"" after waiting around all day like the rest of us. A few minutes before 4 pm, another pilot showed up and boarded the plane, but he strode off after a few minutes. The flight was then canceled altogether. I managed to secure a seat on a 6.17 pm flight to LAX via Chicago. In the meantime, I complained to a gate agent about the inadequate service and ""surly, ill-mannered, uncommunicative"" agents. The flight to Chicago eventually took off, and we connected from there to LAX, arriving at the California airport around 11.15 pm. My original itinerary had me arriving at 11.29 am. No explanations, apologies nor compensation. Just an awful experience all-round - and all too typical."
4211,"Coming off flights with Qatar Airways, I was on my last leg to New York with American Airlines. To start, the boarding began 20 minutes late because a previous American Airlines flight to Seattle was delayed. CDG is a shocking airport. I wasn't looking forward to the old B767 that we would fly either. But flight took off on time and wasn't that bad. I slept most of the time, partly due to a lack of personal entertainment. The only entertainment was an overhead screen showing some terrible movie. Crew was good, particularly one. Can't remember his name but you'll know when you meet him. Food was okay, main meal was decent, the ice-cream and snacks were excellent. Flight landed on time. So all in all a very average flight, but I won't recommend it."
4212,It is worth booking with Allegiant only if you book early for the best possible deal and do your homework. I did not do the former but was glad I did the latter (which if you're reading this you are also doing.) Pack light or the charges add up. Bring food and fill a beverage container after security or the charges add up. Print your boarding pass before heading to the airport yup more charges. Finally keep your expectations in check. This airline is a means from A to B not a 'travel experience' on which to build memories. There's no in-flight entertainment or free food. Best for relatively short trips that do not require frequent washroom use. Oh and contrary to many reviews here I found the crew to be attentive good-natured and even humorous.
4213,Chicago to Naples: No place to keep baggage / tight seats / no inflight entertainment / seating area lights (above each seats) were not working. Flight crew disinterested. All in all - I tried to save some money and instead got pennies worth of service for a few dollars less. Naples to Mumbai: just about the same - dirty seats food was not up to the meal request I made. Insolent staff. Toiletries for the rest-room were consciously missing and in spite of passenger complaints to the same - they were not replenished just because they weren't loaded in the first place. It was a 1 hr transit.
4214,Sao Paulo to Nice (connection in Rome) on the business class (AZ0675 14 June returning AZ335 22 June). Airplane was broken and the only person available to give any information took hours to let us know what was going on. The next flight was the next day at 7am. When we arrived in Rome we had missed our connection we had to pick up our luggage and take a bus to a hotel. Nobody was there to help us. On the flight back to SP there was an electrical problem the seat didn't work so I spent 6 hours with a broken seat and didn't get any sleep at all. The movies were old.
4215,"Our flight from Miami to Boston was supposed to depart at 7.45. We did not leave the airport until after midnight. Nobody was offered an explanation as to why we were delayed. We had not one, but 3 gate changes, and our party was traveling with someone who needed assistance. The airport in Miami is huge and after the last gate change, we were told that our flight would leave in 30 min. The AA agent made one phone call for assistance and then left us to our own devices. We had to frantically scramble to find a golf cart, wheelchair, someone to assist. Many of the other passengers on the flight were outraged and not one AA representative gave us any reason why our flight kept getting postponed. Finally, when we boarded at 11.30, the pilot explained that extreme weather kept us from leaving on time. Not sure if I buy this explanation, as other flights departed, but at least he offered an explanation and an apology. Not even a packet of peanuts. Our original departure point was Aruba, and we'll fly JetBlue next time."
4216,"Flight cancelled from JFK to Cancun. I have had mobile app downloaded from American Airline's website that told me all the time the flight was on schedule. Arrived at airport to see on the boards that flight cancelled. Directed to counters to deal with and maybe try and book next flight. No apology, staff were unhelpful and counter staff downright ""offish"" to the situation. I was even told the mobile app doesn't communicate with flight counter so its information can be incorrect. So the question is what's the point of the app if doesn't provide up-to-date info. Flight booked for next day. So we incurred cost of overnight near JFK and incurred cost of night at destination. No offer to assist with accommodation for overnight caused by the cancellation. We were made to feel as if we as the customer was an intrusion to the non-operation of this flight. I lost my confidence with the airline, and return flight from Cancun to Dallas, the flight was delayed by almost three hours. So we had cancelled flight, then our scheduled return flight to connect with another international flight was delayed by hours."
4217,"Flew American Airlines from Tokyo to Chicago, 11-hour flight. We were a little delayed, but that didn't matter, the pilots did their best to make up for it and we arrived 45 minutes before the estimated arrival time. The flight was full, and as usual, the airspace around Tokyo Narita was congested, and there were about 7 planes queuing in front of us to take off. The little TV screen monitor that they had on the seat in front of me was tiny, and didn't have very many shows to watch. But, the staff were extremely friendly, and they had multiple drink options. I was seated in the window seat of row 41, and I had to try to climb over the person sitting next to me, who was sleeping, in which I failed. If you can find a flight with another airline, I'd probably take it."
4218,Tel Aviv to Rome on an A321 business class May 20th. Seats are tight middle seat not used in business class. Plane was dirty. Back of seat showed streaks from spilled food/beverages. Even before plane took off I went to the rest room behind the cockpit. It smelled terrible. After takeoff staff rushed to hand out drinks and food and then set the rest of the trip. For a 4 hour flight there was no in flight entertainment. I will never fly them again.
4219,Chicago to Rome to Naples. From Chicago they put us on a very old Air One plane. Seat comfort almost non- existent there was no padding they were so old the seats and carpet were dirty old and unravelling at the edges. One of the worst flights I've been on. Flight from Rome to Naples very nice clean and comfortable. I guess Alitalia doesn't think you need to be comfortable on a 8-10 hour flight. I'll never use them again.
4220,"Booked 5 American Airlines flights on January 13, 2015 for 4 of us going fishing in Alaska, flight out on June 24 and return on June 25. Called airline reservations agent in order to book flight and to specifically book seat assignments. Received confirmation January 13, 2015 for all. American Airlines changes outbound flights to a different route on May 20. Did on-line check-in on June 23 and discovered there were no seat assignments - AA refused to acknowledge or change to requested seats. AA as usual requests kiosk check-in at airport, even though we had boarding passes in hand. Newly kiosk issued boarding passes were not acceptable at any of the boarding gates and we had to re-check in at the boarding gate to receive a gate acceptable boarding pass. Bad, unpleasant, un-acceptable experience."
4221,"We didn't fly from Manchester to New York as the flight was cancelled. We sat on the runway for 2 hours whilst the pilot waited for maintenance staff. We were then de-planed without a single apology from the staff. We had to go back through airport security as if we had arrived in the country! All our duty free was taken off us. We then had to re-queue at check-in for over an hour and a half, staff were rude, brusque and aloof. Told that our only options were to cancel altogether or fly 9.5 hours later to Heathrow via British Airways. As we only had 3 nights in New York we would lose a third of our trip. We asked to come back a day later so we would actually get the trip that we had paid for, meaning adding on the day we lost onto the end of our holiday but they wouldn't honour this. We had to pay for our own additional night at the hotel in New York which they gave us 15 minutes to decide and organise. We flew back with American Airlines at the end of our trip and even on this flight staff did not smile and were brusque."
4222,"My family had the most frustrating experience trying to fly to Toronto for a week-long vacation with United Airways (post-American Airlines merger). We bought tickets a month before our flight and ended up paying almost $700 each roundtrip (for 4 of us). On June 21st we drove 2 hours to Charlotte Airport and on our way we got an automated call telling us our flight had been cancelled for maintenance (at around 11.30) on a beautiful, clear day. Not knowing what to do we continued to the airport terminal and through the check-in line. The employee at the check-in said we had been rescheduled on a flight for the next day at 5.30am. This wasn't an acceptable alternative for us so we were put on standby for a 4.30 flight but then we had to check-in our stowaway luggage. We asked how we would get our luggage back if we didn't make it on the 4.30 flight, and were told that the luggage was marked for standby and would not be put on the plane without us. Past security we checked with other United Airways employees who assured us this was the case. These employees were all helpful and patient with us. We waited in the airport for hours for the standby flight, which unsurprisingly did not have space for all 4 of us. We were sent to baggage claim and waited for luggage that never showed up. Our bags had been sent to Toronto YYZ without us. I called Toronto Pearson airport where a helpful woman connected me to the United Airways baggage office. Finally I was satisfied that they probably weren't going to send our luggage back to Charlotte, and we drove up north. At Toronto Pearsons we found customer service who made a call and told us exactly where to find our luggage. A 1/10 rating is generous."
4223,To say that this is an economy airline does not really label the airline properly. This is amateur hour. I am sure that they have some terrific flight attendants. I sadly did not get to meet any of them. Be warned none of the seats in the plane recline. Like many airlines now they charge for bags. Unlike any airlines that I know they limit the weight to 40 lbs. not 50 lbs. If a bag is 41 lbs. they charge for a full extra bag (if you have a 41 lbs. bag it costs $100). They charge for water. Our flight was delayed because they had not calculated the fuel requirement correctly and had to send 4 flight attendants and 2 ground crew up and down the aisle again and again counting the passengers. Unlike any other airline I have used one is required to turn all electronic devices off. Airplane mode is not acceptable. Unlike any other airline that I have used no one is allowed to use any form of electronic device during take off and landings. While that was common place 10 years ago that has been proven to be unnecessary on every other airline. The planes are old and well worn. I had never used Allegiant before this past weekend and will never use them again. I did not save that much money to make it worth while. Extremely disappointed.
4224,Flew from Allentown PA to St. Petersburg Int Airport Fla. on 1/31/2015 returned from St. Petersburg Fla to Allentown PA on 2/27/2015. Both flights going and returning were two hours late not a good thing! My wife and I were totally surprised how we were charged for everything from boarding passes to seats luggage food and beverage on the flights. The extra costs made flying with Allegiant not so cheap!
4225,I have flown Allegiant for 5 years lately they have cheapened everything up cut out flights from the airport they used to serve charging for everything they can think of and in the last 6 months 3 out of 4 of my flights have been delayed several times one was 4 1/2 hours without so much as an I'm sorry! I will be using someone else from here on.
4226,Indianapolis to New Orleans 2-12 flight #755 2-19 flight 754. I fly a lot. This is truly the worst airline I have flown with. The only plus is that it was not stop. Both flights were delayed. Minuscule personal items one per person. There is a fee for a carry on and the small dimensions must include the wheels handle zipper luggage tag and anything else protruding from it!
4227,Business Class from Rome to Buenos Aires was simply dreadful. No separate business class boarding - just had to join the scrum. Lounge in Rome was overcrowded hot smelly and had no food except for 3 bowls of cold rice for which they had at least provided a public microwave. Food onboard was no better. Despite flamboyant trolley service only the lukewarm pasta in tomato sauce was edible. The veal main course was tough and the vegetables tasted of chemicals. Incredibly Alitalia carry no gin vodka or whisky on board - only wine and a few cheap Italian liqueurs. The inflight entertainment simply did not work at all - which is a serious problem on a 13 hour flight. Breakfast was a hard roll and a dry croissant and a pot of inedible cherry jam. We were hungry when we landed. Throughout the crew were arrogant and offhand only really interested in chatting amongst themselves. All in all the worst business class experience I have had.
4228,ATH-FCO-VLC. On the flight from ATH-FCO the cabin staff were very unfriendly. During the safety demonstration the cabin attendant was chewing gum. The onboard service was very poor. Alitalia offered a salty or a sweet snack. FCO airport saddens me. Very old dirty and chaotic. Airport staff very rude transfer was smooth. The FCFO-VLC sector was better. Cabin crew were a little bit friendlier than the previous one. Catering was exactly the same like ATH-FCO sector. Aircraft were quite old (former Air One aircraft). The only reason for choosing Alitalia was the ticket price.
4229,I flew out from Pensacola on June 23rd at 4pm. What was supposed to be a connecting flight in North Carolina turned into a disaster. My flight kept getting delayed with minimal communication of when our flight would be taking off. The flight time continued to change and hours passed by with little communication as to why. The flight that was suppose to board at 9.40pm did not get cancelled until just before 2am. I had already been traveling for 14 hours. I waited in a ridiculously long line only to be told that the hotels in the area were all booked and that the cots at the airport were taken. I did not sleep at all. I had to re-route my original flight from LAX twice because one of the workers routed me to San Jose which was 6 hours away from my destination (LAX). They re-routed me again an hour out of the way at John Wayne airport and had to find someone else to pick me up because of the change of my arrival. When I arrived my checked bag was nowhere to be found. My bag arrived a few days later. I have flown with US Airways / American Airlines many times but this customer service is completely unacceptable.
4230,"American Airlines displayed appalling customer service to its stranded passengers in PHL on the evening of 30 June 2015. Several of us were late by minutes to connecting flights to Europe, after being encouraged to run to catch our connections, all flights left without the 15-20 of us. These things sometimes happen, but what followed was not acceptable. Customer service representatives had no solutions for anyone, other than bookings for the next flight 24 hours later. No hotel, transportation, nothing. My service at the desk was dismissive: we can't help. We have no solutions or contingencies. It was only after my pestering them, when she handed me the dreaded ""pink slip"" - a generic phone number and website for ""discount"" on a hotel. The biggest problem is that customer service failed spectacularly at the point where the client is most vulnerable and alone-in transit. There should be a representative for each imperiled connecting flight, or group of flights. On-ground coordinators should be communicating with gate agents and in-flight attendants. Even when connections are simply impossible, let us know and give us options, at the point of debarkation. All it takes is for someone to actively monitor and question the line."
4231,"They decided to detour and refuel the plane in Austin. As a result, the plane arrived almost half an hour after my connecting flight to LHR had already left. I was told the next flight wasn't until 3.30 pm the next day (being today, I'm sitting in the airport), leaving me almost 14 hours between flights. I couldn't afford a hotel. I was given no vouchers for food or anything else, was given minimal assistance, just a slip of paper and ""hope they have room for you on the next one"". Re-figuring my pick-up at Heathrow was more expensive and inconvenient than I could really afford. The airline was less than apathetic. The entire experience has been appalling."
4232,"We booked a companion certificate through the old US airways. We missed the outbound flight and had to take an alternative one way flight. When checking back in for the original return flight, American said there was no reservation in the system. As a result of not making the first flight, American told us we broke the contract, they canceled our reservation without notification to us and we had to purchase another full fare one way flight to get home. In addition, we were stranded for two more nights in the airport hotel. This was insane! Who treats their frequent flyer passengers and credit card holders this way?"
4233,Planes going and leaving were delayed because of issues with their planes. The fleet is very old had no inflight entertainment offered nothing to guest without requiring money and the experience left an overall bad taste in your mouth. If you fly with them download and register boarding passes and luggage early or you'll pay dearly for it. I won't fly with them again. Welcome to Indianapolis.
4234,February 20/15. Just returned home from a RT flight and package from Niagara to Fort Myers. I had read a lot of reviews regarding this airlines. It made me nervous. But our experience was great. If you do your homework before hand you won't be surprised with a lot of extras and confusion. I would definitely fly this airline again. They were slightly late returning home (20 min). This was it unusual for any other airlines we have flown. The luggage arrived on the carousel quickly and without incident. The check in at Niagara was quick and easy. The same couldn't be said about Punta Gourda. We were there in plenty of time but soon became fearful of missing our flight. We didn't but it was close. Both check-in and security were backed up severely. The staff on the plane were great. There was a medical emergency on the plane and they handled it well and kept their cool. All in all the whole experience was every bit as good as any Air Canada flight I've been on. Only complaint would be that they charge for water. Took my own on the returning flight!
4235,We flew Cedar Rapids IA. to Mesa AZ. Flight was only 15 min. late. Seating very cramped and uncomfortable. No problems with personnel.. We had to change reservations. Went online and were given a number to call. Waited 45 min. to get to talk to anyone. No problem once we got through. We had to cancel our return trip. Again waited 45 minutes to talk to anyone. We cancelled two months before scheduled flight and was told we could only receive a voucher for another flight. The voucher was good for 12 months but they dated it from Aug. 2014 . The flight was for April 2015. This made the voucher useless to us. All in all the lower fare was not worth the hassle.
4236,TLV-FCO-JFK. One way only as we booked return with other Skyteam airline. First impression of Alitalia staff in TLV airport was already very negative. Staff rude and unprofessional. First flight from TLV to FCO uneventful. Seats comfortable with enough legroom we were seated on row 8. Connecting flight after surviving several hours in very poor FCO Rome airport departed with 1 hour delay seats are extremely hard entertainment is ok personal screen very small. Food service began very soon after take off upon which all staff disappeared until 1 hour before landing. Food decent without being interesting. Alitalia needs to improve a lot before I will consider flying them again for me they remain a second class airline.
4237,"We were overcharged for checking a 7th bag on a ticket of 5 people. Even after I explained to the ticket AA agent that the charge should only be $40, she still insisted on charging us $150. When our flight on June 25 (2971) from ORD to MLI was canceled due to mechanical issues, we were given incorrect information from multiple AA gate agents (ie. couldn't provide a rental car, couldn't rebook us on another airline, couldn't get us out of ORD until two days later), and after finally connecting with an AA representative on the phone (more than a 2 hour wait), we were told that we were indeed overcharged for our bag, and we should have been offered voucher per ticket because our flight was canceled due to mechanical issues, which caused more than a 5.5 hour delay. We were neither told this, nor were the gate agents helpful in trying to resolve the issue. We were told we couldn't file for a refund over the telephone and had to submit an email on the AA website, which I did four days ago -  still have not heard back from anyone yet."
4238,"I traveled with my wife to Paris (CDG) from Boston on June 14 on AA146. The attention was mediocre and even forgot to give my breakfast or snack.  On the return flight on June 26 from London to New York flight AA107 the service was better, like the food, plane with plenty of room for the feet and service better than normal."
4239,"Both flights to and from destination had delays. First flight was almost 2 hours delayed due to mechanical failure, we ended up boarding a new plane, then sitting on the runway for another 20 minutes. Return flight didn't have working DC outlet under seat, and GoGo flight entertainment application wouldn't work on the phone, a terrible application.  This isn't the first time I have had delays with AA (2+ hours delay due to Mechanical failure on a flight to Cancun via DFW) and if I keep on flying with them, I would assume it wouldn't be the last. Other customers were voicing the same complaints."
4240,Wont ever fly them again! Cheap is cheap you get nothing comfortable or convenient. All I can say good is we got from point A to point B. They charged us 50$ for a bag that was 46 pounds (most airlines that's within the 50# allotted). They are rude. No snacks nor pop are free even after delayed twice. Seats have no room and plane is cramped badly. Very uncomfortable flight. We sat waiting to even pull away from where we board for 40 minutes before getting out to taxi down runway. I would pay the little extra and fly a better airline any day!
4241,"This airline has an affordable price. But it needs improvements in some areas. Pros: good price non-stop extras are not built into the price you have a choice what you want to pay for (seats beverages food priority check- in baggage options). Cons: I purchased ""trip flex"". Could not change my flight online. Needed to call a rep. Waited 1/2 hr for a rep and took approx 1/2 hr. to get one leg of my trip changed. Very slow. When I got to the airport nowhere was flight info. posted. I had printed off my boarding pass and did not want to stand in line to find out what gate to go to. Had to ask a baggage person who was unsure and he found another employee and finally got my answer. Got to where I was hoping my gate was to find no agent. Other people were sitting around in confusion as well ""hoping"" they were at the right gate. Still no flight info on the screen. Had checked my flight status before leaving which posted ""on time"" and after asking other passengers (still no agent) found out that the flight was delayed 2.5 hrs. You do have a text option for alerts which I signed up for but did not receive."
4242,Flew from Rome to Toronto. Air Hostess - unfriendly. They do not respond to individual calls. You have to get up and walk to the front or to the back of the airplane if you need water. I travelled with an infant when I asked for some milk one air hostess bluntly said no. Another was good enough to accept the bottle and asked for my seat number. However most of them were grumpy and look annoyed. Entertainment - No personal entertainment No power No USB. There are TVs at the centre which play videos. Most TVs were not functioning properly some screens were in mono color. Transport to Airplane - on crowded buses. So unorganized that passengers were asked to stay inside the bus for a long time after the bus had reached the plane. I do not recommend.
4243,Travelled FCO-LHR after connecting from SOF-FCO. Transfer at FCO T3 was actually very easy (both our flights connected here). However we needed to go to the Alitalia transfer desk for boarding cards for our onward flights and found the seats we chose at time of booking had not been honoured and we were split up 10 rows apart. Not happy with this. The flight was almost 30 mins late boarding and thus departing. They made some time up but we were still about 15 mins late arriving at LHR. For a flight scheduled for just under 3 hours I did expect more than one drink and a small bag of bread snacks. I expected on a full service carrier we may at least get a sandwich. No second drink run either. After this length of flight the recaro seats did not feel at all comfortable due to the lack of padding. Leg room was ok for this length of flight.
4244,My flight from London to Chicago was in an ancient plane with no in-flight entertainment. The crew were not very friendly and the food was poor. I was told I would have to pay for spirits (on a long-haul flight!). I would avoid where possible.
4245,"It was about 82 degrees on the flight home tonight. FA's didn't seem to care about passenger comfort. Passengers were complaining about the air. Television at our seat was intermittently working. This airline needs an overhaul, sadly, just when I'm about to achieve status."
4246,"You get what you pay for, is how I feel after my second trip with American Airlines. But to be honest, was expecting a worse so I was pleasantly surprised. Flights were on time. Food and drinks were served during the flight. Wine, beer and soft drinks were served for free. Staff was polite, efficient and a few almost friendly. Plane new and clean. Water and juice or soft drinks were left available overnight to be self served. Lots of movies for entertainment. But Online check in was impossible. Especially with a connecting flight (even OneWorld one). Ground service was badly arranged at LAX. No signs or staff to seek help from. Seats in economy uncomfortable. Leg room absolutely minimum for a long-haul flight. Entertainment system worked well but selection in music was terrible. Screen didn't turn so when seats are reclined it's almost impossible to watch anything on it. Quality, taste and portion size of food was a little disappointing. At the end of the day we got where we wanted to go. On time. With no sleep but very, very cheap."
4247,We travelled to Phoenix on January 19th and returned on the 26th. We are very upset by all the extra charges. They offer cheaper rates but then add on $75 for one piece of luggage $25 for a carry-on $18 to select a seat plus all the taxes. Why don't they just make it a one fee and include everything? The airline does not offer free (or any) coffee tea or even just a glass of water. You must purchase everything else you want to drink. Where is their customer service?
4248,Travelled SOF-FCO in order to connect on to FCO-LHR. Despite the fact that Web-Check in did not work at all at the airport the check in queues moved fairly quickly. The seats I reserved at time of booking were honoured. This flight was fairly full and departed on time. We had a block time of just under 2 hours so thought we may get offered more than one drink. But not forthcoming. Not much padding on the recaro leather seats but not really a problem on a flight of this length. The cabin crew looked totally disinterested. I felt this was the bare minimum for a full service carrier.
4249,"We travel every 1-2 years internationally and often use American because of the flight availability out of Tulsa. Two years ago we flew Delta business class while we chose American business class this time - the difference was startling. Delta was great service, great seats, great food. American Airlines seats were nowhere near as comfortable, the amenity bag was a relative joke, food was acceptable but not as good. The staff were less helpful. almost every flight was late to some degree which meant having to rush to connections. They did a fairly good job in O'Hare of expediting the process. the flight out of O'Hare was one class and despite paying for business class, we received nothing."
4250,"Flight #116 departing Maui on June 22 at 8:35pm was delayed 3.5 hours. All the restaurants and stores at Maui close at 10pm. We asked the flight attendant for one bottle of water to share amongst the four of us (me, my husband, and 2 children) when boarding the flight at 12:15am and were told they have a limited amount for the flight and do not give bottles to customers. Plane had no power outlets in economy class cabin.  Even though DFW is closer to my home I will make the extra drive to Love Field and take Virgin to LAX and connect with Hawaiian on my next Hawaii trip."
4251,Flying with Allegiant used to be a great experience but not anymore. I recently went to Las Vegas from Des Moines Iowa and the plane had a problem and we had to spend 2 hours in the uncomfortable seats before takeoff. Nobody bothered to offer us water or anything. After 4 hours of being in the plane we got to the destinations. We didn't have too much luck on the way back to Des Moines I was charged 50$ for a 8 pound carry on because their site will not work properly so I couldn't add it online for 18$ fee. They're ridiculously charging for choosing the seat boarding pass carry on and water and soon for the oxygen that we're going to breathe on the plane. I'm really upset because it's such a disappointment to travel with them these days. I hope they will get better.
4252,"I chose to fly American Airlines because they offered the cheapest flight at the time I booked. I wish I would have paid the extra money to fly another airline now. While leaving Louisiana we boarded the plane twice only to be told to go back and wait in the terminal. We were not informed as to what was going on and when asked if I would make my connecting flight in Dallas I was told that I would find out when I got there. When landing in Dallas I had an hour to get to my other flight (or so I thought). We sat on the runway for over an hour, which of course we were not informed as to what was taking so long. The only thing that made the flight bearable is the fact there was movie service from the flight from Dallas to Las Vegas ($8 for a movie). I attempted to just check in online for my flight leaving tomorrow morning only to find out it told me my request could not be processed and I had to check in at the airport. I called the customer information number listed on the website only to be told it wasn't processing because I did not have a seat on my connecting flight from Dallas to Monroe. To say the least, I will never fly American Airlines again. I will spend the extra money on an airline that I trust and is less stressful to travel with."
4253,"I have never encountered less friendly cabin crew than the ones supposedly serving on our flight from Miami to London on June 19th, 2015. That lot was comparable with perhaps the Aeroflot ""of old"", whereas today you get a smile out of Aeroflot crew. American Airlines has a lot to do in this respect, if they even care. I would feel embarrassed to work for AA, it is a pity that the customers are more polite than their staff."
4254,"When I first started flying from PHX to BIL on Allegiant about four years ago I was thrilled large plane direct flight great prices. Even though I had to drive 2 hours to get to Phoenix from Tucson it was worth it. I told everyone about this great little airline. Well that great little airline seems to be suffering from growing pains. In other words they've gotten too big for their britches. They're charging prices like the big carriers (in spite of the fact that fuel prices are half of what they were a year ago) but not offering the same service. They nickel-and-dime you to death: $5 to print your boarding pass for you? $50 for an overweight bag (down to 40 lbs. allowable - it used to be 50 lbs.). Having to purchase water? Paying for seat assignment and checked and carry-on bags? What's next pay toilets on the plane? The worst part is trying to call their ""customer service"" number. I needed to change my reservation but wasn't allowed to do so using their website. While I waited on hold for 35 minutes to find out what the additional fare would be I had to listen to a recording continually telling me that I should be using their website instead. On the up side both my flights were actually on time for a change. Allegiant seems to want to charge large carrier prices without providing large carrier service (which isn't exactly anything to rave about either). If they want to sit at the grown-ups table they better learn to put their napkin in their lap instead of tucking it under their chin. Speaking of napkins I wonder when they'll start charging for those too?"
4255,"Lets start with the good. On time plane clean lucked out and had an empty seat beside me. Flight attendants perfunctory at best. The food - never in my 50 years of flying overseas once or twice a year have I experienced anything quite as bad as my recent roundtrip flights from Boston to Rome. The food was barely edible the juices were thick sugar syrup with a chemical taste floury snacks were stale. The coup de grace was something the flight attendant called a zucchini pizza? It was a 2"" thick piece of soggy white flour bread (calling it bread is being kind) with a thin layer of shredded zucchini with some type of indescribable flavoring. I took one bite out of sheer curiosity it tasted as disgusting as it looked. There is apparently no one managing their catering service. Anything seems to go! I don't expect gourmet in economy but I do expect vaguely edible. The vegetarian meals were equally bad. My suggestion should you choose to fly Alitalia bring your own food and drink."
4256,"Chicago to Manchester on Boeing 767. After an unexplained three hour delay, which kept being pushed back 15 minutes, then waiting for further updates, whilst all passengers ready and waiting at the gate, it transpired that we were waiting for cargo to be loaded at the inconvenience of fare paying passengers. Economy class has tired, hard, uncomfortable seats, limited leg room. No personal TV, just overhead TV showing (bizarrely, childrens films). Cabin staff were surly, not a smile between them. All older staff, and so rude at times. The way the breakfast boxes were thrown out was embarrassing, customer service was non-existent. No offers of second drinks, all they seemed to want to do was to get the meal service over so that they could sit down and rest. During the night time hours, it was freezing cold, even the blanket did not suffice to keep me warm. Strangely, they kept turning the lights on every now and then, so sleep was impossible. Probably the worst airline for onboard customer service I have ever encountered."
4257,Nickle and dimed! We were trying to fly from PA to FL on the cheap so we went with Allegiant. Big mistake. The base fare may seem inexpensive but they charge extra for everything (carry-on +$30 pick your seat another +$30 drinks snacks $5 etc.). The flight attendants were cranky and rude! My husband is tall and he has a bad knee so we paid $32 extra to reserve his seat in the emergency exit row (more legroom). I was led to believe that I would be seated next to him if possible. Not so. I checked-in on-line exactly 24 hours before the flight and was seated on the opposite end of the plane. Just before take-off we noticed that the seat next to him was empty. I politely asked the flight attendant if I could sit next to my husband and she rudely barked that I could not sit there as it was an exit row and I hadn't paid an extra $30 to sit there. I quietly returned to my assigned seat. If you're thinking of flying with this airline just be sure to calculate what you're actually spending (after baggage fees picking seat fees printing boarding passes fees getting a drink of water mid-flight fees etc.) and be sure to factor in dismal customer service as well.
4258,"Got evicted from my seat for being ""too attached to my grandchildren"". My husband and I took our family - 9 adults 4 children 2 infants-to Hawaii. We paid extra for the better seats for all of us and also for two exit row seats for my husband and myself. We were very pleased with the seats and the legroom for the price we paid. However While waiting an hour on the tarmac for the plane to take off I and many of the other passengers used that time to get up and stretch our legs. I talked to my family and helped entertain the grandkids. Upon returning to my seat the flight attendant told me that I had lost my chance to be in the exit row because I was ""too attached to my grandchildren"". I was incredulous but she was very firm. I had to switch seats with my son for the entire flight to Hawaii. So beware - if you are in the exit row - don't act like you like children."
4259,"The seats were uncomfortable, service was a straight menu with just 3 types of drinks (coca-cola, water, and orange juice). The seats did not have a screen, and the general screen failed and no one can listen when the safety video was played. The crew did not give us something to drink, and no headphones."
4260,"A window seat was paid for, confirmed, and I had paperwork proving this, but when checking me in American Airlines randomly changed my seat. When I questioned the service representative at terminal D5 her response was, ""well I don't have a window seat to change it to sorry."" I will never fly AA again. Terrible customer service, very disorganized and rude."
4261,"Throughout my recent trip, there were difficulties due to under-staffing at the terminals and ticket check-in, leading to several long delays. Several of us missed our first flight out of Gainesville since there was miscommunication leading to no one being at the check-out counter prior to our departure and none of the boarding pass kiosks working. The return flights were equally difficult, with only 1 kiosk working and only one person working the ticket counter, which lead to check-in requiring about an hour. Several of the initial flights were delayed, leading to several of us missing our connection. While this is understandable and does occur at times, it took approximately 2 hours to receive our hotel vouchers even though the flight arrangements were made prior. This was again due to being under-staffed as only 1 person was working this terminal. The following day, multiple flights were cancelled due to ""mechanical difficulties"" leading several of us to again miss our flights. This again lead to an almost 2 hour wait in order to re-book after already waiting an hour prior to the flight being cancelled, causing many of us to miss our chance at making a compatible connection flight. I was initially told I would again have to stay over-night and was not given further options. After calling customer service myself, I found a flight to an airport 2.5 hours away although I was required to pay the rental car fee to drive back home. In summary, due to consistent under-staffing, there were numerous long waits which ultimately delayed travel planned. This combined with several flight delays (due to mechanical difficulties - not weather), lead do my initial flight leaving a day late and my return flight being delayed 2 additional days. I travel fairly regularly, and have never ran across this issue previously. I will avoid using American Airlines in the future if possible."
4262,I have flown from South Bend Indiana to and from Punta Gorda Florida several times on Allegiant each time I ask myself why? Well after today no more. They had 4 flights scheduled from Punta Gorda this morning but only 3 ticket agents on hand. As a result we waited in line for 1.5 hours to get on the plane only to be told by the boarding stewardess to hurry as they wanted to leave on time and that we should have got there earlier. Flight crew was crabby and bossy service in general poor. Back to Southwest for me!
4263,I fly a lot and when I heard Allegiant was coming to Indianapolis I was very excited. That changed quickly. Be prepared for the following fees on top of the airfare: Between $15-$30 to choose your seat. That's each way not round trip. If you are flying with a family there is an extra $100 easy. $15 each way for a carry on bag. You can only bring a lap top bag for free. $15 to use a credit card when checking out. $50 for a checked bag. Online booking fee. $5 to print boarding pass if you do at the airport. All in all it was about $60 cheaper than Southwest for me to get to Tampa from IND. If they just rolled all those fees into the total price I would be happy. But they make you first decline a hotel rental car attractions trip protection. Then you have to go page by page with the fees. By the time I got hit with a $15 credit card fee I was exhausted. Also no place to put your Known Traveler Number. Be ready to wait on hold for over 30min for that. I'm afraid if I do it at the airport they will charge me another $10!
4264,On the flight from JFK to Rome the inflight entertainment didn't work (staff didn't seem that interested in doing anything about it) the food was the worst airline food I have had in years and the seats were very uncomfortable. The next flight from Rome to Tel Aviv was equally as bad and involved the most disorganized boarding process with people boarding from both ends of the plane with no rhyme or reason. On all of the flights the staff seemed generally disinterested.
4265,"First, the good. The customer service was friendly and engaging. They checked my bag for free because of my military service and put my girlfriend's bad under my name too. Good deal. Well, that's about all. I accidentally went to the wrong airlines line for me and my girlfriend to check our bags so we were running a little behind. That was my bad. Now, the bad for them. The flight was canceled. The delay was exceptional. Before I even knew that, there were two workers behind the counter and both were tied up. One had a problem with an international traveler couple. Second, a family had their flight canceled or rescheduled. American was attempting to help but the mother refused the offer of a taxi because she requested a carseat (which is understandable). Things slowed to a crawl at this point. Now we resume to a positive note. Did I mention the staff was friendly earlier? Yes, they were nice. Disclaimer: I reviewed this prior to boarding."
4266,"Poor customer service after the returning flight was delayed. It took 48 hours, another delayed plane, a trip to Miami, then Charlotte, then Detroit! To get from Tampa Florida to Louisville Kentucky. You can drive it in 10. No one in customer service in Miami spoke understandable English. Not one person! And all I get from American Airline is ""We know you are disappointed"" and ""We are confident we can do a great deal better""."
4267,Flew out of Grand Island Nebraska January 8 2014. I understand there are policies for the size and weight of carryon luggage (which mine met). Observing the interaction of the agent with the customers checking in I found her to be rude unprofessional and lecturing. She didn't bother to listen to customers or attempt to help customers. At least she was consistent in her poor behavior toward all customers therefore I conclude this is either a training or management issue.
4268,I went from Provo to LA. I was stuck at the airport with 3 kids for 13 hours while Allegiant kept delaying our flight. Finally after flying home and being unable to land we flew to Las Vegas. It took another hour and 3 lines later to get a room. I could have drove home and to Disneyland twice in the time it took to fly with them. Actually I would have drove home if they would have been honest at first rather than keep delaying. My husband and I both missed a day of work.
4269,YYZ-FCO/FLR Toronto-Rome non stop: I flew Premium Economy. There was no special line for this class of service in Toronto. There was no invitation to the Lounge the staff welcome was fine but too concerned with the 4 in Magnifica Class and the full masses in economy. There were 6 of us in P. Economy section so nice and quiet. The seat recline was fine the leg rest was useless as I'm only 5'6. This did not elevate my legs in the least. The pillow and flimsy blanket were fine. Lots of room to manoeuvre between the seat in front. The plastic glass half full welcome prosecco was chilled nicely but that was the end of the sparkling wine. The food was not advertised in the generic brochure - a surprise on board it was the same food as economy class. 500 Euros more for Magnifica if bought on board I didn't bother. The overall pilot/flight was smooth and 40 minutes early November 18 2012.
4270,"I can't believe what a dissapointment this company has became, I had a flight from NYC to Memphis, on Friday 12th, my flight was cancelled at the last minute without any explanation. I catch a early flight in the morning of the 13th, then I have my return flight from Memphis to NYC on the 14TH June. When I got to DCA my flight was delayed and as always at the last minute they cancelled my flight, they didn't even give us a hotel room., I slept at the airport thinking I would leave the airport first thing in the morning, to my surprise I didn't, they put me on another flight with US Airways which was the same, as I was waiting for my flight, they cancelled again, then they put me on an AA flight leaving at 9.47 am and now is leaving at 10."
4271,"The worst exeprience I have had. Completly disorganized routes. In 1 day 2 delayed flights, one with 4hr, second one with 2hr delay. Next to that 2 changes of gates - terrible!"
4272,Flew out of Grand Island Nebraska January 8 2014. I understand there are policies for the size and weight of carry-on luggage (which mine met). I observed the interaction of the agent with the customers checking in. She was rude unprofessional and lecturing. She didn't bother to listen to customers or attempt to help customers. At least she was consistent in her poor behavior toward all customers therefore I conclude this is either a training or management issue.
4273,LEX to PIE. PIE to CVG. First time with Allegiant and last. Seats are plastic with minimal padding I don't mind the non-reclining but 2-3 hours on a plastic kitchen chair is uncomfortable at best realistically it was painful. Five flights leaving PIE on the 3rd of Jan all delayed at least an hour. Five flights of people in a four gate terminal. There weren't enough seats the snack bar ran out of food and TSA was a joke. Check-in was a circus with the clerks culling certain flights to check in first. Not because of time they just chose to do it. Sorry Allegiant you're not an economy airline just a bad one.
4274,Flew from Luxembourg to Rio and back to London in January. Long-haul flights were on Alitalia's brand new A330 which is a very nice plane. Sadly the overall experience wasn't great - the staff looked bored and disappeared for most of the flight the food was pretty disgusting (and I'm not a fussy eater) the in-flight entertainment system was very sticky (cue people hitting the screen behind your head for half the flight) and the selection of films was poor. The flights were ridiculously cheap so perhaps you get what you pay for in which case maybe this review should be an overall 9.
4275,"First overseas trip in the newly configured B767 with flat beds. The cabin looks very crisp, clean, and modern but I found the seats to be uncomfortable and poorly designed. The seats seem very narrow, and once in the flat bed position your feet end up in a narrow, confining box-like area which makes it difficult to move around. Impacted sleep quality immensely. Tablet-based IFE strange, clunky with limited choices. The biggest positive surprise was the food, which was as good an airline meal as I've had. Perfectly roasted duck breast in a coconut lime curry was restaurant quality, salads fresh and crisp. On balance better than expected and an improvement for AA."
4276,"AA has completely lost my trust. The woman at the check in counter knew nothing about free bags for military civilians. After paying for our bag, she gave us our boarding pass and mentioned nothing about it being delayed. We found out after I noticed that the time was different on our boarding pass. When the time came to board, we find out that the flight is cancelled when we noticed no plane at our gate. We approached some AA attendants and the woman apologized for forgetting to announce it, and then looked for another flight for us. She found one for a 5am flight - 4.30am check in and gave us a hotel voucher of which the shuttle runs every half hour. That means we would have to leave the hotel at 3am in order to make the flight. At 2.30am, my boyfriend finds out through the flight tracker to discover it is cancelled again! He tries to call customer service to reschedule but had a 1 hour wait time on the phone. When he finally gets through, the man on the phone suggested a flight at JFK at 7am, which we wouldn't be able to make it in time even if we left at that moment (3.40) because we would have to wait for the (every 30 min) shuttle, get on the airport train, get to the stop for long term parking, then get the bus to get us to our car, and then drive over an hour to JFK. So then he puts us on a 3.50 flight to Chicago getting us there at nearly 6pm. Our whole Saturday is gone. AA wasted us a lot of money and time. I will never fly with them again."
4277,"What has happened? Airlines have revolved into greedy money making machines and in turn allowed people to become smug and uncaring for others. What used to happen in my day when a person of 6ft 5ins boarded a plane there was consideration and care? Now it is all about extra money! I distinctly remember when this situation arose we would kindly ask smaller exit seated passengers to swap and 9 times out of ten people would be happy to do so. We maybe would offer a few drinks in return and everyone was happy. My son who is 6ft 5in was like a caged animal on our recent American Airlines flight, 10 hours of absolute hell. Yes we could have paid more for an exit seat but he is a student and this was not an option. While shorter passengers get seats for less he is now faced with either having to pay more to travel than shorter people or not travel at all. It is not as if he can do anything about his height, if he was simply overweight ??then he could diet ??but this is not the case. American Airlines allowed him to stand up all the way from LA to LHR for 10 hours, when he had to sit his legs had to be wide apart and any chance of a brace position would be completely ruled out. American Airlines ??shame on you for your greed! I am not sure why trolleys were used for the meal service ??they could have just chucked boxes of junk down the cabin and asked those interested to catch them."
4278,Flew GRR to Sanford/Orlando Jan 3. Flight was over 3 hours late. Of the last 3 flights on this route all three were over 3 hours late. Very poor! I think they may need new management. Airline used to be quite good and on time. Other passengers gave us the same story on their flights in recent years. Next time we'll go Southwest from MCO.
4279,Greece to Toronto Ontario. Flight was ok but the service and my seating arrangements were absolutely horrible. I flew with my 2 daughters one who is 9 months old and even when I arranged for a bassinet for the baby I had my daughter for 11 hrs on my lap because apparently Alitalia only carries 2 Bassinets on the flight. After all this they lost my luggage when I arrived and it took 5 days for me to retrieve it. My first and last time I fly with them.
4280,Flew VRN-FCO-MIA and back in Alitalia economy on a reward ticket. All flights more or less on time. Crew on domestic flights almost courteous crew on international flights presumptuous and on the brink of being outright brazen. On top of that they did not see any need to keep the airplane reasonably clean. The restrooms looked on both intercontinental trips like the restrooms of a run down railway station. If you have an alternative avoid Alitalia.
4281,"I flew non-stop from SLC to MIA on a redeye, 4 hours of flight time, no problems, delighted to find a non-stop flight. A week later, coming home, (June 10 2015) was a totally different experience.  The flight to DFW was delayed for a mechanical problem (air speed indicator), so they re-boarded us on a different plane, but after all
passengers were seated and the safety video shown, they said there was another mechanical problem (didn't identify it) and sent all 200 of us to a re-booking desk which couldn't possibly accommodate all of us.  Meanwhile after an hour standing in line, they called us back to the second airplane and the ones of us who hadn't left in search of another flight, toted rolling bags etc on board yet a third time and we sat and continued to wait while the baggage was loaded. This leg of the trip had begun with the supposed 12.25 pm departure of Flight 2407, but by now it was 5.30 pm, with no signs of hope. I knew I'd already missed my connecting flight to SLC, and was able to book another DFW flight for 6 pm.  I made it in time to board this different flight, but the 6.00 departure time turned out to be 7.00pm.  The delay here was for yet another unexplained reason.  Still,  I was able at DFW to make my connecting flight to SLC on a 10.00 flight, but this interminable day stretched out far longer than it should have, and I don't see how it could be, that every single AA flight I was on that day, all had delays. The staff were friendly and helpful, but, I can't recommend this airline."
4282,"A friend and I flew JFK-BOS-MIA-CUR last minute and at an incredibly low cost. BOS-MIA we got 'upgraded' to Main Cabin Extra for no apparent reason. Check in was actually surprisingly smooth and efficient, friendly staff. Out of the 12 Cabin Crew on the 3 legs 9 didn't spare a smile, didn't manage to finish the 'service' (consisting of 1 complimentary drink) and seemed to be tired and/or just hated their job. 2 were plain rude to fellow passengers for no apparent reason as well as unprofessional and only 1 of the 12 was outstandingly nice and cheery as well as professional. Aircraft old but decent enough, no entertainment (one leg not even safety demonstration after all screens didn't work). On ground experience and price top, inflight flop."
4283,"This is the 3rd time this year that I have flown with American Airline, I give this airline 1 star out of 5 stars. Number 1 reason is this airline has constant delays all across the board, every flight I have flown on has been late or delayed for the past 3 times this year. I will never fly with this airline again. I am extremely dissatisfied with the quality of service and the delays they have for every flight."
4284,I use Allegiant because they fly to some smaller airports at very competitive rates (Sanford Roanoke). On Christmas eve last week I boarded the 1st plane for an hour before a maintenance issue came up and we deboarded. 2 hours later we board a second plane which flew for about an hour before returning to Sanford. This is probably because Allegiant flies the oldest fleet in the country. We were told another plane would be there by midnight (13.5 hours in Sanford airport). So I missed Christmas with my family. But they did give us $8 for food all day which doesn't cover the cost of the cheapest burger available and a $100 voucher which I had to call twice to use. I guess this is what comes with being the lowest cost ticket.
4285,"My flight from MOT to LAS (447) scheduled for 1/2/15 for 6.20pm. After 3 delays we got word that our plane had finally arrived. Instead of pulling into the airport terminal it went to the Fedex hanger. Of coarse they had to have the crew go pull them out by the time they offloaded the crew had reached it's ""time"" for the day but if they hadn't been delayed 3 times and then parked at a Fedex building instead of the terminal then they wouldn't have run out of ""time"". So 5 hours waiting at the airport were a waste and instead of just cancelling the flight right away we were not honestly communicated with. We were informed that night that the flight would be 9.30 am. After arriving to the airport I get a call and email saying the flight had been rescheduled for 1.15. So after I return again to the airport the flight is delayed but this time no warning or communication. Just time to board comes and goes. An update came at 2.30 that they were having troubles with the plane and that they would have it fixed momentarily and be on there way. At 4 they told us they were all clear that once the flight crew gave the go ahead then we would begin boarding. At 6.30pm they told us the plane wasn't going to be able to fly. They then told us that in 2 hours a new plane would be coming from Fargo to pick us up. So it is now 7.39 and I have been here in the terminal with no food or drink waiting for some honesty and communication from Allegiant. I can deal with being caged I have a pc tablet cell phone and book. The worst part is the elderly and small children."
4286,YYZ-FCO-IST. We flew with Boeing 777-200 from Toronto to Rome. We had a delay of half an hour. The airplane was decent. The cabin crew were not friendly. I ordered vegetarian meal and it was awful. I have flown this route before and the meal was the same for both flights. They never change the menu! The personal entertainment system was terrible. It had very limited variety of songs and movies. Also it did not work for about 2 hours. The snack was good and it was prepared specially for vegetarians. The seats were okay. When we landed to FCO the ground crew were rude and raised their voice to us just because we stopped for a minute to take out our boarding passes. From Rome to Istanbul the seats were uncomfortable. We had a delay of half an hour. The snack was good but it was very small. Overall I will totally not recommend this route because of the delays and the little leg-room.
4287,"Just returned from a trip to the Caymans for a wedding, and as usual had a bad experience on American.  I had hoped that the pending merger would improve Americans quality, but instead I'm afraid it will make USAir worse.  I used miles and flew business class on USAir - cost 120,000!  The plane was actually an American plane, and was dirty, with torn, worn out, uncomfortable seats. Service was marginal.  I keep having bad experiences on American, and have actually decided to use up my miles and change to another carrier - it is sad to see how airline travel has degraded - dirty, worn out, cramped, buses with wings."
4288,I travelled to and back from LGA. Going was actually with US Airways. The staff on both journeys were rude although the LGA to LHR flights were better. Going to LGA staff were rude and not helpful when serving food. The entertainment system was okay although have seen better the touch screens do not work properly. I was sat at the front so luckily had good space however the other seats seemed tight. The second part of the flight (domestic one) was a two by two carrier and the tiniest aircraft I had seen. I would not recommend and I would avoid at all costs.
4289,My husband and I flew to London in business class on 4/29/2015. Plane was old business class seats were too close to each other the food was the worst ever. Toilets were dirty. We will never fly American Airlines business class anymore. Very unsatisfied customers. We usually fly Qantas business to the U.S. from Australia and let me tell you that it is a first class airline! I'm flying back to London on July 9 business class flying with BA never again AA. Very dissatisfied customers.
4290,I've flown Allegiant many times and always from Bellingham to Palm Springs Palm Springs-Bellingham. The only reason we take Allegiant is because we live near Bellingham and Palm Springs and they have direct flights. The seats don't recline and couldn't be much closer and they charge extra for everything. But today on the flight from KBLI to KPSP was really miserable the plane left an hour late but worse because the floor and my feet were freezing the entire time we sat on the tarmac and during the entire 2.5 hour flight. I would definitely bring winter gear next time I fly Allegiant in the winter. I have never experienced such a cold aircraft floor on any flight in over 30 years of flying on a dozen different airlines.
4291,MIA-FCO (seat 4L) and FCO-MIA (seat 4A) in late Nov 2012. Seat was very comfortable liked the way the table works and the large video screens are nice. I had a window seat and it had very good privacy. I thought the seat could have been a little longer for sleeping but it was comfortable enough. The centre section seats do not have air vents though those on the window sides of aisles (both the aisle and window) do have air vents. Video (movies etc.) were OK. The seat in general was the best I've been in out of Delta Air France KLM and Continental/United. However I'd have to say the service especially on the FCO-MIA leg left a good bit to be desired. Food wasn't properly heated on either leg though was good. On FCO-MIA (all daylight flight) the crew did a lunch service and then disappeared until they served the pre-landing meal. Other than the actual meal service they disappeared. This crew had some ice and a few drinks they put out self-service but then never showed up again. This aircraft actually has the seats split into two business sections - the forward section where most Magnifica seats are located (Rows 1-5) and then small section behind the doors with rows 6-7. Upon arrival in MIA my checked bag did not appear up on the carousel. I had a connection to make but needed to pick up clear customs and recheck my bag but that's hard to do with no bag. An agent got me through customs and sent me on to my flight all the while assuring me that my bag would make it. After boarding my Delta connecting flight the Delta agent came onboard to my seat and gave the me the bag check slip and my bag did indeed make the connecting flight.
4292,I was on a return flight from Rome to Istanbul. I had booked a ticket on the website with an approximate 1% discount for EU citizens 25 or under for which I am a British EU citizen who was 25 at the time. On my flight to Istanbul I had to wait for quite a while at the counter to get my boarding pass. I do not speak Italian and the staff spoke among themselves in Italian for a long while without telling me what the problem was in fact not admitting there was a problem. There wasn't a big line so this didn't delay other passengers. Eventually they issued me my boarding pass. Ok a bit of a pain but not such a big deal. The flight was without incident. On my return flight Istanbul to Rome I got to the counter to collect my boarding pass and there was another holdup. The staff spoke amongst themselves for much longer than the first flight approximately 30-45 minutes. Again they wouldn't admit there was a problem and I asked several times what the supposedly non existent problem was with no luck. Again they spoke in their own language to each other and on the phone so I couldn't eavesdrop. They also made several phone calls. I was getting pretty anxious because I thought there was a serious problem. As there were only a small number of counters in operation for Alitalia in Istanbul at the time the line ballooned out as a result of the holdup and I wonder if some passengers missed their flights. Eventually the counter staff asked me if I was a student. I said no. They then told me to go and buy a new ticket without explaining why. When I pried them they told me it was because I had purchased a discount ticket without the right to do so. I then explained to them that Alitalia had offered an approximate 1% discount on their website for EU citizens 25 and under and the discount had nothing to do with being a student. The lady at the counter then made another call then issued me my boarding pass without apologising. I am not sure if it was the same problem on the outbound flight but It does seem rather odd that the staff appeared not aware of their own policy regarding the 25 and under discount for EU citizens (maybe the policy changed?) which is quite a common discount that many companies and organisations offer in the EU. Also if they had have admitted what the problem was from the beginning I could have resolved the whole thing right away. It also appeared to me to be a poor use of judgement to hold up the line for such a considerable amount of time over the question of a discount of approximately 1 euro. This upset me greatly. Otherwise the flight itself was without incident.
4293,May 14th AA63. May 21st AA62. Paris-Miami Economy: the worst experience I have had for a long distance flight. I was lucky to get the seats with more space without paying as I was one of the last ones to check in. The airplane was so old that it is difficult to put a small bag inside the plane. What's more shocking is not having an individual screen for each passenger. moreover on the Paris-Miami flight the steward was not nice at all. While the hostess gave me a can of coke he only gave me a glass. The food was ok but very low quality compared to the price paid. On the return flight the food was just terrible no comment I did not eat it. Of course same thing on the return flight no screens and very old plane. The seat in front of me was all torn. I have tried many other airlines for long distance flights being in Europe or Asia and none of them were as bad as this one.
4294,Our trip was from Ft. Wayne IN to Tampa Fl. Allegiant made us believe that we would be flying into the Tampa International Airport we actually flew into the Clearwater/St. Pete Airport. We made arrangements to rent a car at the airport but because the car was not at the airport we landed we had to pay ($35) for transportation to the Tampa International Airport to get to the car. On the return home we had to return the car to Tampa International Airport and pay ($40) for transportation to get to the Clearwater/St Pete Airport to our flight home. The people at the car rental office says this happens all the time because of Allegiant Air's miscommunication! We got a great deal on our airline tickets but we had to spend so much extra on the car that we'll certainly think twice before using Allegiant Air again!
4295,We flew recently in Magnifica (business) to Caracas (July 16th and August 27th 2012) and in Classica Plus (premium economy) to New York (November 4th and 19th). Not a terrible experience but sorry to say that our national airline is poor in terms of comfort service and quality of food. In Magnifica the service is not adequate at all (why are the flight attendants with some exceptions so rude?) and the food is very far from the Italian excellent international reputation. In Classica Plus we experienced seats not much more comfortable than in Economy very poor food light and headphones malfunctions. Extremely sad.
4296,"Flew with my wife from Seattle to Charleston with stops in DFW and DCA. Selected the least expensive flights and we are not frequent travelers so I did not expect a great experience. Our flights did get rescheduled probably due to the merger with US Airways. Delays were manageable with just one hour on the first leg out of Seattle. What I did not expect was for the flight attendants to be so curt and rude. When I was denied a blanket I could almost read the attendants mind (""please put me out of my misery""). Impolite doesn't even begin to describe their attitude."
4297,"A very frustrating experience. First their flight is delayed due to ""bad weather"" in LGA whereas we can see that United and all other airlines are taking off and the weather looked good enough. Initially they said it is delayed by an hour so we thought fine lets wait for an hour then they tell its delayed by another 2 hours. We had to catch a connecting flight at ORD which had just an hour layover. Then finally this flight from LGA is scheduled to take off 6 hours later than actual scheduled timings which means the connecting flight has already left. I called the customer care to check for the status and they tell that there are no more connecting flights from ORD to XNA for the day. The next connecting flight was only at 9.15am from ORD. So we decided to wait until 6.30am that day and leave directly from LGA instead of going to ORD and waiting till 9.15am. We (including my aged mother) finally landed up sleeping in the airport all night. The TSA officials were kind enough to give all passengers sleeping in the airport a cot and a bed sheet. Next day morning we start at 6.15AM and then again the flight is delayed by 2 hrs. One of the passengers asked the flight attendant if she will get her connecting flight and the attendant replies ""We just have to keep hopes. That is all we can do""!"
4298,I flew from IAH Airport to DFW as a layover and then DFW to ORD as the final destination on Saturday May 23rd. The flight leaving IAH was on time and arrived on time to DFW. However the flight from DFW was delayed by 45 minutes because the plane was coming in from Montego Bay Jamaica. So we had to wait and it took an additional hour to arrive at final destination.
4299,Booked several weeks in advance for a trip from Minot ND to Las Vegas. We paid for advanced seat selection and a checked luggage item at the time of booking. The Allegiant website and online check-in app were incredibly easy and intuitive. I did have difficulty getting the boarding pass to load with the app at first but a couple of tries later it worked. The check in agent in Minot wore a Frontier Airlines uniform and generally was kind of ignorant. The Minot terminal was very cold. The flight was delayed briefly for an issue with an inbound passenger but eventually left about 20 minutes late. Flight was uneventful and went by quickly. I found the MD-83 to be actually quite comfortable even though the seats didn't recline. There was no inflight entertainment system but the onboard magazine was decent and even contained Vegas coupons! We arrived only a little late. The crew was efficient and friendly and even cracked a couple jokes over the PA on arrival and bags dispensed quickly. On the return flight check-in and boarding were pleasant and quick and we left on time. The airplane however was absolutely filthy! The seats were worn the tray tables were slopped all over and even the window had food on it. We had the same crew situation as outbound in that they were efficient friendly and helpful. On arrival to Minot we were early but luggage took 30 minutes to dispense. In the end yes this airline is acceptable. They're certainly inexpensive and the crews are on par with most other carriers. If you want to save up to a few hundred dollars I'm sure you can put up with buying your soda onboard.
4300,Toronto to Rome and back again. Couldn't get proper seat assignments due to inconsistent information at booking and then at check in. Spent in total 18+ hours in cramped miserable seats. Check in staff in Rome were extremely rude. There are no words for how bad the food was - they would be better off telling passengers to buy food at the airport prior to boarding because it was horrible. Boarding is basically a free for all with no queuing or filling the plane from rear to front - so it ends up with people racing for overhead bins. No assistance for families or elderly passengers. Basically they got us to Italy and back. But it was just an awful experience all around.
4301,I flew from NY to Rome. It was a long flight with a rude flight crew poor quality food and a dirty plane. It was a mad house from the ticket counter to the boarding gate. A real lack of organization and even less concern for their customers. Plane arrived on time but the 9 hour + trip was not enjoyable given the conditions.
4302,Flew May 9 2015 from Boston to Paris. I am 75 yrs old and having lived both in South Africa and Europe have done a considerable amount of flying. This flight was absolutely the worst ever. Conditions regarding space and comfort (lack thereof) were beyond appalling. People who could not fit their feet under the seat in front of them were forced to stick them into the aisle. I feel that safety is compromised by these conditions and both the US Transportation Department and American Airlines need to seriously consider this issue. I will of course never fly with this airline again. In addition the food was not fit for consumption.
4303,I flew from Orlando to Barcelona on May 6th with a return on May 18th. It was by far one of my worst experiences in commercial flying. The reasoning for this rating is extensive and ranges from their computer changing my times and seats three times from reservation to flight to inoperative bathroom in flight to massive delays both ways ranging from almost 2 hours to cool down an aircraft cabin before boarding to waiting over 2 hours for flight attendants to arrive in Miami from Philadelphia. It is obvious that no longer is the passenger important but rather all the extra charges and cramped seating that rule the day. In terms of choosing an airline carrier it is sadly my opinion that airlines such as KLM or Lufthansa offer better service and would be my first choices on international flights.
4304,ORD-SAT on Apr 9 and RNO-ORD on Apr 23 both legs in First (due to upgrade) on an MD80. Both flights fine with slightly early arrivals and no drama - Obviously older planes showing some wear and tear but comfortable with standard First class seats. FA tending to First Class on the ORD-SAT leg was excellent hard working attentive continuously present in the cabin to tend to the passengers also a bit more formal (in a good way) less chatty (again good) and obviously concentrating on delivering a good service. FA on the second leg more relaxed in delivering service but still ok. Catering for the first (evening) leg was a chicken or pasta choice with the chicken dish bland and just barely edible. Not good enough even for economy on many other airlines. Also strange that AA considers the chicken or pasta choice a First Class offering on a three hour dinner time flight probably only possible on the US market. Wines served were ok and regular refills offered by the good FA. First Class breakfast RNO-ORD leg was cereal with no other option. Again how this can be considered a First Class breakfast for a four hour flight is beyond me. Good premium check-in with no significant lines and manned counters in both ORD and RNO boarding professional and painless. Actually two pleasant flights with good crews but also with sub- par catering. Also of course excellent value due to the upgrade.
4305,Flight 55 to Chicago due out Sunday morning at 9.30. Sat in airport all day to find out at around 3pm that the flight had been cancelled due to a technical issue. No information from the staff all day. Had to find out what was going on via the website. The flight got rescheduled for Monday. After another hour delay we finally boarded the same aircraft that they where having issues with the previous day. We set off to the runway only to turn back with a technical issue. We were then sat onboard the aircraft for a further 6 hours as they where having the same issues as the previous day. After the 6 hours we where informed that the flight was being cancelled yet again. By this time it was to late to make alternative arrangements. The downfall for me was the job I should have been at on Monday morning had to be cancelled as I could only get there by Wednesday. Total disgrace.
4306,Flight 105 on Nov 10th from Peoria to Phoenix/Mesa. I was recently on a flight from Peoria IL. to Mesa AZ. The fasten seat belt sign was on for over two hours even though the flight was mostly smooth and little turbulence. An elderly gentleman got up to use the restroom and was told to return to his seat. The flight attendant was very rude with a control complex. I have never been on a flight where people were not allowed to get up and use the restroom.
4307,LAX-FCO-PMO. FCO-LAX. All flights left thirty or more minutes late but we didn't miss any connections. The food was good and flight attendants were generally friendly. We liked the bottomless wine and self-service snacks. Check-in process in Rome was bad waited in line for almost 90 minutes to check in which was frustrating. At the gate no organization at all. They just open the gate and it's a cattle call to squeeze onto the plane. Experience was better that expected.
4308,BOS-FCO FCO-BOS - Outbound we were assigned vegetarian meals (whether through our error or theirs I can't say). I didn't eat the dinner but for breakfast we were served a single rice cake and a few pieces of cut fruit! On the return flight they messed up our seat reservations (made 5 months in advance) not once but twice for the same flight. The crew's passenger list showed no seat assignments for us so we got two middle seats next to the loos. On both trips the planes were dirty. The carpets were filthy. The loos looked clapped- out with bits of paper stuck around the walls. Do they ever clean these planes? Pros: The crew were polite.
4309,YYZ-FCO 09/09/2012. Pros: great flight crew. Strangely it was an all-boys crew however they did their best to accommodate passengers??needs. Level of attentiveness was very good and they were ready to smile and to answer any question. Pros: thinking AZ was a Star Alliance member I would have expected better standards. B763 was truly worn out even if it sported Star Alliance??s logo. No PTV (almost acceptable) but the monitor close to my seat was shut off. The trim of the overhead bins across from my aisle was missing leaving a ?œraw??piece of airplane in plain sight. Throughout the night when the cabin lights were shut off the reading lights of my row were going off at once giving a sort of flashing / disco effect to the cabin. Although it was 09/09 the in-flight magazines were the ones of the previous month. The light brown economy seat I was in showed large dark spots although it felt slightly wider than regular economy seats and (a little bit) softer.
4310,I had a flight from Chicago to London Heathrow. Flight 46 on 14th May. A Boeing 767-300. Delayed by 2 hours so missed my British Airways connection. Cabin was dull. Worst part no personal screen and seats short on legroom. Felt like all economy passengers were refugees running to some other place. Food was ok but not as good as compared to Air India. Staff were ok too. Will never recommend AA.
4311,After a 24 hour delay during which time we were not kept informed of what was happening we board another plane. The new plane sits on the tarmac 45 minutes past take off time and only then the pilot informs us there appears to be a problem with the plane so the plane returns to the gate. There are no apologies there is no information and it seems total indifference to people like myself who will miss their connection resulting in a further 8 hour delay. Service is zero professionalism is zero however the aircrew do appear to be putting in a lot of effort to avoid passing among the passengers or making eye contact. Flight 9268 to Chicago.
4312,I flew Baltimore to Seoul (BWI-DFW-ICN) on 10 May 2015 the flight out of Baltimore had to return to the gate due a cockpit display not working making the flight an hour late on take off. We were then diverted due to weather - admittedly the crew were helpful during our enforced 4 hour plane-bound ground stop in Austin. We finally got to Dallas 5 hours late ???˜to be greeted by a (non-existent) customer representative??the queue for the customer service at C25 was pathetic ??two people and a queue of several hundred snaking around the terminal. Fortunately I had my BA executive card and got into the Admirals lounge were the queue was only about 20 people. We (three of us) were rebooked on the flight to Narita (Japan) and onto Seoul the following day. Although technically that flight would have left technical ?˜issues??meant that we left 7.5 hours late arriving in Narita at about 11pm. What a contrast - upon arrival there were about 15 Japanese customer service people with individual ?˜packages??for passengers containing onward boarding passes details of buses to pre-arranged hotel accommodation and a food box. Next day a special bus took us back to the airport for our onward flight to Seoul. Our luggage was not so lucky ??even with the 7 hour delay at Dallas AA was unable to send our luggage out for another 2 days! The return flight was ?˜better????in that there wasn't a delay but the flight was cramped ??the 777 clearly had not been ?˜spring cleaned??since its delivery many many years ago the food was mediocre at best and the ?˜entertainment system??simply because it was entertaining trying to find anything of interest to watch/listen to. Quite simply AA (as do other US carriers) provided the absolute bare minimum. Unfortunately it is ?˜company policy??to only fly American carriers ??and probably the only reason that American carriers still exist.
4313,We flew to Rome from Toronto. The seats were very uncomfortable. The television monitors were the old style down the centre and far apart and showing a movie with English subtitles. Our return flight was no better I'd say it was worse. The boarding was a free for all no help for seniors or folks with little ones. They started to load from the front then opened the back doors so you had folks trying to squeeze past each other in the aisles with luggage while others were stowing belongings - it was chaos. Our seats were dirty stained and torn fabric pockets were ripped. The meal - dried out and cold pasta that they called a lasagne. Needless to say never again.
4314,Flight 2256 to depart IAH at 6pm on 5/12/15 was delayed by one hour. Myself and 2 daughters were on our way to Branson MO for a short vacation with family. This delay made it impossible to connect to our flight at DFW so we had to reschedule our flights to the next day cutting into our planned time with family. I have not flown AA in years due to lost luggage issues previously and this is my experience the first time I tried to use them again. Not only was this a huge hassle with 2 kids to get to and thru the airport (then out again and back the next day) but I'm very disappointed in the fact that our vacation is having to be cut into as a result of the flight delay. Extremely disappointed.
4315,AA138 DFW-DCA first class. I've really stopped expecting anything when flying domestically in the US or Canada. Flight departed late due to heavy traffic and weather. Seat ok but nothing special on a 737-800. Was in 1A. Having just got off QR from Doha a big change. Cabin crew not friendly Basically had my meal tossed at me. Meal itself was tasteless and over cooked. No control over economy class passengers using first class lavatory even while the seatbelt sign was on. It is getting me home which is about all I can say that is positive about this flight.
4316,It is not a good feeling when you get ashamed of the company that is representing your country to the world. But it was how I felt when I boarded AA 91 from London to Chicago. The oldest plane ever out of 4 overhead TV (they didn't even fold-this ancient) 2 didn't work. How can you still not have an in seat entertainment on an 8 hours international flight? Noise level in the cabin was at times unbearable. It was the last leg of our round-trip to Greece. First 3 legs were served by British Airways - what a dramatic difference.
4317,10/25/14 flight 581 from Bellingham to Las Vegas and on 10/26/14 flight 580 from Las Vegas to Bellingham. The trip down on flight 581 was severely delayed. Taxied down the runway only to have to come back to the gate when a warning light on the navigation system came on just before take off. At the gate 20+ minutes later they thought they had it all sorted out and were wrapping up paperwork went to push back from the gate and the light came on again. Thankfully after a few more minutes they let us off the plane and kept us in the terminal. Flight eventually was given permission to travel without the navigation systems but had to redirect flight path and had to fly at a lower altitude to avoid traffic. This crew was friendly and polite and the pilot kept us informed of all the things that were happening. The major downfall our flight landed almost 4 hours later than scheduled and the only compensation we received was a free $2.00 beverage. Flight 580 the next day was better in some ways worse in others. Again taxied down the runway and were next to take off when a warning light came on. We sat on the runway for about 30 minutes waiting for the issue to be fixed. Sadly the crew was very rude both in person and on the intercom barking orders and coming dangerously close to a yelling tone with passengers. This was not my first poor trip with Allegiant but it will be the last. The low ticket price is no longer a selling feature since they gouge you on fees for everything including printing a simple boarding pass. Driving to SeaTac Airport is about the same cost when you add in all Allegiant's fees but comes with the added peace of mind when it comes to mechanical soundness and pleasant staff.
4318,We flew Toronto to Rome and on to Rimini. Our experience with Alitalia was terrible. We were delayed by 5 hours leaving Toronto which resulted in a 9 hour layover in Rome. This turned into a 12 hour layover as our flight was delayed. We were given no information about how the delay would impact our connection and were sent from desk to desk to speak with various staff who were rude and couldn't (or wouldn't help). Since we had been awake for over 30 hours without our baggage we asked staff for toiletries so that we could wash and brush our teeth. Staff were rude and unsympathetic.
4319,"Just returned from a two week trip to China using AA into Beijing returning from Shanghai. We've traveled to over 70 countries world wide and this was the first and last time we'll ever use American Airlines. They use a 777-200 out of Chicago which resembles a cattle car the way passengers are packed into the economy section. 2-5-2 configuration and while we paid extra to sit in the two side the seats were so cramped there wasn't enough room between rows to put the tray table down for meals. When the passengers in front reclined their seats it was claustrophobic. Keep in mind this is a 14 hour flight. Ironically enough the flight attendants who refer to this equipment as the Slave Ship told us AA is talking about adding another row of seats. Meals were horrid power port and audio jacks didn't work and the ""entertainment"" system is laughable. We had three flights in China on China Eastern Airlines while we were there and their aircraft were all modern clean and spacious. If this is what we can expect from the American/US Airways merger I will avoid the new company at all costs."
4320,This was the worst travelling experience! The staff are rude and abrupt at check-in the meals are terrible and you cannot purchase anything else on board they didn't have earphones or the option to purchase on board (for a long haul flight from Philadelphia to Dublin) and none of the reading lights worked in our row. Aside from this the planes are extremely old to the point where it was genuinely terrifying. The insulation is extremely thin in comparison to other planes so you can hear every noise the engine makes! Also the navigation system didn't work as we were landing but the pilot told us not to worry he knew Dublin so he could find the airport!
4321,Flight was cheap. Flew from Duluth MN to Las Vegas. The flight out was freezing and the flight back was hot. They save money by not turning anything on until you're in the air. No assistance from staff and the pilot remarked more than once that they are only on the plane for our safety. They just talked to each other the whole flight each way. Did load the App on my phone and scanned ticket so we saved money. You get what you pay for. Just be ready for it and read the fine print.
4322,Flew from Toronto to Rome and back. Boarding in Toronto was chaotic there was no process to board back of the plane first then middle then front. It was a free-for all. Staff remained at back of plane for entire flight except when serving beverages then meals. No water or snacks in between meals. The planes were old - in fact had ashtrays in the arm rests. TV's were the old fashioned shared versions. Movie on the way over was pathetic. One of two movies on way back was good. Cold air was blowing the entire time from Rome to Toronto with no way to adjust air flow. I will not fly Alitalia again.
4323,Flight from Toronto to Rome and then connecting from Rome to Milan. Our flight was late leaving Toronto by 45 minutes actually 1 hour by the time we left the runway. During the flight the crew were inattentive and somewhat rude. They appeared only when serving drinks and meals and disappeared during the remainder of the flight. Passengers had to go and get their own drinks after service was completed. Lots of spills as passengers walked from the back of the plane with their drinks. The continental breakfast was pathetic offering 2 Oreo cookies along with yoghurt and a soggy pastry inside a cellophane wrapper. When we landed there was no fast tracking provided for us at the passport control and we had only half an hour to get through before our connecting flight. It was no surprise that we missed the connection as it was in the other terminal. We were issued another boarding pass and had to wait another 2 hours for the next flight. That flight too was late leaving. We will never fly Alitalia again. Service is unreliable flight crew are indifferent and the washroom facilities during the flight are deplorable.
4324,I just traveled with my mother to Miami Florida from Calgary Alberta in April we bought our tickets online a month before our trip. We received the flight information by email everything was going fine. The flight down to Miami was great however the return trip was a different story again we checked-in the night before to save time but they overbooked the flight from Dallas to Phoenix and my elderly mother had to pay an extra 35 dollars to be guaranteed a seat on the flight to be able to stay traveling with me. I was asked to check in my carry on in Dallas because they were not going to have enough space in the overhead compartments. When we arrived in Phoenix they announced that the flight was overbooked and asked if anyone was interested in staying overnight and catch the morning flight to Calgary they offered to pay for the hotel and give you a travel voucher I could not take them up on the offer as I had already checked my carry on in Dallas. We bought our tickets a month before I felt that our seats should be guaranteed. The only saving grace of the trip was that the stewards were very nice on the flights.
4325,"As two couples we traveled Heathrow to Palm Springs via Dallas Fort Worth. The Heathrow flight was on time and the service was ok but not great. A little too ""matter of fact"" if I can use that term. Our flight from DFW was a different affair. Because we couldn't book our seats we were advised to ask at the desk at Dallas. When we arrived I was impressed that they knew we were coming but added"" we think we have four seats spare but leave it with us"". I had already had trouble booking seats from Heathrow with not wanting to pay and extra Â£30 pre booking fee! We eventually did get 4 seats. 2 at the front and two at the back. The attendants were efficient although abrupt. On our return flight again we couldn't book the seats we wanted and got split up yet again on DFW to Heathrow leg. The Staff were quite rude to all passengers. One fellow passenger asked what choice was for breakfast? ""Only one option"" was the reply ""take it or leave it""! We got the impression that they didn't really want to be there. Many reading lights and video screens were not working just what you need on an overnight transatlantic trip! We bought our tickets in September 2014 and we couldn't get seats together when it came to the 24 hr check-in. So what gives. I will say this now; we wont fly AA again and I will not recommend them either. They are advertising ""We are Adding new planes every week"" I think they should repair some of their existing ones first!"
4326,If you're flying out of Phoenix AZ area in the middle of the summer you may want to rethink this budget friendly airline! We arrived at the airport 2.5 Hrs prior to our flight leaving. Got through the baggage check security etc and arrived at our gate with about 1.5 hrs to spare. The temperature outside is well over 100 degrees so onboard the interior of the plane is very hot. Everyone is seated the plane is full and the flight attendants proceed to give the safety features etc meanwhile there is absolutely no air moving on that plane. I had no idea that Allegiant will not turn the air on until you've taken off! Meanwhile it is absolutely miserable! It would have been nice if the flight attendants would have at least made an announcement saying that they don't turn the a/c on until takeoff. The seats do not recline and there's very little leg room. I realize this is a cheap airline but I would rather pay more money to have the little extras like air conditioning during the summer in the desert seats that recline and free soda & snacks! After reading about others' horror stories with delays etc I'm thankful that we did not experience any of that! Our flights were on time but will not fly Allegiant again.
4327,When our daughter decided to get married in Las Vegas my husband and I were not able to find a return flight on the necessary day so we decided to split our flights and we took a competitor's airline going to Vegas and Allegiant coming home to Billings Montana. The flight to Vegas was a dream I wish I could say the same for the flight coming home on Allegiant. First we are charged $10 for our boarding passes even though I told the lady that I had them on my phone. Then she told us our flight had been moved up an hour so we ran through the airport made it through security and up to the boarding area only to be told that our flight time had not changed. Then we get on the plane and are told that there are snacks available but only if you pay for them and that includes water and ice. I could not believe that after paying $300 for our tickets we couldn't even get a bottle of water for free. Throughout the 90 minute trip the flight attendants only came out of their little cubby hole when they were doing the safety check and to go down the aisle to see if anyone wanted to buy anything. They were rude and spent the entire flight talking to each other about personal happenings. I thought that I would save a few dollars by taking Allegiant but in the end it ended up costing me more than any of the other airlines. I can honestly say that I would rather pay a little more to be able to get a drink of water if I need one and to have someone friendly and happy to see me come on board.
4328,My husband and I recently took a code share flight with Delta on Alitalia from Chicago to Rome. Flight #'s 629 ORD-FCO and 628 from FCO-ORD. Both flights were pretty much on time and boarding was a very organized way of doing things. The organization from Rome was a fiasco. There were not enough seats in the terminal at the gate causing everyone to crowd around the desk. It was impossible to see where we were to enter the process of boarding other than the blue carpet for the honorary fliers. This caused a huge crush when rows were called. It was chaos. The service on the plane was ok however the food was totally inedible. The snack on the return flight was tasteless. There were no air vents at the seats and the lighting on the sides of the airplane was out in many areas. The bathrooms were not in good repair and the TP ran out early although it was replenished at some point. The monitors were very far apart. If you weren't sitting in a seat close to one it was impossible to watch the programs.
4329,Both onward and return journey were delayed by 1 hour. On arrival at Rome airport there was no transit assistance offered as connecting flight to Bari was due to take off in 20 minutes. Security personnel in transit area not helpful and won't give fast track access when explained that we will miss our connecting flight if we join the long endless queue. Tried to speak to an Alitalia stewardess who totally ignore our calls for help. Finally we had to exit the terminal and walk to the departure terminal security and passport control run to the Gate number on our boarding pass and realised that they have made a late change to Gate number. Luckily the flight to Bari was also delayed and we didn't miss the flight. We didn't need to have this hassle if there was Alitalia attendant at hand to assist people on connecting flights.
4330,"Will not be flying with this airline again. Was traveling from Seattle to Houston Hobby through DFW. Plane was delayed on the runway for over an hour because American couldn't communicate with their own computer system in Dallas. Because of the delay we landed in DFW just 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to leave in another terminal. Hauled over to that terminal only to see a completely different flight posted at my gate with no agents in site. Found another gate with an agent and told him my situation. He put me on standby for another flight to Houston. I was called from the standby list and put on that flight they asked me to gate check my bag. Then after I was seated they called me off the airplane saying they had double booked my seat! They could not return my bag to me. Put me on yet another flight to Houston for two hours later. But that gate listed information for another flight. Talking with other customers it became clear that none of the gates displayed the appropriate flights it was utter chaos with agents switching gates for flights every 15 minutes or so and disgruntled passengers everywhere. Meanwhile it turns out that the flight they kicked me off of was cancelled because the pilot had reached his maximum number of hours before the flight ever left. Everyone on that flight was moved to my new flight. Eventually they boarded the flight and then sat at the gate for an hour because as the captain put it ""someone who needs to be on the flight is not on it."" The passenger sitting next to me showed me radar on her phone indicating that a storm was rolling in that would prevent us from leaving if we didn't leave soon. Many passengers started shouting to the crew asking why we hadn't left yet and many openly started wondering if the crew was actually making excuses to delay the flight until it was cancelled. Remember that many of these passengers had been on a cancelled flight just a few hours before. Anyway the captain did wait long enough that a storm rolled in as predicted. We were told we would need to fly out of the other side of the airport and circle around the storm so we taxied over. Once we were all the way on the other end we were told the new route required more fuel than we had so we had to return to the gate. Then we were told the ramp was closed so there was no gate for us to refuel at so we had to just wait. Finally a gate opened up for us but we just sat there for another hour. Then the captain told us that he reached his maximum number of flying hours so the flight was cancelled. At this point I cut my losses rented a car and drove to Houston from Dallas."
4331,Bellingham to Las Vegas - The MD80 was quite old but the cabin was clean and fine for a short flight. We had an aborted take off at Bellingham due to a faulty toilet. We stayed on the aircraft for an hour whilst they cleaned up the mess and took the lavatory out of service - lovely. At least we didn't have to change aircraft or get off the plane. We were on our way after an hour with no further delays or issue. The cabin crew were friendly and the pilots were very good at keeping everyone up to date with the delay and progress during the flight. I'd fly with Allegiant again although clearly they have reliability issues with their older aircraft which can cause unexpected delays but for the price I can't complain too much.
4332,Booked flight from JFK to Reggio Calabria with a stop in Rome. Flight left JFK over an hour late for no apparent reason other than waiting for late passengers. We originally would have 70 minutes to transfer in Rome. Because we left late we only had 30 minutes. My son and I ran to get to our gate and were able to arrive with 10 minutes to spare only to be told that our baggage will not make the transfer and we were not allowed to board without our baggage. We had to wait 4 hours for the next flight at 5.15 which did not board until after 5.20. Coming home was not any better. Flight from Reggio Calabria to Rome left over 30 minutes late and the flight from Rome back to JFK left over 20 minutes late. The only flight on time seemed to be the one that we were not allowed to be on.
4333,First experience of split flights - stop overs in FCO on way out and LIN on way back (LHR-CAT return). Booking flights only possible via Expedia (avoid) - simply did not show up on Alitalia website which also not good for non-Italian speakers. On line check in a delight. Ground staff not great - on way back told we were too early for check-in. Main problem was both initial flights were delayed an hour taking off and connection times were tight causing anxiety. In the event pilots radioed ahead flights were connected with and baggage no problem. Be aware there is no food on Millemiglia flights.
4334,This review is being written after a number of times flying with American Airlines. You can almost always expect delays terrible customer service and just an overall bad experience. We had a two hour delay from MIA to SFO which would connect to LAX. The airline representatives were not helpful and made our travel anxiety even worse. Absolutely the worst airline across the board-from aircraft to personnel. How could the customer service be so terrible? The only reason I chose this airline was because it was cheaper than JetBlue. American Airlines is truly a disappointment.
4335,A321 TPA-IA 737 MIA-YYZ. First leg delayed by over 1.5 hrs. Missed connection by 12 minutes. No apologies and stupid explanations. Put us on flight over 5 hours later. Once boarded we sat over an hour waiting for a pilot! Two different stories. Pilot delayed in traffic or pilot was timed out for his duty day and had to find someone else to drive the 737. And of course they lost our luggage. Is this any way for a major airline to operate?
4336,We had two flights with AA from Madrid to Miami with their 777. The first flight was five hours late no excuse no money. The B777 is one of the worst you can fly with - 2-5-2 seating but AA charges 100 Euro extra for the 2 seats-row. The seating is horrible no space in economy the in-flight entertainment is like 2002 with a small amount of films on re-run every 15 or 30 minutes (by the way my LCD did not work). The worst about AA is the staff - unfriendly tired and virtually throwing the trash food on your seat. Even for a US-carrier AA is under all poor standards. So - stay away. American is like Ryanair but not as cheap. Never again!
4337,Allegiant Air was a bad experience for me and my 7 year old. Booked a trip from Punta Gorda to Knoxville I almost didn't make out of Punta Gorda. We got to the airport early and then the flight was delayed (all of the flights were continuously delayed). One ticketing agent said it was weather but the weather was clear where the flight was coming from so I asked another agent and she said they didn't have enough crew. We were packed in that small airport like sardines with kids screaming people yelling not enough seats for people to sit in. They cancelled some of the other flights but finally got another plane and crew that came from Fort Lauderdale for my flight. Six hours after arriving at the airport we finally left. After this experience I will pay the extra money for another airline. My chances of getting out of an airport on time are better and at least I will have the option of being rebooked on another flight or getting compensated. Budget airline = budget experience.
4338,"Yes the price is certainly right and a direct flight is a definite plus especially for my husband who is handicapped. However in that vein this airline is certainly not handicap friendly. Ask for a wheelchair and they will sling one at you at the Check In (wherever that is in the airport). Upon disembarking the flight attendant announced that wheelchair persons would have to wait until all (159) passengers had left the plane. When my husband and I moved up to the front seats to wait at a break in the line the flight attendant said ""I told you to stay seated until all passengers had left the plane"". When a person finally arrived with a wheelchair and helped my husband up to the gate that's as far as they go. Carrying two bags of medical supplies and pushing the wheelchair we trudged off to baggage claim and then lugged everything out to the curb around the corner to a taxi. Had the same treatment on the flight home. But as I said the price is certainly right and you get what you pay for!"
4339,Aug 16 Boston - Rome FCO AZ 615 departure 5.10 pm. First stood 1 hour at the gate due to mechanical issues. After we finally took off the pilot informed us the landing gear was malfunctioning and after a fuel dump we would return to Boston. After an hour of circling above the greater Boston area he informed us to divert to New York JFK. No information yet. Three hours after initial departure we made and emergency landing at JFK. They kept us in the plane for an other hour let us wait for our luggage and let us stand in line form more then 3 hours to get hotel vouchers and rebooking to other flight. No drinks or beverages provided staff very unfriendly and uncoordinated.
4340,13 Aug Rome to Bucharest. Flight scheduled to leave at 21.30 and we waited on board until about 22.30 for the aircraft to leave. Cabin crew unfriendly and we were only given a small bag of taralli and a drink. Arrived at the airport (around 00.40) only to discovered one of our bags did not arrive.
4341,"Wife and I booked a trip from Houston to see the son in West Palm Beach on 4/17/2015. Our flight was supposed to be one of the first that left that day so we were ate the airport very early. Check in was 4 am. Of all the flights in the entire airport ours was delayed 2 hours. Why? Because they said it did not get in till late the previous day. Well that delay messed up our connecting flight in Dallas-Fort Worth so the day got worse and our total day was extended 6-7 hours. I understand that there are times when issues cannot be avoided but the airline booking personnel just didn't seem to care. We paid extra for the priority seating but they just threw us in the pool of last place seating until we got in their face. They did give us a meal voucher good for one of the vendors in the airport but only when we had to demand it. The pilot explained that there are rules of mandatory rest between flights which we understand but that news was known the previous day so why did we not get notified? The connecting flight was also delayed due to maintenance of passenger seats. For our return flight home my wife and I were praying for no issues but American Airlines made sure that we would not go home happy. The flight from West Palm Beach to Dallas-Fort Worth was pretty routine in the air but flight was delayed leaving the airport due to some ""auxiliary power"" issue that maintenance had to remedy before take off. When we arrived in Dallas-Fort Worth the powered boarding shute needed maintenance's attention before we could exit the plane into the terminal so we had to wait for that fix. As luck would have it our connecting flight was delayed another 1.5 hours! I will definitely find another airline before I choose this one again. The money you save does not justify the agony or grief this airline dishes out."
4342,Outbound flight Las Vegas to Grand Rapids (MI) was fine but on the return Allegiant had some staffing problems which led to delays and more delays and the flight eventually took off a full day late. It would not have been so bad if they had just been honest up front but they piecemeal the delays provided little information - and sometimes misinformation - and at times they were downright rude particularly on the phone where it was very challenging to get through in the first place. For the trouble they offered up a $100 voucher good only on the same route. The lost time and aggravation cost in many ways much more than anything I saved on a discount fare. Never again.
4343,Flew from Orlando (Sanford) to Grand Rapids MI. Just a few things to be aware of - the weight limit on checked bags is 40 pounds. You are allowed one free carry-on bag provided it will fit under your seat. You have to pay to use the overhead compartment (the overhead compartments were bare on my flight). The seats are tight and do not recline. While boarding and sitting on the runway - Allegiant turns the cabin air conditioning down to save fuel so depending on the outside temperature it can get pretty hot. Their airplane fleet is made up primarily of older McDonnell-Douglas MD-80's - cabins show their age - noises and creaks aplenty. The flight crew aren't particularly helpful or pleasant but suffice. Now the positive - my ticket was 139 dollars. There you go.
4344,"LHR-FCO-NRT / NRT-FCO-LHR. Generally ground staff at LHR and NRT were good and same for inflight cabin crew. Ground staff at FCO were unbelievably rude asking me questions about where I was going and why without even a ""I hope you enjoyed your trip!""."
4345,Milan - London LHR. A320 in Air One colours Leather seats but very dirty. Entire row of 6 had no inflight magazines two seats (out of 6) had a sick bag safety cards had chewing gum stuck to it. For over 2 hrs flight we were given A CHOICE of tiny pack of biscotti or salty snacks and a drink. Cabin crew spoke proper English but were not interested in any kind of service. I flown low costs with much better service than this.
4346,Wife and daughter were booked on Alitalia Flight 615 at 5.10 pm tonight from Boston to Rome. Alitalia boarded them waited an hour cancelled the flight for mechanical issues promised a new plane broke the promise made them wait 2 hours for their luggage and then put them in a line of hundreds of people to rebook. Alitalia 800 number refused to help - which guaranteed their passengers would almost all miss tonight's later flights to Europe.
4347,I was scheduled to fly from DFW to HOU Flight 5770 departing DFW 3.10pm arriving in HOU. Instead they notified us that there was no plane. We didn't have a plane to board until 5.30pm and the plane didn't depart until 6.20pm that evening. Over a 3 hour delay due to not having an available plane. Before we took off the pilot notified us that due to weather they were going to have to take a more Western route and were not sure if they were going to have enough fuel. Instead of actually getting more fuel we took off anyway. 30 min into the flight they notified us that there was a line to land into HOU due to weather and that they didn't have enough fuel and needed to land in San Antonio. Not only did we not get into SA until 8pm but the crew notified us that they had flown too many hours. So even if we did get more fuel there was no crew to fly the plane. At this point we were stranded in San Antonio and the weather had become so bad in Houston there were no planes out. We were stranded. After 2 hrs waiting in line the representative informed me I could not get back to Hobby until 7.30pm Monday. Monday I flew back to DFW 1433 to catch another plane 1489 to get to IAH by 12 noon. I took a cab from IAH to Hobby where my car was at b/c this was a better option than waiting all day to get back home. Practically over 24 hours to fly from DFW to HOU. I am extremely dissatisfied with American that I will no longer be flying this airline. Even though American did supply meal vouchers and put us in a hotel this is completely unacceptable.
4348,I know American is now responsible for US Air so I will put my comments here. I had a 4 leg trip from Houston to Ashville through Charlotte. Tickets were cheaper flying out of Bush but I will go through Hobby next time. Every leg of trip was delayed crowded or a rough ride. Seats were cramped. Snacks were to expensive. I checked my small bag to avoid the storage bin struggle. Our gate at Charlotte was doubled up for two flights from two major airports the information on screens was not updated with delays and confusing. I will pay more and fly another airline or drive before I fly American (US Air).
4349,My family and I were traveling on March 27 on flight AA 238 from (DCA) Washington Ronald Reagan National D.C. at 5.35 pm to (MIA) Miami International Airport. The airplane was old. We could see where the paint was chipped on the right wing. We had seats 15D 15E and 15F. The seat next to the window would not move back up after it was inclined back. We were landing and we pressed the button and could not get the seat to move back in an upright position. A male flight attention called my attention and I said I could not move it. He said that seats on American were more aesthetic than they are functional. The airplane lacked tray tables. Accordingly when served drinks there was no place to put the drinks. Furthermore not only were tray tables absent from this old plane but even the lock to hold them in place was gone from the plane. The plane had not been properly cleaned before the flight and our flight was overbooked. The seats were very narrow even though we paid for more better seats. My mother who is of normal weight and body proportions had difficulty getting in and out of it. Our earlier trip to Washington DC from Miami was on a newer plane and we didn't have these problems.
4350,8th April AA57. Return on AA56. This was our first and last trip with AA. We were told we would be flying on the new AA planes. This simply was not true. Why should one pay the same price if you are going to fly on a dirty broken old plane in business with a ridiculous 2 3 2 seating arrangement and the entertainment system broken. We will never fly AA again. They seriously need to up their game to compete with Emirates Singapore etc.
4351,GOA-ALG-GOA: 1st flight GOA-FCO on A320. No orange juice. No breakfast. Only coffee tea or water. In Rome 30 mins on the plane due to absence of mobile scales in FCO; FCO-ALG: A320 quite new. Personal monitor did not work. No white wine. On the way back (departure at 11.55 am) no lunch at all. Only 6 traditional biscuits. FCO-GOA 30 mins delay from Rome. Good connection for Algiers.
4352,Barcelona to Rome then connecting from Rome to Miami. We had reservations for the Classica Plus class seats on the Rome-Miami leg. In Barcelona they attempted to print our boarding passes for the second leg of the flight but were unable to after having us wait for over an hour while they attempted to do so. Apparently the original plane was switched to an aircraft without the Classica Plus section. Never informed of this change and apparently neither was the check-in desk in Spain. In Barcelona we were told to report directly to the gate in Rome where they would have our boarding passes. After racing through the airport in Rome and arriving at the gate we were told there was no Classica Plus on this aircraft. Rather than upgrade us to business class we were downgraded to economy class with four seats in the centre of the plane. We were told to go to the ticketing desk in Miami when we landed for a refund of the overcharge. In addition to the downgrade to economy class my reservation for a gluten-free meal was lost leaving me unable to eat most of the food available on the flight. When we finally landed two of our bags were missing. We were then told they were left in Rome. They were delivered late the next evening. We had to then wait at the ticketing desk for our refund. We are still awaiting a refund for the overcharge for economy class.
4353,The flight from Rome to Toronto 14 June was the worst flight I have experienced. Flight attendants were rude and inattentive. Most of them remained in the rear of the plane socializing. They failed to maintain even a semblance of cleanliness in the restrooms which by the flight's conclusion were filthy. The floors were strewn with wet paper towels the trash receptacle was overflowing and the sinks were clogged. Furthermore the seats had little or no padding some were actually repaired with masking tape. Only centre consoles were available for entertainment. A miserable experience.
4354,"This is a rough review because we flew first business and coach. We usually fly coach but for a trip to Napa we used our points to go first class. The AA/United merger combined the worst two airlines in the Western world. Flew on 4/7 (260 / 193) - BAN-DFX-SAN. Service food seating excellent. Plane a little old and shaky but all in all a good flight. Returned 4/13 (193/5290) SAN-Charlotte-BNA. Although we had first class we were relegated to business with an accompanying drop in quality across the board. The trouble is the age of the planes - it's like something from a museum. The noise from the engine was so loud it was like sticking your head under the hood of a car. But for once all flights left on time without mechanical problems. We were closer to the real world of 95% of all travelers with tasteless food (a box handed out at the end of a 6 hour flight with a roll candy bar and smoothy). Entertainment (quote unquote) was from attached dirty ancient screens for which AA would kindly sell earphones. I had my IPAD and kept busy while the Mrs tried to doze. Then at Charlotte it's Reality Time. We got bumped to economy (first row) but the constant groans reminded us that these ""seats"" were once used for unruly reform school students. That was in the 1940's since they were tiny dirty torn and stretched. The place looked filthy. A webbed shower curtain in several pieces separated ""first class"" (real classy) but they did manage to pass drinks to us in the cattle car. Yes we are switching carriers to anyone who has bought a plane in the last 30 years."
4355,AA flight 2891 on 19th Apr 2015. Flight was late 140 mins due to which I was sure to miss my next connection to Calgary. Technical faults do occur and are understandable. But the issue is how rude and uncooperative the staff were. They had a permanent no for an answer for everything in a most unprofessional way. As a last resort I was booked on same day from San Francisco to Calgary as it was very important for me to be there in Calgary. I had to rush and take ground transportation from Sacramento to San Francisco and working out the next step as I was moving ahead. Forget help no guidance was provided on how I can get to SF airport. Would have accepted same sequence of events if they were delivered to me with a smile. AA staff needs serious training in this aspect of customer service.
4356,AA 954 on 12th April 2015. Truly awful service from Buenos Aires to NYC. Flight staff were alternately incompetent angry or non-existent. Bizarre lack of professionalism creates a stressful flight atmosphere. With so many international options never again will we fly American. Not worth the few dollars saved on the ticket price.
4357,Flew from JFK to Palermo with a connection in Rome and from Catania to JFK connecting in Rome again. We had a two-hour delay sitting on the tarmac at JFK with NO information. Obviously missed our connection in Rome and were hustled off to a later connecting flight again with no information. On the return trip we again had a tight connection so our bags did not make it to JFK - and they weren't delivered to us for two more days. Flight attendants were rude and/or preoccupied. Food was inedible. I'll never fly Alitalia again.
4358,We booked a flight from New York City to Rome and Delta airlines farmed us out to Alitalia. We checked in online the night before our return trip and arrived at the airport 2 1/2 hours early for our flight. Only to be told the flight was overbooked and they gave our seats away. They were very rude and would not even try to explain why they gave our seats away. We were just told to go rebook. We went to that counter and they said they got us rebooked on another flight through Delta. We went to that terminal only to be told the ticket we had was for standby only as their flight was full as well. Alitalia did not care and just wanted to push us off to someone else. Delta were very professional and we're able to get us on a flight home. I will never travel by Alitalia again.
4359,"On April 9 2015 while my wife and I waited to board a flight from Barcelona to NY-JFK there was an announcement that it had been canceled. It was hard to hear and broadcast only once. Several of us had to confirm with an attendant that it was indeed canceled that we had to pick up our luggage at the baggage area and return to the check-in counter. My wife and I along with the others scrambled to navigate our way through the airport area finally to the baggage area. After what seemed like a very long wait our luggage along with a handful of others' came out last. This meant that when we finally found our way back to the AA check-in area we were at the end of an extremely long line. Eventually my wife and I ""split"" with her waiting on a long line at an AA service counter. After about 3 hours she made it to the front while I still had many people ahead of me. AA booked us on Iberia flights for the following day and a hotel with paid meals. We were then given directions to a free hotel shuttle. We never found it and ended up paying for a taxi but the driver took us to the ""wrong"" airport hotel. Fortunately that hotel let us take their shuttle to the ""right"" hotel. It's surprising but almost understandable that AA had no ""backup airplane"". My complaint is less about the cancellation and more about the lack of assistance at Barcelona Airport. Announcements and guidance was poor. There was no one to help us navigate back to the baggage area. We had to wait on a customs line to get back ""in"" so that we could go to the baggage area. We and others had to grab AA personnel passing by to find out anything even in the baggage area. It was an upsetting experience that cost us a day. We will think twice before using AA again & have spread the word wherever we can."
4360,My husband and our teenage son went to visit family in Nashville for two weeks this Easter. We booked our four flights each London-Chicago-Nashville and back through BA. BA were supposed to take us as far as Chicago with American Airlines doing the Chicago to Nashville bit. We missed our connection at both legs of the journey which was hugely inconvenient particularly when returning to the UK. To be fair AA brought us back to Chicago airport in time but for some reason the they were not given a gate for more than an hour. I approached the flight attendant asking whether AA can communicate with BA about this delay particularly as there were several people apart from us who were due to catch the same flight. She said that the flight will probably wait for us they know that we are being delayed. This resulted in a mad run between terminals 3 and 5 in vain. We were then sent back to AA desk in Terminal 3 to rebook our tickets for another flight. AA staff took a very long time to process each person. By the time we finished it was more than 1.5 hrs after we started queuing. We were told that the we will be put on AA flight to London tomorrow afternoon. There are many flights between London and Chicago and we requested an earlier flight. The person dealing with us said that if we wanted tickets to an earlier flight we should have come earlier. She refused to check whether BA had any flights the next day. In fact they were as unhelpful as possible. I made a point that we paid tickets for the flight that just left and had we managed to be on it we would not be asking for anything. We were told that we cannot collect our luggage as 'it has gone to BA'. We were given vouchers for an airport hotel and forced to stay overnight without luggage and they reluctantly gave us two sets of very basic things such as toothbrush and toothpaste for us three. The next day at AA check in desk we were told we need to collect our luggage at luggage collection No 5 after which we needed to bring it back upstairs and check them in. They could not locate our luggage. As the time for our next flight was approaching my husband ran to the check in desk to let them know that our luggage never materialised whilst I waited at carrousel No 5 in case it does. We asked if we could be upgraded if there were any spare seats in the premier class and the staff member said 'we do not upgrade for such a reason'. No other option would make me use this airline again.
4361,Nothing seems to have changed since privatisation. Apart from the fact that prices have gone up and a meal is no longer offered including on 3 hours from London to Rome. Check-in staff rude at London Thessaloniki and Rome. Asked to check in an extra bag due to a medical condition and still within the baggage limitations but was asked to pay 40 euros. Flight was only half full. Also very difficult to find the gate for the connecting flight. Crew were only friendly on leg Rome-Thessaloniki and there doesn't seem to be consistency with the service. Only Italian customers seem to get asked whether they want sweet or savoury biscuits. Otherwise they don't even greet when you board and seem preoccupied with their own chat. London to Rome half an hour late without an announcement or apology. There was a customer satisfaction survey on board between Rome and London but only a hand-full of people were picked not sure according to what criteria.
4362,"Non-existent customer service. Recently flew JAN-DFW-ELP. Delayed and missed connection in DFW due to weather. Had to overnight. No help whatsoever from AA because of ""weather"". No vouchers no distressed travel rates no phone number to call for booking my own hotel and had to walk 20 gates for hilariously cheap toiletries kit that was given grudgingly. Surly agents throughout. Truly an example of the worst in airline culture. To top it all off was unable to be booked on next morning flight and missed work. Agent could only put me on a later flight. Said I was put on FC upgrade list however. The next day when I was told I was upgraded they wanted $70 for the 1 hr flight. Agent said ""well it's not free"". I am AAdvantage Gold which is meaningless. Now a hostage to them with my new location but will take United or Southwest whenever possible in the future. People understand weather issues but the total lack of even the most basic customer service and rude behavior/attitudes is appalling about this ""airline"". Previously flown with Delta extensively and they always handled weather delays and misconnections in ATL professionally and courteously. So it can be done AA just doesn't care."
4363,Original flight was scheduled to depart at 10.30 am from DFW. Flight delayed too many times to count. Right now we are at 4 hours past (2.30 pm) I am on the plane have been sitting here with no air flow or electricity for about an hour. We were told that the flight crew was coming from OK however all the passengers from OK are on board and the flight attendants said they could not find pilots. This type of incompetence and lack of communication does not instil a lot of confidence in my safe arrival at my final destination. Although AA was $100 cheaper than United I will never fly with AA again.
4364,Flew American three times in the past two weeks. All domestic. 1) San Francisco to O'Hare Chicago. 2) LaGuardia NYC to O'Hare Chicago. 3) O'Hare Chicago to San Francisco. Good: on time performance. Did not experience delays Bad: 25$ for a checked luggage? Come on! What are you? A Low Cost Carrier? And because of this many people opted for a carryon resulting in overcrowding of overhead bins. There were simply not enough space for all carry-ons. Bad: flight attendants! No smiles! Not very attentive. They looked tired grumpy and stressed! Bad: IFE! No individual screens. Bad: old single aisle Boeing planes. Bad: you have to pay for everything. Complimentary drinks limited to water canned sodas and juices.
4365,LIN-FCO-IST-FCO-LIN. Check-in at Linate was done over the phone so I just had to pick my boarding pass at the counter. Polite staff at the gate changed my seat on the FCO-IST to a better selection. LIN-FCO was a great flight everything smooth and good service. Flight to IST was terrible rude staff and poor food availability. Only a cookie for a 2 hr international flight. Return flight was even worse rude flight attendant and very unhelpful. Service still below standards and lacking. FCO-LIN was a delight compared to the previous flight. Flight crew was totally on another level making the flight enjoyable. No consistency on this airline and should also focus not only on their major route between Milan and Rome.
4366,LHR-DFW return on 777-300ER. I booked this route especially to take this newer plane for the inflight entertainment which did not disappoint. I found the crew okay and some even smiled! What I disliked about AA was the exorbitant prices they charge for pre-allocated seats which was a necessity in order to seat a family of 4 together. The food was mostly below average but having read reviews I wasn't surprised. I don't like the way they have chosen to add another seat to each row in economy. So instead of 9 abreast they have made it 10. This makes the aisle ridiculously narrow and I don't see how hundreds of people would be able to escape in an emergency so I'm surprised the FAA permits this higher density seating. Legroom was tight for anyone of above average height. I also found it strange how the seat belt sign was illuminated for virtually the whole flight - in both directions - and there are hardly any announcements from the flight deck even when turbulence is quite choppy. I chose AA for the equipment they use on this route but I would think twice about booking them again due to the hidden costs that aren't factored into the ticket price.
4367,I have just flown American from London to Miami with a connection to Cancun. The flight AA 57 due to leave at 9.45 am from London was delayed by 1hr 35 minutes with no apology or explanation as to why. The delay coupled with a customs shambles in Miami meant we missed our connection. The Express tickets (red ones) were a complete waste of time we just joined the queue with everybody else and the lady at the next baggage check in was totally disinterested and dismissive. I am frequent flyer an this was booked via BA and was a very poor customer experience. I will avoid American at all costs in future.
4368,LHR-MIA March/April. We were sold this round trip on the 'new' AA Business Class product. We knew it was a 777-300ER LHR-MIA and a 777-300 back. The outbound was fantastic with great service seats AVOD and everything one should expect from a modern BC cabin. we have flown Emirates BC 4 times in the past 6 months and this cabin is comparable to both the A380 and the 777 in that class defining airline. Whilst we found the service in Emirates a bit disorganised AA was efficient friendly and warm we like the more mature no nonsense crew on Airlines out of the States although it's a thin line to rude and dis-interested on occasions! However AA should be ashamed scheduling a 200 version for the return leg which was not a result of a last minute 'change out' due to failure but that quote ' The newer plane has been stolen for Los Angeles some weeks ago'. Call me sad but I would have changed my flight if I'd known we'd be on this antique! Lie at an angle beds a 10 inch screen maybe 11 low def (love the jumpy fuzzy effects reminded me of the 90s) and the general feel of a very tired plane! What was different was the excellent service and food I was annoyed when I sat down but slept for 3 hours and was relaxed when I got off. AA has begun to catch up it's got some way to go and given the lounge experience (don't ever ever call sparkling wine Champagne!) there is a way to go the crew are spot on and at the end of the day that's what makes a flight. Seat score is for the 777-300ER but oddly it's not great for couples as these seats are very. 'Pod' like and chatting to each other isn't easy AVOD score is the new plane.
4369,After some apparent misrepresentations about our 1st plane we left Sanford at about the same time that we should have arrived in Allentown. Of course we boarded a 2nd plane only about 1.5 hours late but could not depart because it had an A/C problem which was corrected in a mere hour as we sat entombed under the FL sun! No flight attendants displayed name badges. Does that tell you anything?
4370,We have just travelled from Rome to Barcelona and paid Â£845 for two business class seats. We had just finished a cruise and had a lot of luggage and we didn't want hassle with excess luggage costs etc. There were 3 people including us in business. Although there were 3 stewardess's we were not greeted at all. 20 minutes into this short flight we still had not seen a stewardess so I rang the button and asked for a drink. My wife asked for a G and T and I asked for a glass of Champagne. No gin no vodka and needless to say no Champagne. The White wine offered was warm and undrinkable. The food was terrible too. After serving the food we didn't see the stewardesses again. They shut the curtain and spent the rest of the flight chatting.
4371,Flew Boston to Barbados via Miami March 10 returning March 17. Managed to buy a cheap upgrade to First Class Boston to Miami which was good - though American airlines first class doesn't measure up to the first class of other airlines. One good flight out of four. The rest was economy all the way and truly miserable. Miserly leg room have to pay extra for everything ground staff ranged from hostile to comatose cabin crew completely indifferent. Was made to feel like a dollar bill squeezed till I squeaked. AA operates for its shareholders not its passengers.
4372,Flew from San Francisco to DFW (Dallas) for my connection into Houston Hobby (04/05/15) just to sit around for hours the airline changed the departure time at least 7 times then in the end it was cancelled and do you think they had the decency to have a ticket agent at the booth no mysteriously the agents all disappeared right before the cancelled notice went up on their board. No one instructed us to do anything I went to other agents and they just told us they could not help. Just ridiculous all around meanwhile Mother's and children traveling alone sitting at the gate crying trying to figure out how they were going to get home. I ended up having to get a rental to make it to my final destination on my own. All American Airlines does is inconvenience people the final straw was when the agents at the rental car counter stated that American does this every week to folks who are going to Houston Austin and Lufkin so it was nothing new to them they claim mechanical failure! If they supposedly have new planes and they are investing in all this new equipment where is it? Why don't they use some of those new so called planes they have purchased! This was a less than an hour flight come on American have some common sense!
4373,From LAX to PVG (Shanghai) the worst business class. Most of the flights to Asia have much better business seating. The middle row has three seats if you are in the middle of the middle row you must cross someone to get in and out. The seats configuration is old and looks very dark and unpleasant. Larger screen for movies but not very many good selections.
4374,July 31st stuck at airport. Flight has been delayed. From all the reviews I have read this is apparently a reoccurring issue with this airline. Allegiant need to get their act together. They charge for everything so don't think you are saving money because you are not. You can fly better airlines and save yourself the stress.
4375,AA are making a big thing about all the new planes they are buying. I flew from Heathrow to JFK 27th March on a really smart 777. That's where the complements end though. I have never flown with a worse cabin crew. They all wore different clothing as though they had turned up from home and not bothered to change. They were totally uncommunicative - amazingly not a word was spoken to us through the entire journey. One of the crew fell asleep in a seat at the back of the cabin. Food was served as though they were doing us a favour and just dropped in front of us without a word there was not a friendly smile between them. One of the crew was not tall enough to close the overhead lockers. I cannot believe AA are spending so much on renewing their fleet yet seem totally unconcerned that their staff are behaving in this way. I flew back on BA - a fabulous crew who worked their socks off for the customers what a contrast!
4376,AA flight 397 on March 25th. The first leg of our trip was delayed so we arrived at the gate 7 minutes before the flight was to take off. We had notified the gate agents that we were on the way to the flight but they shut the door in our face and would not let us board. We found out they had overbooked the flight by 50 seats. On the next flight we watched as friends of the gate agents boarded on standby while the rest of us were bumped > again. No gate agents seemed interested in helping us get home. We eventually had to rent a car and drive home since American Airlines would not give us a seat on any flight to get home. An extra $100 and 10 hours delayed we arrived home.
4377,LHR to MIA Business Class. The plane was one of the older 777-200 with 2-3-2 seating meaning that the person in the middle always had to disturb someone to get out. The seat was ok but not really a true flat bed. The VOD was patchy in that on two of the films I watched there was something wrong with the display so I had to stop it and restart it. The food was very nice - my steak was delicious. Cabin crew were all very friendly and accommodating.
4378,Allentown to Orlando Sanford on 28th July 2014 and return flight from Orlando Sanford to Allentown on 1st August 2014. Very poor quality airline used them from PA to Florida and back and they were over 3 hrs late going and 2 hrs late returning the staff attitude ranged from poor to average and if I had a choice I would not fly with them again.
4379,Travelled with AA February 2015 LHR-MIA return flight out older plane - adequate for a day flight. Thankfully new plane with fully lie flat bed. On return excellent service from cabin staff food also beyond expectations.
4380,I flew Manchester to JFK and return with AA. On arrival at Manchester the airline staff quizzed us in detail about where else we usually travelled to why we were going to the States what jobs we did. This took about 10 minutes. Check in was via a machine designed to make AA a staff saving however it did nothing for their customers most of whom were frustrated at its inability to work. The whole crew were late and ran through the airport together to take up their posts. Did this account for them not checking whether the passengers had on their seat belts or arm rests in the correct position? Apparently not as it was exactly the same on the return flight. The safety video could not be viewed by passengers seated by the window due to the low overhead and central hanging videos. Did the crew have a uniform? They all dressed differently some wore extensive amounts of jewellery and chewed gum others had not even combed or tidied their hair. All were markedly scruffy compared to every other airline I have ever flown with. More worrying was that none of the crew advised passengers to remain seated when the seat belt light was lit and passengers proceeded to walk around the cabin throughout the flight. Or maybe it was the Captain's error in not turning the light off at all. Who knows whether we even had a Captain as on the out flight no announcements were even made! Not impressive on safety at all. Lets face it food comfort etc are also important but if an airline fails on basic safety the rest pales to insignificance.
4381,I have the time to write this review due to the third delay I've had with this airline. Not a single good thing I can say about my experience with American. I have flown Southwest Delta Jetblue Frontier and this is by far the worst airline I have flown. We had an hour and a half delay the first flight plus an emergency situation so we missed our connecting flight which has never happened to me. They supplied us with the worst hotel overnight. It wasn't just us that missed our flight 5 other families on separate ones missed theirs too. Then the flight the next day got delayed 30 minutes! So our three day trip turned into one day from all the delays and missed flights. Finally heading home and they announce mechanical problems with the plane. So now the flight is delayed 2 hours and we are missing our connecting flight to Salt Lake. So we get to board on a 6 pm flight but let's not kid ourselves that'll be delayed too so probably 7. And then it's a 4.5 hour flight so I'll be getting home at 2am. Other airlines can figure it out so please do to and spare us all the pain and frustration.
4382,I thought this was one of the worst travel experiences I've ever had. It was the first time I flew with my 5 month old daughter we were the last to board my husband and son boarded first they had no priority boarding for people with small children the aircraft was old and dirty. There was a charge for everything including carry ons which I paid but refused to pay the fee to sit together. I thought the airline was tacky and cheap. I can understand paying for something that's new or worth it but this airline was old and sub standard. Luckily it was a short flight.
4383,Flew RDU-LHR on a free economy ticket. I prefer other airlines but the RDU-LHR non-stop convenience trumps all. It also gives me the opportunity to judge the progress of the AA/USAir merger. On the downside the venerable 767-300 is one year older (27 years and counting) still has the mail slot overhead storage bins the ancient hanging screen entertainment and the excruciatingly uncomfortable seats. I did notice that this old warhorse had been updated with blended winglets to save money which I'm certain they pass along to those paying for tickets. On board the hot breakfast croissant has been replaced with a box of sugar laden treats and the dinner has regressed from merely uninteresting to inedible. The flight attendants are excellent given what they have to work with - even giving up their crew rest seats to accommodate the spring breakers who made this a 100% full flight. On the plus side a current movie that I had considered paying to see (Whiplash) swift check-in and 45 minutes early into LHR. AA doesn't seem challenged to upgrade their transatlantic game but unless you're flying from RDU there must be a better option to get from the U.S. to the UK.
4384,Flew JFK to Manchester. First disaster came when checking in for flight to be told as a group of 6 we couldn't be seated together. Then it got worse as we couldn't be sat as couples unless we paid $260.00 per couple. Once on board we were sat apart. The cabin crew were at best unkempt and rude. The meal we were served was awful. Only 1 toilet was working for the full economy cabin on a 757 this is not good on a 6 hour flight. Overall a disappointing experience and will not fly on American again.
4385,Flew from CVG to Myrtle Beach on July 18th (flight 1113) and returned to CVG on July 25th (6pm gate B2). Both flights were delayed for over 2 hrs. The return flight was loaded and taxied with a 30 minute delay the final 1.5 hours was sitting on a plane with no air in the Myrtle Beach sun. Staff was nice and did their best older flight attendant (woman) was spectacular. Sorry doubt if we will use this airline again.
4386,London - Miami Return January 2015 (Boeing 777). I could only choose where I wanted to sit 24 hrs before my flight which was fine as most airlines have that policy but what really threw me back was that all aisle and window seats cost an extra $69 - $100 each way depending where the seat was located! You have to pay extra for an aisle seat at the back of the plane on a 10hr transatlantic flight? This is not easyjet or Ryanair for goodness sake! The so called cheap flight on a major airline was not so cheap after all as they were already nickel and diming before getting off the ground. I refused to pay and went for a free middle seat which I loath I have wide shoulders and have to hunch inwards my plan was to arrive early and hope the check-in desk could sort me out with an aisle seat which they were able to do but that is where the Customer satisfaction stopped.) Plane was on time and boarding was reasonably quick and I was perched in my aisle seat which was very narrow I also noticed many people getting their roller cases stuck in the aisles as they tried to roll them down but it turns out that in an effort to squeeze an extra seat in each row American Airlines compromised with narrower seats and aisles. In the air nightmare #1 The narrow aisle caused one particular cabin crew to bump the trolley into my shoulder or elbow without even so much as an apology. #2 You get free beer and wine but the entire cabin ran out beer and white wine before the first drinks trolley finished its first pass. #3 The plane was old and the only movies available played at set times (not on demand) that's right 2015 with 90s technology - AA may have painted their planes but they are still old and nasty inside. Worst of all it was the same experience on the return leg mercifully the flight was 60 mins less - A truly awful transatlantic flight!
4387,Flying home from Rochester NY to Los Angeles CA I had to change planes in Chicago. Our flight from Rochester landed with plenty of time to make the connecting flight. One problem is that we had to park on the tarmac for one and a half hours. Another plane was occupying the gate. When we reached the gate it took the employees forever to bring up the valeted bags. I missed the connecting flight and it was late in the evening so there wasn't any available flights. I asked about other airlines in the morning and was told nothing was available. I was given stand-by for AA in the morning and if I didn't make that then an 8.05 pm flight was booked for me. AA wouldn't pay for a hotel room so I was on my own. Once I got to a hotel and started my computer I found a United and Virgin America flight for the morning. Of course it cost me more money but I had a meeting the next day and couldn't risk the stand-by status. What a difference dealing with Virgin America customer service over American Airlines. I will only use AA as a last resort in my future trips. American couldn't tell me how many people were on stand-by for the morning flight so I could evaluate my chance of boarding.
4388,My daughter and I flew from Avoca Pa to Sanford Orlando from July 3-10. We greatly enjoyed our smooth flights and onboard service. However there were delays going down and coming back of about an hour. I know Allegiant has great deals but need to improve on these delays for better traveling. Even though there were delays I will still chose Allegiant for future travels due to the value and convenience.
4389,What is the point in paying extra for Priority when the seats are still the same size? Not to mention the overhead bins are not full yet you made me check my one carry-on. This is ridiculous. I planned ahead and packed lightly so I could use a small carry bag. I have an appointment when I land and cannot wait for Baggage Claim. What should have been offered was Priority Baggage PickUp. These items should come off the plane first and be stowed with strollers or other items along with First Class baggage. I will avoid this airline at all costs going forward.
4390,DUS-ORD-Tampa-LAX-ORD-DUS. We fly on European carriers quite often - but American Airlines have made an art of employing non caring - ignorant and unfriendly staff. I have never encountered such condescending flight attendants - and such arrogance. We flew from Dusseldorf to Chicago as first leg. The seat allocation was a disaster at the airport - my wife was in a middle seat 6 rows behind me. When we asked the check in crew to change it - we were told to take care of it at the gate at the gate we were told to sort it with the cabin crew and the cabin crew? Not our problem - you should have taken care of it before boarding - end of interest. Only after I really got angry - and walked off the plane - telling them to get my luggage off - a steward from the front end of the plane got involved and shuffled people around so we could sit together. Our friendly stewardess then managed to ignore us for the whole trip. Second leg - we were on the last row of an ancient DC9 - with the galley next to us and a toilet door that would not close properly. Return trip uneventful - but one thing is certain - never again American.
4391,AA78 DFW-LHR March 6 2015. What a disappointing flight on one of AA's ancient 777-200 cabin feels more like a prison cell than business class. Seats in 2-3-2 configuration (haven't had this for 15 years now). Instead of lie- flat seats they still offer lie in s-style and be careful not to slip down to the floor while you sleep. Stewardess climbing over me to cut off the way she had to walk. Food was disappointing as well. Only highlight was the wine selection that was a little bit better than ok. No way that I will use AA again.
4392,Flew from Ashville to Punta Gorda. When I got to the airport I was told that the flight was delayed due to a mechanical we were expected to be late about 3 hours no offer of a voucher for a meal nor did they apologize it was very matter of fact. When we boarded the plane the first thing I noticed was how dirty and tattered the plane was it was an older MD-80. My seat was clean didn't recline I was more annoyed with the garbage that was surrounding my seat and in my seat back pocket and when I rang my Flight Attendant call light I was approached by a rude older male flight attendant who refused to take the garbage until after we took off. Once we were at cruising altitude the crew came out and sold all sorts of snacks and beverages not bad. Had an issue with my hand baggage being in the aisle. Allegiant as a whole was not a bad experience the ticket was inexpensive I would like if Allegiant perhaps gave their Flight Attendants especially those lovely seniors a class in etiquette and professionalism.
4393,I traveled reluctantly on American Airlines Buenos Aires - New York and return in early December 2014. On the most recent trip I can only say that the seating was horrible the flight attendants inattentive. I did like two attendants on the return flight one a male who saw the girl sitting next to me unwilling to put her tray up for takeoff and he firmly said 'you know the drill put the tray up'. You could sense his professionalism and no nonsense approach. He was quite professional. Another attendant was very personal with me and admitted that flying was not what it used to be said that the 777-300 had two back seats that you could not recline and actually defended the passenger in terms of lack of comfort. She said that now it is a question of bringing your own entertainment food all of which surprised me since she was not party line and quite personable apologizing for making me wait ten minutes for some water saying 'I'm sorry I'm in another world today' not so reassuring but she was on top of things. A mixed bag. On the flight to New York the food was awful but a flight attendant when telling her that I need a lot of water subtly gave me an entire bottle in a plastic bag. Perhaps it's because I helped an older passenger with her luggage but still what a shocker. I find that I am very uncomfortable getting off their planes. They have twice lost my luggage once on an earlier flight but found it days later. The latest was really just uncomfortable because of the 2x5x2 seating arrangement on a 777-200. I cannot recommend them for comments like 'whose the next victim?' or 'the entertainment system is not working. We suggest you read a good book and go to sleep'. This was on a flight Buenos Aires New York about three years ago stated in Spanish and English by a flight attendant. Passengers laughed but you could see many were offended by her suggestions. It used to be a great carrier.
4394,Sitting at AEX. Flight 3271 was scheduled for 6.05am. It is currently 8.20am and still not boarded. There is always delays. I travel for business and American is so inconsistent it makes it hard for the business traveler.
4395,"TOL (Toledo) Ohio to PGD (Punta Gorda) Florida. Check In: Went smooth no issues with checking in and sent on my way. Security: Efficient and quick. Boarding: Very unorganized the gate agents didn't seem to have a grasp on customer service either. Boarding announced by someone who couldn't speak properly into the phone and 90% of her message never came through we all just sort of looked perplexed and formed a queue only to be snapped at for not boarding in the correct manner of which we never really heard. Upon entry into the old and tattered MD-80 we were greeted by a very sweet young lady and an older middle aged asian man who never smiled and he swiftly snapped at me ""Seat Sir"" he was the lead flight attendant and we all would endure his wrath later. Flight: Take off was quick the crew were up and out in the aisle within an hour after take off that probably had something to do with the argument the flight attendants were having in the rear. Once in the aisle the crew were pleasant and were very happy to be doing their jobs or at least they appeared so. Overall: You get for what you pay for apart from that not too bad."
4396,"Oakland CA to Provo Utah. Initially I was very excited to use this airline as I saw that the price for the trip was much less expensive than the usual commercial airlines flying into SLC. However I was disappointed as I continued the checking process and realized that I had to pay additional money for seats and for carry-on luggage. I then realized the total cost is not that significantly cheaper than Delta or another big airline. However I bought my tickets only 3 weeks in advance and may have saved significant money if I had purchased the tickets much earlier. I arrived to OAK 2.5 hours early in case there were any problems. Security clearance was a breeze. I am happy to say that there were no issues with delays or cancellations on this leg of the trip. The service was very good. Yes all beverages/snacks must be purchased but it is only a 1.5 hr flight and really who needs to drink/eat in that time. I can see why customers complained about the comfort of the seats as the backs are very thin and do not give a lot of cushion support. Anyway I had paid for a first row seat and I'm glad I did as I could easily get off the plane without waiting. I'm happy to say that I had no problems with my flight but I do wish the total price of the trip was much more of a ""deal"" than what I got in reality."
4397,Flew July 11 2014 from Las Vegas to Casper WY - flight attendants were either inattentive or rude. Thought it was just a one time occurrence but we flew back from Casper WY to Las Vegas on Monday July 14th and the crew was worse. Plane was filthy front lavatory was inoperable. Spend the extra money and fly on an airline that at least acknowledges that are a person first and a customer second!
4398,Recently we traveled to Cancun from Calgary Canada with an over nighter in Dallas Fort Worth. Our flights down were for the most part uneventful with only minor delays out of Calgary and Dallas. However coming back on the 28th of Feb was the worst experience we have ever had in over 30 years of flying. We were stuck in an enormous backlog of passengers in Cancun Airport the majority of the backlog was with American Airlines. Not withstanding the fact that there were storms all over the southern US the American staff assisting passengers in the line-up un-organized cluster that accrued in the terminal was appalling! They could not organize anything and upset passengers constantly. They were so incompetent that they would have had difficulty organizing a staff bathroom break. We where in the line-up for 5.5 hours and never saw a listing for our flight till we finally went through security and even then they had the gate location mixed up. A horrendously poor experience.
4399,"I had an unpleasant experience with this airline on Sunday March 1st. I took a flight from Houston to Chicago then had an hour to connect to my flight to Toronto. The first leg was fine on time and was surprised that a meal was served on a short two hour flight. I got to Chicago checked the departure board and saw my flight was delayed an hour. That was not too bad so I used the washroom came out to get a coffee and decided to check the board for the gate again and to my surprise my flight was then listed as cancelled. Told that even though I had booked first class if I wanted to get to Toronto the next morning it would be in the back of economy told that the only first class available would be in two days. The biggest surprise came shortly thereafter when I went to search for a Customer Relations desk: there was none! There was a system of phones. Eventually a CS agent came to the phone. She told me that the previous gate agent booked me for the following night from Chicago to Philadelphia then a six hour wait to board a 7 am flight back up to Toronto getting me to my destination two days after the original time. I instead took charge and asked if I could get a flight to Buffalo and was placed on one for two hours later. Of course ""weather"" was the cause for the delay but oddly enough only my flight was showing up as being cancelled. I fly often so if weather was a major factor the board should have at least a few more cancellations or delays. Because of this ""weather"" excuse there would be no assistance for a hotel. I was to depart from the L gates and just before boarding there came an announcement that we had to go over to the H gates- - with just minutes to spare. Service has been much better to me by other US based airlines when faced with unusual changes such as weather or mechanical delays-I have had them all. I will stick to my preferred airline and not use AA anymore as this experience plus a similar one last summer with them has completely eroded any confidence that this airline can get me from point A to B on the same day."
4400,MSP-MIA. A battered old airplane arrives at the gate looking like it would be from 1960. We got inside and some of the monitors were not working and the seats barely reclined. The flight attendants were very nice and passed out drinks but I still don't understand why they do not offer snacks on a 3.5 hour flight. My flight from MIA-MSP was terrible. We arrived at MIA airport getting ready for our flight at 1pm. We find out it is cancelled and the airline did not give us a reason why so we were rescheduled for a 2pm flight. When we went to board the 2pm flight we find out that they cancelled our seats for that flight and replaced them with a 9pm flight. We had to stay in MIA airport for an additional 7 hours! Once the time finally comes to board the flight bound to MSP we get onto the plane which previously came from Mexico City. The flight attendants were very welcoming however they then tell us over the speaker that this plane was out of service and that American Airlines must find us a new plane to fly on. So we get all of our luggage off the plane and leave the gate once again tired and exhausted. We wait in the gate area and find out our plane is located at the opposite end of MIA airport a 25 minute walk/train ride to get to. So we get all of our stuff together and head towards the other gate. Boarding begins immediately on one of the brand new planes and it is delayed an additional hour. The flight finally leaves at 11pm and I was supposed to be home at 6pm originally. We got to Minneapolis at 2am. Do not recommend this airline if you have little kids with you as changes to occur commonly but the flight attendants are great. The flights not so much. American has really gone down in service.
4401,Our flight to Oakland from Phoenix-Mesa was delayed 3 hours (no other flights in either area were delayed) and then we waited an hour at Oakland until our luggage came. No explanation was given. I am currently at the gate waiting for my return flight which was just delayed 40 minutes because one of the flight attendants has not arrived yet.
4402,I recently used this airline to travel round trio from Belleville IL to Orlando FL. I suppose to summarize I would categorize this as a fair airline. If you are planning travel with them make sure you take note of all the charges as basically everything (including advance seat selection etc) has an a la carte separate charge. Also the departing flight was two hours late and there was no explanation given by Allegiant staff as to why. The advantage of this airline is it flew out of a small general aviation airport that obviated the need for me to travel to St Louis. Recommended but be aware of all charges and propensity to lateness.
4403,I cannot find one thing to say about this airline that is complimentary. Had a flight from Orlando to home and arrived 2 hrs early. Line and kiosks were absolutely packed. And why is that? Because there are only 2 check in people working. Of course I am late for my flight and spend the rest of the day trying to get on a stand by. AA workers at the gates very unhelpful and dismissive. Tell me if I am not some kind of gold customer I cant be put on a stand by list. Terrible customer service in every way. I will never fly them again and do not recommend anyone else to either!
4404,After a cruise in Ft. Lauderdale we took a connector flight to Dallas on the way to Phoenix. Upon arrival had to sit in the plane 2.5 hours as there was a plane in our gate. Because of snow and ice on runway and also because Dallas is not prepared for this and American could not find a pilot we were cancelled. So for the next 24 hours we spend in the Dallas Fort worth airport we spend 8 hours waiting in lines for a flight and slept along with about 100 people on the floors and in chairs in the airport as the hotels were full. I felt sorry for seniors would had to endure this drama as there was little to no help from American Airlines. Finally after 2 cancellations and 1 standby refusal we found a flight to Phoenix.
4405,Flight from MSP to DFW to MIA was late both flights and each time they were highly unorganized. Late to board and very uninformative to passengers. Flight itself ok. Very uncomfortable seats and I'm an extremely small figured person. Flight returning from MIA to DFW and then to MSP was a disaster! Got to the airport 2.5 hrs early and had American Airlines bump my flight unbeknown to me to a following day! They put me on standby with a confirmed seat and then argued when I didn't get on that I was late when I was there an hour before departure. They did not out me on and when talking to a supervisor and his pawn they did nothing claiming it was not their fault even though I had a confirmed seat on time and they bumped me. They did nothing to appease the situation and the girl behind the counter was very rude! I will never fly them again. Disorganized unprofessional and expensive!
4406,"After 30+ years of flying American I will now avoid them. My flight from Heathrow to Miami ""First"" was appalling with a complete lack of the usual amenities. The plane was old and tired media system small and ancient only 1 current movie of interest terrible food (inedible) and tantamount to false advertising in my eye to call this ""first class"". Be warned that unless you know the exact year and configuration of the plane you are flying the customer service department won't give you a definite answer you may have the same experience."
4407,Fly from GSP to SFB frequently. If you like riding a bus this is the airline for you. Cheap yes. In every way. Their fares look great until you start adding up all the extra charges. Never on time and if you have baggage pack a meal while you wait for it! Most uncomfortable seating ever. I guess if you only fly once a year it's OK to be inconvenienced but if you need to be somewhere on time look elsewhere!
4408,On July 3 I lflew out of Asheville NC for Sanford/Orlando as this was my first time flying with Allegiant. I printed out my online boarding pass arrived before the time indicated and received an official boarding pass which indicated which gate I was to go to board the plane. The flight was on time and the pilot and crew were very courteous. Was a great flight! However the return was a disaster! On July 6 I was to fly out of Palm Beach Intentional. As before I printed my online boarding pass and arrived before the time indicated. This time I did not receive an official boarding pass indicating what time I was to go to board the plane. Instead I received the printed boarding pass that I proved which was torn in half and the gate number written on it. She instructed me to go to the left towards security and afterwards I would see the areas that indicated which gates. I went through security as usual and then proceeded to the gate written on the boarding pass. At the gate there were very few people there and I saw no Allegiant advertising. I asked someone who worked at the airport and she said yes you have the right gate. Since ever all flights were being delayed due to bad weather in the area I thought mine had been as well. About 10 minutes after the flight was to take off I saw one of the Allegiant employees who had been checking people in when I arrived. I asked if the flight had been delayed. She told me no I had missed my flight. I showed her my boarding pass with the hand written gate number on it. She informed me that that was the wrong gate and that she didn't recognize the hand writing. I feel that if I had been given an official boarding pass that indicated the gate number I would not have missed my flight.
4409,Flew AA Cost Rica-Miami-Toronto. Ancient airplanes with drop down televisions every few rows. Couldn't read anything on the screens. Staff unhelpful and I never saw one of them smile. The man beside me (mistakenly) asked to purchase some cheese and crackers. The attendant literally threw a menu at him and hissed that they didn't have cheese and crackers. The seats were painfully thin and I could not get comfortable even in the Exit row isle. The only bonus you got a full can of pop although I asked for ginger ale and they didn't have any. Service only came through once and people were all complaining that they were parched and would like water.
4410,Booked on a Sunday morning flight from Miami to New York. Arrived at 6.50 for an 8.10am flight. There must have been 10 lines along a large expanse of the terminal. We were misdirected 4 times to the wrong line. The lines were 4 layers thick and moved incredibly slowly. We stood on one line for 40 minutes before we began to fear we would miss our flight because of the slow pace of check in. The American line attendants were unhelpful. They suggested self- check in but I explained that I had a dog. He then told me I was in the wrong line. The correct line was equally long and I missed my flight. I will never travel AA again. There are other choices between Miami and NY and AA is not less expensive.
4411,Flew from Philadelphia to Dublin old plane unfriendly staff - one screen for 50 people and 1 movie in 5 hours. Pasta and bread tasted the same and fixed recline for seats. Unsatisfactory! Will switch to another airline next time.
4412,June 22/23 were 859 and 5859 from CVG to PIE. After experiencing 7 delays plus a total cancellation of our flight on June 22 this is the bottom line (according to me). Allegiant is simply unable to accommodate delays (weather/mechanical) flight crew timing out or what have you. The fleet is very small so they cannot put you on another flight like the other big carriers can nor do they have contracts with other airlines to re-book you and get you on your way. After the headaches disappointment worry and trouble I went through for my trip the savings was just not worth it. Its not to say that Delta does not experience issues they do they are just better able to accommodate and/or offer options.
4413,My daughter's Flight 150 scheduled to leave Mesa AZ to Missoula MT on July 5 2014 at 7.40am finally left at 4pm and only made it to Idaho Falls. Bus transported passengers who did not want to wait until July 6 at 12.40 pm to take flight to Missoula. Bus arrived in Missoula around 1 am praying flight back will be uneventful. Please give staff more training in being courteous to inconvenienced travelers.
4414,People are getting bigger not smaller. The seats were uncomfortably tight and small. Entertainment terrible can't they put on a recent movie. Not even a cookie was served! The airline attendants were stone faced. When leaving the plane no attendants present. This is the worst airline we have been on. We will never use it again even if it is cheaper. Flights both going and coming were 45 min to 1 hr delayed. We almost missed our connecting flights both times we were the last to board the plane with rude comments from workers that they are waiting for us!
4415,All four of my flight legs were substantially delayed (one because they couldn't find one of the crew members). The airline took no responsibility for the delays-they did not have enough gate agents did not accommodate passengers who missed connecting flights or were trapped in airports overnight as a result of the delays and were extremely rude to passengers who asked for compensation. The seats were also very tight and I could not fit a normal sized backpack fully under the seat in front of me.
4416,July 5th flight 101 Cedar Rapids to Phoenix-Mesa. It's very nice that once you get on the plane you know you won't have to worry about connecting flights and the seats are fairly comfortable. However the airline is almost never on time. Today's (I mean tomorrow's because it left after midnight) was over 3 hours late and it wasn't weather related. I'm also getting the impression they really don't care if they're late because they know they don't have to worry about connecting flights. I used to balance the inconvenience with the cheaper cost but now with all the extras you have to pay they really aren't much cheaper than the major airlines and they sure are a lot less reliable. I used to seek out Allegiant flights. I think now I'm going to try to avoid them. Too bad.
4417,Very poor long haul experience with American Airlines. Aircraft was ancient with one TV per 6 rows; wording on screens was illegible if sat at the side. Food was in edible. Crew failed to conduct a full cabin secure check with many hazards going unnoticed. Will not be flying American again.
4418,We paid a premium for a flight from Albuquerque to Orlando getting in at 5pm. As it turned out we could have arrived earlier on the cheaper flight with another carrier. We were delayed as always when flying AA. Eventually got in over 3 hours late. Asked for some level of compensation for getting in late even though we paid a premium for this particular schedule. Received an email saying we won't be giving any compensation and of course could not reply to the email. Sadly I will no longer fly this carrier. It has just been too many problems delays etc.
4419,Travelled from Miami to London on January 8th 2015 in first class. Very bad service and very shabby cabin. Here's a warning. Our meal was extremely disappointing it was cold and when we complained the meals were taken away and re-heated not safe. Also and worse still was my wife's meal. She needs Gluten Free food but her meal was terrible some chicken and rice which again was cold. When my wife made comments to the senior steward she told us that due to AA cutbacks they are withdrawing special meals. This was not denied by AA customer relations so if you have any kind of special dietary needs do not fly AA. Be warned.
4420,AA from BOS to MIA on Jan 26 (rather than on the 28th to avoid the storm) next in business MIA to Santiago Chile on the 28th as scheduled. Returned in economy Montevideo Uruguay on Feb 10 to MIA (rather than on the 11th to avoid a predicted storm). Finally on to BOS in first on February 12. I wish the in-the-air product always equalled the consistently excellent service we receive at the Platinum desk. Based on three of the four flights we found the experience professional. The flight however from Montevideo to Miami was characterized by perfunctory service with the crew basically invisible expect for the required meal service. When we boarded they were clustered together laughing. No assistance in boarding the very full plane and throughout the flight. AA has a lock on this flight; should do better. Primitive inflight system not working. Ratings below based on MVD-MIA flight not the other three which were fine.
4421,JFK to GIG on Nov 21st and return on November 30 from GIG to JFK. Flying business class all over the world with different airlines. They are by far the worst that I have experienced. Lousy old planes broken seats and tray tables entertainment system consists of ipads horrible food and drinks selections (half of what is on the menu not available). They are known to cancel flights for mechanical failures. The crew were nice and were aware of their company's issues.
4422,LAX-DFW-MEX and return - First/Business Class. My expectations were set fairly low as these were my 11th and 12th transit of DFW on American over the last 6-7 years but wanted to burn off some miles. Of these trips I can now say that 2 have departed on time out of this place. That said my trip down to MEX was uneventful. Food was fair at best and F/A's smiles seemed missing but was on time. The departure out of MEX back to Dallas was delayed by Radar problems at MEX. This set off a chain of events that resulted in a missed connection at DFW and while 90% could be attributed to the Radar problem. The flight was not posted on airport monitors and the gate was changed. The departure gate did not have the flight displayed so people had to ask if this was indeed for the DFW flight. Once on board the pilot announced a 59 minute traffic delay due to an early full ground stop. That 59 minutes went by plus another 20 or so with no further word from the crew. Late passengers arrived about an hour after the scheduled time and once loaded the door was shut and we pushed back. Since I signed up for Emails I received no fewer than 14 Emails that I didn't read until arrival in DFW which caused connection confusion that even one of their agents could not explain. As it turned out due to carry on bag only I could have made my first flight but apparently they gave my seat away thinking there would be no way I could make it. Coming into DFW I checked online and it showed what looked like I had been rebooked on the 2nd of 2 remaining flights but Emails after arrival which were generic made me think I had been rebooked on the first of the two. All 3 remaining flights were at different terminals which didn't help. Food offered on both return legs was ridiculous same thing on both flights which means they boarded the little biscuit sandwiches at DFW flew them to MEX to serve on the return flight.
4423,Flew from Provo Utah for my honeymoon. We got a good price but in all honesty we're more than willing now to travel the 60 minutes to Salt Lake to fly on any other airline for a little higher price. The comfort of the seats on the Allegiant flights was horrendous and the service staff was cold and ironically un-serviceable. Our flight back from LAX was also delayed for no apparent reason but I got a text when we finally boarded that informed me my flight was delayed. Communication was horrible. Luckily my wife and I are a little more aware in airport situations; a couple sitting next to us thought they'd missed their flight because the marquee above our gate had changed and no announcement had been made about the delay. Very poor customer service. The hour and a half I save in driving time to our local airport is not worth what I lose out on with more professional airlines.
4424,"Terrible experience all around. Flight delayed three hours, no place to hang my dress uniform and generally terrible/confrontational service. If these people spent half the time they do berating customers actually doing their jobs correctly maybe they wouldn't have such a terrible track record with customer service. If I have a choice next time I won't fly with them, I don't even care if it costs more."
4425,Travelling from Bogota to London via Miami we lost our connecting flight at Miami Airport due to delay of our first flight with American Airlines. We waited 5 hrs in a long queue with other passengers that have also lost connecting flights with AA. AA staff was really impolite. Their only offer was to travel to Dallas next day and from there to London. They didn't offer accommodation and we stayed all night at Miami Airport (12 hours) We finally reached London 24 hrs after our initially scheduled time. They didn't offer any kind of compensation. Never travel again with AA.
4426,I flew from Portsmouth NH to Punta Gorda FL in May on vacation with a friend. Everything about the flight itself was mostly fine. Free parking walk right in and check your bags with hardly any waiting. Security was quick and the flight was on time. They did have some computer glitches and thought it would be delayed however it was not. I did have two issues one was resolved the other was not. My TV screen did not work. They reset it 3 times and finally it worked. My biggest issue however was the return flight. 40 minutes from landing they put the seatbelt sign on with no warning. Then they absolutely refused to allow anyone to use the restroom. Several people tried to use the restroom and they made them sit back down and wait until landing.I will use Allegiant again because it was cheap and very convenient.
4427,JFK-Bermuda-JFK. Flight to Bermuda uneventful though only soft drinks served despite being an International flight at dinner hour nary a peanut to be seen. Seat comfort was reasonable for a 1 hr 37 min flight. One flight attendant was extraordinarily rude and sassy loudly scolding numerous passengers about a number of trumped up infractions. Return flight to JFK was overbooked so we and others were hauled into an American Airlines office told we would have to be rebooked the following day. After waiting a while with no further time left to clear customs American told us to be re-booked each passenger would have to pay an additional $298 above the flight ticket already paid plus a fine. American refused even to ask if other flights (Delta or Jet Blue) had space later that day when no one was willing to pay all the extra charges to re-book on American the following morning or even tell us where the other two airlines were located. As it turned out Delta had only Business Class seats available (they said) but Jet Blue could accommodate everyone for a charge of $198 per person. American is clearly not very customer friendly and one would think twice about flying with them again in the future. JetBlue as it turned out had more leg room served a snack and their crew onboard was much better organized and politer than American had been.
4428,AA0071 1/12/2015 FRA-DFW. Actually my flight was with Etihad however the connection from Frankfurt to Dallas Fort Worth was with American Airlines. The plane outside looked great however once I boarded it looked like I was still in the 1960's. Damaged/not working light switches ugly and dirty seats and the 12 hour long flight had no monitor to watch anything. I will try to avoid American Airlines in future.
4429,Flew from Greensboro NC to DFW. Flight was supposed to leave around 6 pm on 9/28. After waiting until after 8 we were told the lav was not working and we would be given vouchers and fly out at 7.30 the next morning. We were not helped to find transportation to our hotel although it was late on a Sunday evening and the airport was closing down. We finally got to our hotel at 9.45. Left the next morning at 6 but didn't take off until 8.30 - were told the bathroom issues were still not fixed and we would have to land in Memphis for people who needed a bathroom break. We were forced to deplane take all our luggage off then told there were hydraulic problems. We finally left Memphis after 1 and landed at DFW after 3. The people in Greensboro were not helpful nor did we ever feel that we were given accurate information about what was going on. A miserable experience.
4430,On 1/18 flew from Omaha to DFW to New Orleans. Flight very uneventful. Even arrived in Dallas early and had to wait for another plane to pull out so we had a gate to pull up to. Made the connection to New Orleans easily and the flight was on time. On 1/25 flew from New Orleans to DFW to Omaha. Flight was on time until we boarded in Dallas and wait to wait nearly an hour so light bulbs on the wing could be replaced. Since I don't fly much I was satisfied that the flights for the most part were on time and uneventful.
4431,GRB to HNL via ORD and DFW. Five of 6 segments were on time or up to 30 minutes early. Ground and cabin staff were personable passed beverages 4 times on long-haul outbound but service was very lean on return (no coffee on a flight arriving at 5 am). Cabins clean seats adequately cushioned but a tight fit as expected. The entree salad I purchased was tasty and priced fairly. Entertainment is really inadequate on B767-300 with overhead video and no music channels at all on return. Unfortunately American Eagle is really a hot mess except for nice cabin staff. On final segment five schedule changes were sent to my phone in a 30 minute period-30 minute delay no just 5 minutes back to 30 minutes etc. The final message indicated just a 5 minute delay but after we boarded we sat on the plane for another 50 minutes while they located a new captain anyway. In my experience if you must use American Eagle shoot for the first flight of the day.
4432,We used American for the first and last time 1/5/14 for a flight to Cabo (flight 1087). We had a transfer in Chicago that's where the nightmare began. We arrived 15 minutes early but had to wait for almost 1.5 hrs to get off the plane. The pilot said the gate was not clear yet because we were early then they were de-icing then the baggage handlers then crew problems. Our connecting flight was delayed an hour so we would just make it. The flight was scheduled for 10 am delayed until 11 but no gate given then 12 then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 then 6. We found out sometime after 2 that the plane was in Seattle. They never offered an apology although they did give us 12 dollar meal vouchers. We got 2 sandwiches and had to pay for our sodas. We were scheduled to be in Cabo at noon that day but did not get there until 10pm. A day of our vacation was lost 9 hours of aggravation and never offered any compensation for this terrible service. Just a quick comparison we went to Cancun in November on Southwest airlines they had a problem processing our boarding passes 20 minute delay we were afraid we were not going to be able to go but they got the problem fixed. If you have a choice for flights choose a company that cares.
4433,My daughter flew from Phoenix to MLI delayed to the next day . My wife flew from MLI to Phoenix / delayed 1.5 hr. My wife and I flew from Phoenix to MLI delayed 3.5 hrs. The flight to Duluth Minn had been scheduled for earlier that morning but the passengers were load and then deplaned. At 2.30 we were moved from our gate and the Duluth passengers were move to our gate and were loaded on our plane. That took about 1.5 hr. Once loaded the Duluth passengers were then deplaned again and told their flight had been cancelled. After they had been deplaned we were moved back to the gate we were originally scheduled for and finally loaded. This was 3.5 hrs after we were scheduled to take off for MLI. Now not only are the Duluth passengers angry but so are the return passengers waiting in Duluth. On top of that the MLI passenger are mad and so are the return passenger waiting in Moline which was originally scheduled for 8.30-9.00pm that evening. Unfortunately this is our only direct flight to Phoenix but no one should have to put with this kind of incompetence.
4434,Flight booked in Feb. for a vacation in July. We arrived early at airport and checked bags at 12.00 for a flight that was scheduled to board at 6.10 pm. Traveling with my 2 daughters. When we presented our boarding passing at 6.10 we were told the flight was overweight and we were selected to be removed. They did not ask if anyone on flight was willing to take a later flight. Just stated we were selected but not told how selection process works. Don't understand why they waited until we were ready to board. Had we been told 30 min earlier we could have caught another flight that day. They would not remove our luggage or anyone elses to make weight. We were put on a flight the next day and had a layover (purchased flight was direct) arrived at final destination a day late and very grumpy. Our luggage did make it a day earlier. Find it hard to believe that they cut it so close that the weight of 2 average people (1 of us could have gone) makes the difference on flight. I would not fly with them again.
4435,"In spite of the fact that we booked and paid for a $4K vacation a month before the actual travel AA wouldn't assign my husband and I actual seats. This meant we couldn't print out boarding passes before getting to the airport. However if we were willing to pay extra $ they would give us seat assignments. In coach. They were basically holding the seats hostage unless we paid a ransom to free them. When I enquired w/ AA as to why they actually said that our $4K payment gave us the ""service"" of flight/flying not the actual seat. They also said seat assignments were handled by the gate. An out and out lie since an extra $60 or more would have gotten us seat assignments on the spot."
4436,"Flew from Seattle to Santiago via Miami. The flight to Miami was uneventful on a 737. The flight to Santiago left much to be desired on an antique 767. Seats were uncomfortable and stained. The meal was bland and unappetizing to look at - made the mistake of having the chicken. The old school ""entertainment"" system was a throwback to the 70's and the movie was only available in Spanish. It was a moot point though as I could not see the 12"" screen from a dozen seats away anyhow. The return flight was canceled. We were rebooked the next day on a 777 which was a welcome change. Unfortunately this plane was filthy and the FAs were quite rude. To cap it off as we were boarding we were stopped on the jetway and told that AA has a no outside drinks policy so we would have to throw out the bottles of water we bought airside before boarding our 10 hour flight. On the plane I timed it and after the original thimble of water it took 5 hours to get another one. I learned my lesson and AA will not get my business again."
4437,"As the saying goes ""You get what you pay for"". Cheap flight was great. However do not purchase the shuttle from Allegiant directly as an add on. Book one yourself directly through a shuttle service. If you have any issues and try to call someone for help from Allegiant they will not assist you - they direct you to fill out an online form. And then the email response you receive will not even make sense. The service agent from the call center was rude to myself and the Resort Manager. They would not connect us to the customer service dept or their manager for help. Because of the horrible customer service that will be the last time I book anything through this company."
4438,"Left Sanford/Orlando May 5 2014 heading to South Bend IN at check in told clerk I never selected at seat when booking but was charged $48.00 for going and coming back she was very hateful and told me I was charged and had to sit in the seat I picked. I explained to clerk I could not sit in an aisle seat I always traveled with a window seat and she tells me ""That's tough are you going to fly or not"". I didn't get that so called assigned seat after all but it was an aisle seat due to a to switch of planes for some reason but still charge for the seat. I had things in my one piece of luggage that would not be returning with me coming home so luggage would be lighter - when checking back in to go home I was 4 pounds overweight with less things. When boarding I was told to sit in row 31 and not 25 and got a window seat this time but paid for another seat - the man sitting in my so called paid seat refused to move."
4439,We got stranded at Chicago O'Hare due to a missed connecting flight because the incoming flight was 2.5 hours late. We were very tired after a full day of travel and met with stony faced unsympathetic staff at American Eagle Counter at Gate G7. After telling us we would have to spend the night waiting for the next morning flight we were given the bogus reason of weather delay and sent to AA Counter since we were told it was up to AA to handle our case. There were 2 staff personnel dealing with 2 customers and none would agree to accompany us to the AA Counter. It all ended badly with arguments the weather was nice departing in West Palm Beach FL and it was cloudy upon arrival in Chicago - nonetheless our flight came in 2 hours late. We started our day at 9pm in LAX and ended up at that time at 10pm at American Eagle Counter at ORD.
4440,Flight 1021 on January 24 from Granada to Miami. This was a terribly crowded and hot plane. Flight duration was about 3 hrs 45 mins. The flight attendants made a single pass through the cabin to offer drink service and pick up cups which took no more than an hour and a half. After this they were not seen for the last 2 hrs 15 mins of the flight. I found three flight attendants seated at the rear of the plane. I have never had worse inflight service and had never seen a more lazy group of flight attendants.
4441,Booked flight and hotel with Travelbag and was horrified to discover that I was flying with AA! We flew economy from Heathrow to Miami Miami to San Jose. Check-in was good and we got good exit row seats on the first flight. Second flight we got bad seats and rude staff. Return journey again we got good exit row seats but had more bad staff does AA specialise in them? Not as bad as I thought but due to rude staff I won't be rushing to fly with them again.
4442,I constantly fly Allegiant round trips Sanford to Concord. Ever since they changed the times of this route from Monday and Friday morning to Mon/Fri evenings you can absolutely count on it being delayed 1 hour or more because it comes from Harrisburg PA. Please put back to Mon/Fri morning please.
4443,"Flight 287. Our Flight was supposed to be non-stop from Miami to LA. Plane developed a problem as we sat waiting to leave the terminal. It took 2 hours to determine it was not fixable. We were compensated with headsets and two granola bars while we waited for the news that American Airlines was trying to find another plane. No plane was available so we deplaned and waited another hour in the terminal for the decision to fly to Phoenix where we could refuel on the same plane and go on to LA. By now the flight is 4 hours late leaving. Arriving in Phoenix the captain said ""Good news is we are in Phoenix the bad news is the crew has to stand down due to FAA regulations."" Another delay - All the passengers were shuttled around to other flights. It's late we are all exhausted and had been lead along by a string of lies. We missed our connecting flight by 6 hours and had to stay in LA. Two granola bars and a pair of headsets. One lie leads to another creating distress for the passengers and the consequent employees that had to deal with the avalanche that resulted from a full-flight of unhappy flyers. It was a nightmare. I will never fly American again."
4444,DFW to Milan Italy via JFK in December 2014. On check in for this flight at DFW the agent informs us the flight is over sold in economy so we inquire about being switched to British Airways on the non-stop to LHR then on-wards to Milan. The AA Agent looks puzzled and quickly said we cannot switch you to BA. At this point we are confused as AA/BA have a tie up we know for a fact Delta can put you on Air France if the flight is over sold. So then we head to JFK with the domestic leg good on a new plane. At the AA terminal 8 at JFK we come to find out the AA lounge coupons given to use are no good but the AA Agent in the lounge makes an exception for the lounge since Christmas is around the corner. Finally we board the AA flight to Milan. Since we own the AA credit card we are allowed to board with Zone 2 but the red jacket agent stops us saying your AA Credit Card is useless and does not work for zone 2. Finally get on the flight and the flight leaves on time. Meals and service were good as AA has to compete with Emirates on this sector but AA really lacks any economy class in flight entertainment. There are no personal TV screens in each seat like Emirates offers. The seats in economy class are too small on AA. Since AA has put TV screens every few rows no one can sleep on this flight as the lighting from the TV screens is very annoying. To end the flight the Breakfast was very good in economy. Overall if AA would match Emirates with proper in flight offering in economy class they would have a good product but till they do this one is better offer taking Emirates if flying to Milan in Economy class.
4445,I have 2 children. One is 8 month and the other one 2.5 years. They don't give priority to board the plane to families with babies nor seniors. Secondly the staff who help you when you are checking in are useless. When you get to the airport you have to check in using their computers but if you are traveling with infants you have to line up for more than an hour. When we lined up an AA employee approached us and confirmed that we were in the right line. One hour later the staff member who was about to help us check in said that we were in the wrong line. Once at the gate they didn't give preference to families with babies. Somebody said through the speaker that there wasn't enough room for our carry-ons and that we had to check them in at no cost. When we approached the staff member at the front desk guy to ask him where to leave the carry on he ignored us. Lastly this airline charges you extra for your luggage. Our ticket was very expensive and on top of that we had to pay extra for our baggage. This is the first and last time that I travel with them.
4446,Find another airline to fly with. Sure the price is cheap but if anything goes wrong Allegiant does not do anything to help or compensate you. Our flight was delayed multiple times leaving us sitting in the airport for over 6 hours. Then after 6 hours of waiting Allegiant cancelled the flight. We received no compensation. Further when we arrived at the airport the next day we sat on the runway for an hour waiting to disembark and then another hour for our bags to come to the carousel. After sending an email to Allegiant expressing my frustration with the experience they offered no compensation or credit just a generic email that I had to wait 2 months for. Paying a more money for another airline is definitely worth it!
4447,I was on the red eye from LAX to IAH business (first) class: tiny canadair jet which is fine however it would be nice if it had been cleaned: the armrest still had food debris from the previous flight. I asked the flight attendant for a wet wipe which he provided by almost throwing it at me. Taking our orders by writing on a paper napkin? Never cracked a smile for the entire flight and in the end he was scolding some of us who dared standing up before he decided it was fine to do so so a gentleman in the front row who didn't stand reminded him that a please and thank you would have been appropriate and he replied that the crew orders must be obeyed at all times. The food was OK but nonetheless I cringed when I noticed that with the same tray he collected the dirty refreshing towels and then served tea and coffee. Seats were comfortable for the short flight.
4448,I try to avoid them whenever I can but as a student I have to go for the cheapest so I gave them another try from Miami to Milan. First of all no private screens on a 9 hour journey should be banned. Although I did sleep most of the time I would have liked to listen to some music or watch a movie of my choice not chosen by them. Besides that the aircraft didn't seem very well kept and the food was just bad. To make the matter worse the plane was delayed by 6 hours and they kept changing our gate telling the plane was broken. Would try to avoid them if you can.
4449,"Why is there always some ""breakdown"" with American? I live in Alexandria LA and only have three choices and unfortunately I am forced to fly AA. Normally only 1 out of 4 flight go without some type problem. Always late or delayed. Flight Crew doesn't show up. Gates are changed sometimes up to 5 times. And lost bags are the norm. Why can't AA get their game together?"
4450,In the air American was decent. We flew TUS-DFW-BNA and EVV-ORD-TUS and found the flight crew to be friendly and helpful for the most part. The issues we had were with customer service on the ground particularly in Dallas where our missed flight did not result in any support for our troubles. They also lost our luggage but they apologized and compensated us appropriately sending a check in a very timely manner. The MD-80s they fly are fine but the fact that I flew in a plane 5 years younger than me doesn't do much for my faith in the company. American Eagle's ERJs are horrible for anyone over 5 feet tall and they feel dated. The newer 737s were nice however.
4451,A short hop from Grand Rapids to O'Hare on an EMB140. Cramped interior with narrow seats and overhead lockers on one side only. Late departure and early arrival with a water service offered on the 40 min journey by a friendly cabin attendant.
4452,RDU-LGA/JFK-RDU in economy on American Eagle in an EMB 140. I am gold with Delta and never fly American; however I was satisfied with the customer service on the ground in all airports. However the in-flight experience was dreadful. Thank goodness I was only on the plane one hour otherwise these tiny ancient dirty decrepit airplanes would make anyone go crazy. The seats are narrow even on the single aisle side. The ceilings are very low possibly barely 6 feet or less. There is little or no overhead storage room so don't think about bringing an overnight case like you would on a normal plane. You will be forced to check them at the gate. FA's were fine as was the standard beverage service.
4453,Nov 10th AA2216. AA2463 Nov 11th. Our flight from LA to SYD was QF12 on Nov 11 2014. I would like to give American Airlines a poor review on their performance and customer service we experienced on a flight to Sydney Australia in November 2014. Our flight was delayed leaving MSP partially due to weather but really because they left us sitting on the plane while they delayed the de-icing and then took 45 minutes to do something the pilot said usually takes 15 minutes. We missed our connecting flight in DFW that was to take us to Sydney and the ticket attendants there absolutely refused to re-route us onto several flights that could have taken us to LAX to connect to a flight to SYD that same night. They instead put us on a flight the next day that would re-route us through LAX and on to SYD making us lose an entire day in Australia. The ticket attendants were rude and inconsiderate. I have never had such poor customer service in all my years of flying. DFW said it is a policy not to allow someone on a flight through stand-by if their end destination is international. American Airlines said each airport has their own policy on that and it is not a standard AA policy. There were several flights that went from DFW to LAX that evening and they allowed over 30 people to board those planes on stand-by but would not allow us to.
4454,"My experience with American Eagle is usually satisfactory. However on a return flight from Dallas to Waco on June 16 we were forced to change boarding gates ""five"" times. The flight was full so this group of people herded back and forth chasing gate changes for hours. The flight left 2 hours late. Not a pleasing experience. I am an AAdvantage customer and was not happy."
4455,I have never seen anything like I saw today at MIA. We arrived an hour and a half before my son's domestic flight and could not believe the chaos at American's ticket counters. There were long lines at every kiosk and even longer lines at the checked bag line. After finally checking in at a kiosk my son could not print his boarding pass because the machine had run out of paper. I had been standing in the checked bag line and when we approached the employee and explained that we had a luggage tag but the boarding pass had not printed she directed us to another line that had easily more than 60 people! I then approached another American Airlines employee and asked for assistance and she was incredibly rude and offered no help. Fortunately we were able to get my son's boarding pass on the phone. Despite a ridiculous security check-in line he was able to board his flight on time. A friend of his that was on the same flight had to forcefully argue with other employees to get on the flight because they said they had closed the gate and would not let him board even though he was checked in!
4456,"Bought ticket online in February also paying for seats and a checked bag. Later I added another bag and found on the itinerary that one seat was ""not assigned"". Tried to phone customer service but too long wait. On check-in at GRR I learned that the aircraft had changed thus deleting that seat. This got resolved by agent. But it caused me some confusion and time trying to resolve. Allegiant website not user friendly. I chose Allegiant because of convenience of departure and arrival airports and the times. But in general we were not impressed by the service. Don't know if we saved versus another airline. Will compare next time."
4457,Last January 13th I took my flight back from Madrid Spain to JFK AA 095 we started our flight two hours late not being informed about time or anything similar we were not allowed to leave the area inside the airport where our plane was and if we wanted they said that they would open our carry-on bags totally. We boarded and when we were boarding they informed us that we had a stop in Goose bay Canada to have gas otherwise we would not be able to get to New York the stop was 1h 30m long. We arrive in JFK so late that almost everybody lost their connection. However we were given new connections once we got out of the plane. But they did not give us any voucher or anything in compensation for this horrible flight. I would try not to fly American Airlines again.
4458,Flight Miami to LHR 13/01. Technically the flight was good early arrival very soft touchdown and excellent information from flight deck. However the cabin service left a lot to be desired. The crew were very unhelpful and the food poor by the standards of comparable airlines. Our return trip to the UK (operated by AA) was far inferior to our outward trip to Boston operated by BA. Given the choice at a comparable price level I would not fly with AA again.
4459,"KIX to HKG. Our flight was delayed for 6.5 hours. The ground staff were unprofessional dealing with the delay and told us there was nothing they could do. Before they cancelled the flight, they had us wait at the gate for an hour.  The meals were poor, plane was old and IFE outdated and kept freezing. ANA product on the SE Asian routes is really poor and needs work. On our return flight, the plane was super hot when we boarded - like a heated room, and again an old 767 with poor IFE and untasty meals."
4460,SIN-NRT on ANA 802 - economy - I selected this company as it was a 5 stars airline. I was disappointed. The economy seat is really uncomfortable (on 777-300). Difficult to believe they give 34 inches space. Deception with the breakfast too. But the service was perfect.
4461,My husband and I fly with Allegiant very often but the past 4 or 5 times it has been delayed. I flew from Lexington to Orlando/Sanford on April 6 and the flight was delayed twice. The first time said it would be delayed by an hour and I thought ok I can deal with that. Then a couple hours later I received a text from Allegiant saying it was basically delayed by hours. Now keep in mind I paid more for a ticket to come in at an earlier time because my house is 2 hours away. We actually got in later than it I had paid for the cheaper ticket. I used to really like Allegiant but now I am wondering if I want to continue to fly with them or not. We usually fly at least 10 to 15 times a year.
4462,Flight was delayed each way. Rude service. The flight attendant literally told one lady not to take too long to put her bag away in the overhead. The flight is cheap but they add on charges for everything. I guess you get what you pay for.
4463,Itinerary: Chicago - Miami - Campinas Brasil. Flight from MIA to VRP was canceled because the AA crew did not show up. Service crew for the make-up flight were very nice and accommodating but the AA staff at MIA were not very friendly at all and we had to search for them after seeing our flight was canceled. On all legs the planes were AA and not very clean at all. Overall I lost a couple days traveling and when I arrived I felt dirtier than when I have flown better international carriers not to mention no personalized inflight entertainment or WiFi. Two thumbs down for international AA.
4464,"I recently flew from Brazil to Los Angeles on American Airlines and it was the longest most uncomfortable international flight I have ever been on. In addition to the dirty looking and old interior the broken flush button on the toilet and the only semi-functioning ""entertainment"" device the staff were rude and had horrible attitudes. One flight attendant actually rolled her eyes at me when I asked for headphones. Her response was ""Don't you have an iPod or something that you have headphones for"". When I said no she rolled her eyes and said she would see if they had any but everyone brings their own headphones now. The food was horrible as well. It was the most unpleasant flying experience I have ever had. I will avoid flying American Airlines at all costs in the future."
4465,HND - OKA economy 24 May 2015 NH479. The flight was OK. Seats are OK with reasonable amount of leg room. No food was served only a drink (and limited selection was available). Cabin crew was very attentive and friendly. Flight was delayed by 20 minutes but at boarding only a 5 mins delay was announced. Flight entertainment system consisted of large screens on which a video was shown for the first half an hour. It remained blank for the rest of the journey. the plane (I believe it was a 777) was quite noisy.
4466,Our second trip travelling with Allegiant and for the most part we are happy with our flights to first Hawaii and now San Diego. However travelling from San Diego on April 20 we were concerned with the lack of communication about gate location. Since we printed the boarding passes the night before we expected no firm boarding gate at that time. When we arrived at the airport without checked in baggage we went directly through security as we usually do. However past security on the airport monitors there was no reference to our flight at all. All other airlines had the gate and time of departure clearly listed. We walked the airports 40 plus gates looking for any indication of which gate we should depart from. We then asked airport staff and they could only suggest we find an Allegiant agent which we could not. Again all other airlines were clearly provided with gate and departure time but not Allegiant. Finally we called Allegiant customer service and were on hold for 30 minutes. The person we finally talked to was after some delay was able to provide a preliminary gate assignment but suggested it might change. When we finally did find it even the monitor at the gate indicated gate closed. Rather than relaxing before our flight the time past security was quite stressful and at time we wondered whether we were at the right terminal. Communication is very important to passengers. All it would likely taken was a quick call the airport staff to get the monitor situation corrected. We will fly Allegiant again.
4467,JFK-YUL flying an Embraer 1x2 rows. Using American airline JFK flagship lounge it is probably the best American lounge. I have been told I must go to gate at 8.50 for 9.30 flight. Well I was there by 8.30 pm waited until 9.15 pm I have been told the flight delay because crew is not on board. Another 30 minutes I walked to the counter again and I have been told engineers are on board fixing problems. By 10.45 pm I went to the counter again and I have been told there is another plane will arrive in 10 minutes and they will change aircraft. 11pm the pilots walked out the arrived plane and ready to go home. Half way the terminal one ground staff called them back and after some phone calls pilots back on the plane again. 11.20 boarding started 11.45 took off at JFK. Cabin crew only did safety demo and hand out landing card. No drinks or anything served. Pilot just said try to get to Montreal as fast as he can. We landed at YUL 1am. From the beginning to the end not one person apologised for the delay. I will try to avoid this airline in the future.
4468,Miami to Atlanta flying an Embraer. 1x2 rows. No storage for carry on inside the plane. They made us walk thru the rain to board the aircraft. The flight took off more than an hour late. Price was USD350 but they don't even give a full can of coke. I tried to purchase a snack but they don't accept my American Airlines credit card. Very uncomfortable seat. I would avoid American eagle in my future flights.
4469,New York to San Francisco 20 Dec 2014 AA179. San Francisco to Los Angeles 25 Dec 2014 AA2378. Los Angeles to Las Vegas 30 Dec 2014 AA182. Las Vegas to New York 4 Jan 2015 AA120. My partner and I were extremely disappointed with everything. All 4 flights were delayed not by few minutes but by hours. Later the staff would board all passengers on to the aircraft and in all the flights we would just sit on the tarmac for hours. Usually when you board the plane the CSD or the purser of the flight would greet you with a friendly smile and say welcome aboard or good morning etc. But in all the flights with AA they could not care less about passengers. Flight attendants were too busy talking to each other or. The grooming of the flight attendants was atrocious! Above all the flight attendants on all 4 flights were very rude and arrogant. They don't even bother to look or smile or talk politely with the passengers when they are boarding the flight. The seats in economy was so uncomfortable with minimal leg room. There is no comfort. It is okay for short flights but not very good for long flights like New York to San Francisco or Las Vegas to New York. We paid extra for extra legroom economy seats. Well AA should learn what extra legroom means. There was no extra legroom. The seats are terrible for tall people. I will never recommend AA.
4470,LAX-SLC on 18 July 2014 SLC-RDU on 25 July 2014 RDU-JFK on 28 July 2014. Typical AA flights and lounges- pretty ordinary. Not a patch on Qantas or BA. Ground staff at RDU did not recognise or acknowledge an international RTW J class ticket - denied baggage allowance. Had to pay $25 to check 1 bag. Why don't AA enforce carry-on bag rules? Many passengers with 3 or more overweight bags. Would we recommend AA to family & friends? Probably as they are 'less bad' than the opposition.
4471,LHR-NRT business 23/5/15. The cabin was pleasant and well arranged. Seats allow for flat lying during the night and are provided with an additional mattress that can be used to minimise the seat joints. Seats were generally very comfortable with plenty of space in the feet area. Food was generally good and with a nice selection (I got a steak). Cabin crew were attentive and discrete. The only drawback I found was the noisy airplane: if you are used to travel on a Dreamliner or an A380 or A340 you will find the 777 extremely noisy (even with the noise cancellation headphones). Entertainment was OK although variety was limited. After few flights I managed to watch most of the movies. Lounge in Heathrow before flight (United) was fabulous.
4472,"Friendly service - I checked in only an hour before departure and the check-in lady gave me a bulkhead seat for legroom. I also fell asleep during meal service but the stewardess came by when I woke up and offered me the meal. They were endlessly smiling when serving too. Aircraft was new 787 and I did feel less dry through the flight as they say - not too thirsty. Food was 2 meals dinner and breakfast - quality only OK but quite plentiful - miso soup main meat and veg plus noodles then fruit salad. They also brought round a hot flannel when waking before breakfast which was great. Entertainment was ok - around 30 films slightly clunky and old AFE around 8"" capacitive touchscreen. Enough choice for the flight. Also USB and laptop power."
4473,DCA-JFK-DCA CRJ 700. High marks for operating on a forecast heavy snow day when many other airlines cancelled. Weather turned out to be fairly mild at both DCA and JFK that day. This is commuter regional service and works well only for a flight of no longer than 1.5 hours each way (approx. 250 miles). I connected at JFK to a Cathay Pacific international flight. CRJ 700 aircraft on both segments were quite new very quiet clean and reasonably comfortable in First Class. Yet the so-called First Class seat offers nothing with no leg rest or entertainment system. All standard carry-on bags must be valet checked and causes delays at the destination especially if connecting quickly to another flight. A beverage was served and a small bag of trail mix was given outbound but only given to me on the inbound flight because I asked. American Eagle gate counters tend to be a bit chaotic especially at JFK as several flights board from the same gate entrance. Both flights were on time the flight attendants were reasonably friendly and my checked luggage delivered without too much delay. Overall this is the most basic way to connect by air (even in so-called First Class) between two airports that are about 250 miles apart. On this trip the flights worked very efficiently for that purpose only. I would not want to fly on a commuter regional jet for a longer trip.
4474,SAN-ORD-ROC and BUF-ORD-SAN. I decided to fly paid first as the cost when booking only a few weeks out was only slightly more than economy. I've flown AA first domestically many times so didn't expect much but flying so early in the morning it was nice to have a slightly larger seat to sleep. I'm only writing this review to point out what a drastic turn for the worse after the merger. The food quality while on domestic F is never great has always been better than the rest on AA. It is now absolutely disgusting. The one positive is that first is now offered on American Eagle - a very minor improvement of course for a flight so short in duration. I really hope management wakes up and realizes that they are ruining what was a much better than average airline.
4475,New revised economy's seating arrangement on ANA's 777-300 ER was a big disappointment. Flew on NH 0007 on May 18 continued on NH 835 on 787 on May 19 after 2.45 transit time. The first flight SFO-NRT was a miserable 10+ hours flight. I didn't expect to see 3x4x3 on a 77W seat plan especially from a 5 star airlines. Food was great and cabin crew were attentive but couldn't make up for the awkward seating arrangement. The second flight was on a 787 with a generous 2+4+2 it was a much better flight and I hope ANA will keep the seating arrangement on a 7+ hrs flight.
4476,We flew Toledo to Sanford Feb 6th. Since we were the only flight going out that morning we breezed through security. Boarded the plane and sat. Finally the captain came on and explained we had to wait for the fuel truck to come back because we had not received enough fuel. Then we sat waiting for the paperwork. We finally took off 45 min. late not making up any time in the air. When we approached Sanford the captain came on again to inform us we now had to much fuel and would be circling the airport until we burned it off. 45 mins later we landed. All this plane does is fly back and forth between Toledo and Sanford. You'd think the fuel people would know exactly how much fuel is needed for each trip.
4477,I got delayed for a day in Dallas-Ft. Worth due to snow there on a Phoenix to Kansas trip. Granted it was Christmas Day and employees could have been short-handed but frankly American seemed quite unprepared to deal with the chaos and re-scheduling necessities that ensued. Customers were obliged to wait in long lines to re-schedule with few ticketing or gate agents to assist them. Next day was worse with no more employees in sight to handle the customers. Gate staff were swamped and customers departing to different destinations were on top of one another at the same gate awaiting delayed flights. Fortunately I encountered helpful American Airlines and airport staff that humanized the experience and assisted me.
4478,I just flew on a Milan-Miami route with AA and thought the interior was extremely run down and dirty. No personal TV's poor choice of 2 films for a 10 hour flight cheap headsets dirty and broken toilets and disgusting food. My kids flew over thanksgiving one from Dallas to Madrid and another from JFK to Milan and the plane conditions were the same. Will never fly again AA on International flights!
4479,"NRT/ORD 777-300 I hesitated booking F/class on AA even with award travel because of their flight attendants' general culture of hostility towards passengers but I reasoned I'd be asleep for much of the flight. We sat on the tarmac for 45 minutes before taking off. When returning to my seat from the lavatory after we'd finally reached cruising altitude a flight attendant looked at me coldly and barked ""Put your seat belt on!"". There was some turbulence but this was not the way to handle it. The purser was friendly and efficient but he referred to my husband as ""Mr.---- "" and called me ""Dear"". The new seats were very comfortable though and I liked that my husband and I could spin the seats to face each other while dining (although the food was surprisingly bad). I slept well on the comfortable flat bed. If the food and service were comparable to the seat it would have been a great flight. Until then I'll continue to book transpacific premium travel on Asian carriers."
4480,"NH171 SJC-NRT. NH827 NRT-DEL. NH828 DEL-NRT. NH172 NRT-SJC. Not sure how this airline got so many positive reviews. I flew round-trip from San Jose to New Delhi and this was by far the worst experience. The seats are so uncomfortable that 9 hour feels like forever. The quality and quantity of meal is below standard. I had a funny incident where flight crew offered me Ice cream and immediately took is back saying ""sorry this ice cream is not part of your special meal"". The IFE was a joke. Just few movies in each category. If you have other options avoid this airline. forget all that Dreamliner experience I bet you will crave for comfort!"
4481,"RT from MLI to LEX involving connection at ORD each way. I have been flying for 45 years - this is without question the worst possible round-trip experience I have had. We were 90 minutes late leaving MLI (first flight of the morning) due to problems with a thrust reverser. Had a 45 minute wait. Overheard the pilot tell another passenger what the problem was - why was there never an announcement to the rest of the passengers? As a result we arrived ORD 15 min too late to make the connection. Next flight to LEX was 6 hours later and was sold out - next possible seats were 9 hours later. American did agree to let us travel to Louisville (SDF) instead but had to rent a car with a hefty drop charge. Finally arrived in Lexington 3.5 hours later than planned. Return trip a few days later was worse - left LEX and arrived ORD on time. Had a 2.5 hour layover. The time came to board with no announcement. 30 minutes later told the aircraft had landed and we would board ""shortly"". Another 30 minutes passed and the gate was changed requiring a hike down the concourse. Finally boarded 2.5 hours after original departure time. Clearly there were mechanical issues at work and AA does not want to admit to them. I would avoid this airline completely in the future but unfortunately their competition is equally indifferent to passengers and equally incompetent."
4482,IAH to LAX. This was a pretty standard flight. The plane was small and the seats were uncomfortable feels like taking the bus but for a short flight it is hard to complain too much. The plane was a commuter with 2 sets on 1 side of the aisle and 1 on the other. I am 6'5 so my knees constantly dug into the seat in front of me and turbulence was painful like most economy class seats. The service staff was among some of the most friendly I have seen on a domestic airline but I'm sure that it varies from flight to flight. Captain displayed good communication with the passengers. Offered the usual non-alcoholic drinks in a small cup. I can't give any airline a good ranking on food and beverage that will charge for a bag of crackers. The flight departed and arrived on time however at LAX American Eagle crams you into a shuttle shoulder to shoulder to go to the main terminals. Overall not a bad experience and I will probably use them next time I fly to LAX.
4483,"I dread flying with American Airlines but with their association with British Airways (Who are fantastic) I have to for internal American Flights. Last flight was from Boston to New York with an onward BA connection to London. Arrived at Boston airport for check in very rude AA check in attendant who was unhelpful and just plain miserable. Onwards to the departure gate screens indicated a 25 minute delay. Was not too concerned as had around 4 hours to connect onto BA flight once landed in JFK. We then spent 2.5 hours waiting at the gate with hardly any communication from AA staff apart from ""Its a weather delay"" turns out it was due to a faulty aircraft door. Anyway the four hour connection time was fast approaching and people were starting to become annoyed and very irritated. Finally ushered onto the aircraft at speed as we only had a window of 25 minutes to board and be airborne if not flight would be cancelled as the crew would be out of hours. We boarded the aircraft and took off with around 4 minutes to spare. Seatbelt signs stayed on for the whole flight and apparently due to adverse weather the crew would also remain seated so no food or drinks would be served. I have honestly never been on an AA flight whereby the crew are smiling happy to serve you and are actually grateful for you flying with them and I have taken around 8 AA flights including across the pond the attitude at times is appalling. On the same holiday I was on a delayed Delta flight from Atlanta to Boston and the difference between staff was unbelievable was even given a free beer and sincere apology for the delay and more importantly was kept informed and the crew were cheerful and happy. AA manners cost nothing!"
4484,"I am a long time traveler and loyal to American Airlines however whoever designed these ""new"" planes must have been 2 feet tall. The design is terrible. I am a slim 5'10"" and sat in a ""premium"" economy seat from Washington DC/LA on a nearly 6 hour flight. I sat next to two other tall people making it even more unpleasant. I will start with the good American has finally come into the 21st century and provides individual screens for in flight entertainment but still not nearly as good as Virgin America which also offers many free viewing options TV etc. Chargers USB are improved as well. Now the bad - the leg room and more so the seat/tray table configuration (even in premium) is appalling and even worse if the person in front of you reclines their seat which is highly likely. In my case they did and my drink ended up in my lap. If the seat in front is reclined you are pretty much trapped. The head rest ""wings"" that allow you to rest your head from side to side are so small anyone with a normal size head could not possibly use. They are ridiculous. The seat pocket basically holds nothing forget stocking up on magazines and books for your long flight as you will be carrying them in your lap or chucking them on the floor. Though it's nice to fly in a nicer and newer plane it is just shocking that no consideration was given to traveler comfort on these new planes especially if you are a over 5'2"". Not sure how the American or Boeing CEOs didn't catch this. They must have only tested out first class or they are all really short!"
4485,MUC-HND 2 April. HND-MUC 18 April Economy. Responsive and friendly staff and nice food. However the legroom was extremely tight the worst I have ever experienced on long haul. And this on the new B787 Dreamliner. Would definitely avoid this airline in the future.
4486,I fly American Eagle a couple of times a month on business. The flights are almost always on-time. My only real complaint is the condition of the fleet - they really need to update their planes. The planes are incredibly cramped the seats are hard the storage is non-existent some wi-fi would be great for us business travelers. It's confusing that they accept only cash on board for alcohol/snacks when with most other carriers (including AA) it's the other way around. Still it's much better than UA Express to name one other regional carrier I've flown with recently.
4487,Four flights. First and second leg out were fine no problems and on time. Return to Dallas on third leg was also good. Last leg home out of Dallas was to board at 5pm Waiting at gate after 5 and agent announced that the flight crew was late. Captain arrived about 5.15 but no Flight Attendant or First Officer. Substitute FA obtained and was told about 5.30 that FO was due shortly. 6pm still no FO but Captain had us board. Sat in hot plane (101 degrees outside) but FA did distribute water. Captain left cockpit returned around 7 pm and told us to leave the plane as he did not know when the FO would get there. 7.15 substitute FO arrived we re-boarded and lifted off from the runway around 7.40 arriving at our destination around 8.30pm. Plane had to wait for ground crew to finish with a Chicago arrival before we could get to the gate. Off the plane at 8.50.
4488,Arrived in Nashville from Miami. Frustrating how much bad service they cram into such a short flight. When we got to our gate we were informed without apology that the gate had been changed. Once onboard it was apparent that we would be served with the same lack of professionalism. Having boarded 20 minutes late the pilot made up the time. My wife fell asleep but condensation from the air unit above started dripping on her. The seat front pocket was torn so badly that their included magazines kept spilling out onto the floor. After de-boarding those with gate checked luggage had to line up in the hall and wait for them. I was pleased that mine was second because it turned out that nearly everyone had a gate checked luggage thanks to more or less standard baggage fees. This made for a very messy de-planing. This is a time when companies like American Eagle should be attempting to compensate for their less maintained appearance by upping the ante on customer service. Sadly they are moving in the opposite direction.
4489,AA174 (Raleigh RDU-London LHR) on Dec 23 2014. We initially boarded the old rust bucket that is the 767-300 only to be disembarked a couple of hours later due to mechanical problems. They told us mechanics would have the problem fixed in 2 hours only for the inevitable announcement 3 hours later that they couldn't fix the plane and that we would depart the next morning. AA did provide hotels overnight but it was another 2 hour ordeal with 250 passengers lining up to see ONE representative. The next morning we all made our way to the gate boarded the same plane which the captain announced had been fixed and tested and waited for departure. Only we never departed. One hour later the captain announced the plane was STILL not fit to fly to the annoyance of us passengers. We had to wait a further 7 hours at the airport for another AA rust bucket 767 to come save us from London. After a 24 hour delay and 3 separate boardings for 1 flight we finally made it to London Christmas morning. My return flight (AA105) from London LHR to New York JFK operated on a brand new 777-300 was of course flawless. Lesson learned and tip: Do everything you can to avoid flying the 767 because chances are you won't be flying. They were good planes back in the 90's and 00's but they're unreliable these days. Moreover if you want entertainment and comfort avoid 767s at all costs. Ultimately AA is a good airline if you fly the right planes.
4490,"Dec 10 & 15 Economy flights - DCA to LAX & back. To LAX we were forced to sit row 11 even after we reserved ""main cabin upgrade"". Crew member informed us that the aircraft was switched. Then on the way back from LAX to DCA Dec 15 after paying extra for the upgrade ($81 for my husband's 11D & $78 for my 11E - Boarding Group 1 already included) I had to pay on top of that $15 each for Group 1 boarding - the website just did not allow me to proceed with on-line check in! Our multiple calls to Customer Service/their response were really unacceptable! E- mailed the AA Senior Leadership no courtesy response at all. Never again."
4491,DCA-JFK on an Embraer 140. Flight was on time. Airplane has seen much better days FA didn't really care about passengers but overall ok. For such a short flight I have no major complaints. Got me to my destination on time.
4492,January 1st Denver to Dallas Dallas to Wichita Falls. 5 hour delay in Dallas then canceled our flight. Told us no flights until Sunday/Monday refused to pay for food hotel rental and wouldn't give us our luggage. Ended up paying for my own hotel and splitting a rental with 3 other passengers. Luggage still in Dallas with no eta to get to me. 3 different calls to make a claim on luggage all three have said different information messed up my address each time and can't tell me why it wasn't delivered on next flight. Zero customer service. I will never fly AA again. I'll drive to Dallas and pay 3x as much to park my car to fly with anyone else.
4493,"BKK-HND on 787 cabin typically sterile in the interior design style that is an ""art form"" in Japan. Cabin service was abysmally slow - 1 hour and 40 minutes for drink and meal service to begin. No explanation given as to why there was a delay. Once completed the cabin service area became a hub for Duty Free dispensation for the remainder of the flight with staff arriving and departing from all directions through the Business Class cabin to take orders and deliver goods all of this at the expense of the well-being of Business Class passengers. Return flight HND to BKK on 787 was much better organised than the outbound catering-wise and there seemed to be none of the Duty Free bonanza sale to disturb the Business Class cabin. Overall rather disappointing for the reasons given and the lack of effective response to the issues raised. Check in at HND was slow with only 2 of 4 Business Class counters open at what must be their hub."
4494,SIN-HND and NRT-SIN while the overall service was good as usual but the seat is truly uncomfortable instead of normal design of reclining seat their seat is quite different that resulted in less frontal space!
4495,We flew from Las Vegas to Honolulu on March 27 2014. Flight to Honolulu had no problems or issues at all it was on time and everything went smoothly at the airport. Follow their luggage guidelines and check in online and you won't have any problems. Flight from Honolulu to Las Vegas was delayed 4 hours 15 minutes but they did give each person in my family $16 in food vouchers to use at the airport the problem was because of the delay we missed our shuttle from the Las Vegas airport to the parking garage where our car was. When I asked an Allegiant employee for some suggestions she just said I would have to get a taxi. When I checked in online 24 hours in advance for our flight home I was able to check everybody in except for myself (we had 10 people total). I tried to check myself in online a few hours later and it worked fine I just didn't get to sit by my family during the flight. There is no inflight movie so bring something to do. The seats are super small and there is not much room. No food or drink not even water is given unless you pay for it with visa only no cash. We got extremely affordable flights to Hawaii and otherwise would not have been able to go if it weren't for price Allegiant offered. You give up luxury and service for affordable pricing which I think is fair.
4496,DTW to ORD. ERJ 145s are a little claustrophobic for tall people. Good enough plane for the 52 mins flight to Chicago. Wouldn't care for a much longer flight on one though. Flight attendant was very cheerful.
4497,MIA-CLE a 3 hr flight on an ERJ 145. Very uncomfortable for the length of the flight and I am a small person. The only plus side was that being Executive Platinum I was offered free cocktails which was a nice gesture.
4498,On flight from Austin TX to Manchester UK on 12/21/14 - paid for the additional leg room which could be better but was ok however the seats are the most uncomfortable seats ever. The more leg room you get the narrower the seat gets! 8 hrs in a cramped seat is ridiculous. My husband and I had seats 15a & b and left the armrest up between us to give us room for our arms the passenger in seat c I am thankful to say did the same thing. Seriously removing rows of seats to gain additional leg room is one thing but reducing seat widths to cram in more seats is in my opinion the most ridiculous idea they ever had. The staff were not the best and a little on the rude side. I have flown AA every time I had flown to the UK but I am considering a different airline for future trips due to the seats mainly. The captain did a great job - the entire flight was smooth.
4499,I had to book a flight from Orlando to Manchester UK the day after Christmas for a family emergency so naturally looked for the most affordable flight which by a few dollars was AA also taking into account flight times. I have flown this route with many other airlines in the past and AA was by far my worst experience. Flight left 40 mins late but did make up the time with a tail wind so we arrived on time. Some of the cabin crew were downright surly others were very pleasant. As I can't sleep on planes I rely on watching movies to pass the time but with no in-seat screens there was nothing to watch. I will never fly AA again even if it saves me money.
4500,In all respects bar one my experience of flying with ANA was a perfectly adequate one. Both flights were taken in Business Class. The first was from Dusseldorf to Toyko Narita on a 787. The second was from Tokyo Haneda to London. In terms of cabin ambience seating and IFE both flights were fine. The ANA business class cabin interior feels a little sterile but the seats are comfortable with plenty of personal space and a decent sized IFE screen. The selection of IFE programming could have been more extensive but it was sufficient. Noise cancelling headphones were supplied on both flights. The amenity kit was also fine but didn't stand out. Cabin service was efficient but lacked finesse or genuine attention to detail. Serviceable is the best way I could describe it. The main issue however was the food. With both a Japanese and 'International' menu offered you might expect the latter to actually cater to an international clientele and on the outbound leg from Dusseldorf to Tokyo it did with an accessible selection of options appealing to a wide variety of tastes. However on the return journey departing from Haneda the ANA 'Connoiseurs' international menu was provided (along with the standard Japanese option). This offered an unappetising 'amuse bouche' involving bamboo shoots in apsic and herrings followed by an equally unappetising soyabean milk bavarois with sea urchin jellied asparagus and smoked scallops (all cold) with no other options available. Only the main course a combination of hamburger patty small piece of beef and egg plant in an unidentifiable sauce was even vaguely appealing. Unless you wanted 'tilefish' or a pasta option that sounded even less pleasant. I have no problem with airlines trying to make their food more interesting but when you have a captive audience stuck on-board for 12 hours trying to push the envelope with left-field combinations like soyabean milk bavarois and sea urchin is taking things too far. Especially when it is the only option. It might be something that would appeal to an adventurous diner in an expensive restaurant but not a tired hungry passenger on board a long flight where the food is being prepared in a small galley from pre- prepared ingredients. 30000 feet in the air is not the place for culinary experimentation. Add to that the fact that options for the second meal during what is a long flight were uninspiring to say the least (although more appetising and less avant garde) and for the first time in a long time I actually regretted not eating a proper meal before I boarded my flight. After 12 hours on board I arrived at my destination feeling pretty hungry. Was it enough to put me off flying ANA again. No but next time I will check the in-flight menu before departure and may stock up on snack food before I fly.
4501,I recently traveled from Bangor to Punta Gorda. Upon check in you are asked to pay extra money to sit in preferred seats unimpressed considering these are 20+ year old aircraft not worth the money. Flight was delayed leaving Bangor due to an issues with the APU. Flight Attendants were uninformative rather sloppy looking the male purser became annoying by always telling people that he was from Hawaii and kept making rude comments about other passengers hardly professional. Landed late into Punta Gorda no apology for the delay just more lip from that annoying purser surprised he didn't break out into another Hawaiian song just so annoy us. Will never take this awful carrier again.
4502,Flight AA900 EZE-MIA I traveled with my husband and we had window and alley seats but they are so very uncomfortable the leg space is almost non existent. The arm rests are very weird because that is where the entertainment control is so you put your arm on the control and it sets of constantly.
4503,I fly Bangor to Punta Gorda or Tampa/St Pete a lot. For what I save in cost I can't complain. However my attitude is that I am simply paying to get from point A to point B safely and on time - and at minimal cost. That always happens. I've had delayed flights on every airline I've ever flown - except Allegiant. That's simply a coincidence and it will surely happen eventually. It seems people can't wait to post bad news never the good. Allegiant specializes in low cost flights so don't compare them to airlines that hype about making your flight the highlight of your vacation. If you want to pay (a lot) extra for all the luxuries that's your choice - don't fly Allegiant.
4504,Gainesville to Miami non-stop. Gainesville airport is only serviced by three airlines so my choices were limited. Flight was OK a 64 seat ATR-72 showing its age but in decent shape. The flight was 1hr 20mins but we were still served drinks. American Eagle is good in that you can pick your seat when you book the ticket online unlike some airlines which charge you. A warning though the ATR-72 has overhead bins but they are too small for regular carry-on bags. Things like backpacks and purses will fit but that's about it. If you do have a standard luggage carry on you will check it in right before you get to the plane and once you get off the plane it'll be there waiting for you. The ATR-72 boards from the back of the plane so pick seats in the back and you'll be off the plane first.
4505,My family and I traveled down from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Los Cabos (SJD) and back for winter break. The first flight was not good. The seats were uncomfortable and the IFE (even though it was the ceiling types) were not working. All they gave was drinks and food was way over priced. This made a 4 hour flight seem like a 9 hour flight. There were no delays or problems with check-in. On the way back we were delayed a day but that was our choice. The same plane on the way back had a faulty fuel pump and could not be fixed at Cabo. So if they were to fly the aircraft was way overweight. The pilot announced that 20 people had to leave the aircraft or everyone could fly but only 40 baggage could be kept onboard. The flight was full so that would leave at least 200 people stranded in ORD. My family had no intention to fly a 4 hour flight with a faulty fuel pump so we exited the aircraft. Plus who wouldn't want an extra day in a tropical place? American Airlines gave us one night at an all- inclusive resort on the ocean with free transportation to and from the resort. They had also booked us for the flight the next day. That was the good part. The next day the gate was crowded because they were trying to board two flights at one gate. It was a total disaster. We were delayed about 1 hour but managed to get to ORD ahead of schedule.
4506,Flight 0267 Munich - Haneda Economy. Very good service very clean plane but terrible seats. Narrowest seat I have experienced on a long-haul flight. Tight seat pitch as well. Absolutely unsuitable for an 11 hour flight. With these tight seats ANA has gone from having one of the best economy classes in the industry to arguably having the most uncomfortable one. I will avoid ANA in the future and either use Lufthansa JAL or Finnair.
4507,Flight NH801 Tokyo-Singapore. New 787. Excellent service. Great Japanese menu. Terrible seats. Extremely uncomfortable! Suitable for up 3 hours flight but not 8 hours trip. There seats are big mistake. I will try to avoid in future 787 on long routes.
4508,LAX-DEN. Very lucky to make my connection off a QANTAS flight from Australia due to delays in LAX security (even though 2 hours between flights). I made it to the gate but then told that I had to get a bus which wasn't arriving for another 10 minutes. This should be advised somewhere because I was not made aware of this fact. The Eagle terminal is ok but nothing to eat other than vending machines. ERJ140 flight across to Denver was very good - I have flown the ERJ a few times on AE recently and it is very comfortable for a regional jet. Had the single seat on the left hand side next to the aisle - fine for a 2 hour flight. Overall I don't mind flying on the ERJ - it beats a turboprop anyday!
4509,American Airlines seriously needs to reconsider its business plan of overbooking every single flight on one day and how that affects passengers trying to make connections when one flight is late. They also need to train their employees to treat passengers with respect and provide more telephone customer service options that don't leave you waiting 45-51 minutes. My flight was 90 minutes late out of Miami and I therefore missed my connection to San Francisco and apparently every other flight was overbooked for the next 24 hours which is completely insane.
4510,Chicago ORD to YYC on a small CR7 jet. Overhead compartments won't take rollerbags so they have to be gate checked. Seats are small & uncomfortable. Fortunately the flight was less than half full so I sprawled out in the 2 economy seats in my row. The CR7 is too small of a plane to fly 3-4 hrs in. FAs pleasant and attentive enough.
4511,DCA-JFK as part of international trip. Check in staff extremely rude and abrasive. Wanted to charge for bag even though I was clearly on an international ticket. Problem solved by Admirals Club staff member who was superb and redeemed the flight. Was not warned that small Embraer cannot accommodate carry-ons which lead to delays and confusion during boarding. FA was unfriendly and seemed utterly disinterested in safety demo.
4512,DCA-JFK-DCA ERJ 140. Outbound flight was very good with on-time service an efficient and pleasant flight attendant plus informative crew. The inbound flight left the gate on time at JFK but didn't take off for another hour. Flight attendant provided minimal service. The outbound aircraft was newer but both were clean though the ERJ 140 is not comfortable due to the curvature of the fuselage at floor level. Checked baggage and valet cabin bags were delivered promptly. Overall this regional connector was acceptable for a flight of less than an hour not counting the pre-takeoff delay at JFK. Ticket price was higher than justifiable for this short flight.
4513,Flight 3314 supposed to depart 845pm. Six gate changes rude staff. An hour and counting delay while we wait for catering truck. I hate flying American. Will use it only as last resort now.
4514,Supposed to leave Miami to Milan at 14.30 but delayed twice. In the end we left with 4 hours of delays. The plane was an old fashioned 767-300 seats were small and dirty. Entertainment was overhead screens far from our seats. A real nightmare.
4515,Flew First Class from Buenos Aires - Dallas/Ft Worth on a 777-200. The seats while dated are roomy with lots of leg room and storage space. Boarding was quick although the agents and gate security at EZE leave a bit to be desired. Our flight attendants were ok nothing remarkable. Food was filling and of fair quality. The seat is lie- angled and not super comfortable but comfy enough to relax and watch the dated IFE. I can't complain about sitting in First Class on this 11 hour flight but the whole experience was just mediocre.
4516,CLE-LGA JFK-CLE. I needed to get to NYC early to catch an international flight leaving from EWR (due to airline changing airports) and this was my only option at the time. I checked the seating chart and also called customer service to see what the flight load was and the rep said the plane was pretty full and for $50.00 I could do a same day confirmed standby so I did. I arrived at CLE gate to find only 7 passengers on the flight. What a rip-off! The FA was nice BOB for snacks. Return flight was much better flight was passengers PAX total . FA was great and very personable. Many carry-ons were gate checked and were received shortly after landing.
4517,AA63 CDG to MIA AA931 MIA to EZE AA990 GIG to MIA AA62 MIA to CDG. Worst cabin service unimaginable seats still using the ancient TV screens on ceiling on Trans Atlantic and South American flights! Imagine looking at a small screen on top of the ceiling during a 10 hour flight. They only screen 1 movie on the entire flight.
4518,Flight from Miami to Phoenix flight 303. First class was a major disappointment from old plane to slowest service ever no pre-flight drinks and then waited over 1 hour before a beverage was served. Sorry to say the New American feels like to old AA famous for poor service. Loyal US Air at least they tried and had a sense of urgency.
4519,Flew business class MNL-NRT-LAX and back. Food was better the last time I flew with them (2 years ago). Service a hit or miss - sometimes you get a friendly FA sometimes you come across a robot-like one. On my return trip I checked in 2 pieces of luggage one weighing 23kg and the other 33kg. The lady at the check in counter said I needed to pay 200usd for the overweight baggage and I was horrified. I said but my other bag is just 23kg! Then I should just transfer 1kg of my heavy bag to the lighter one. I was in disbelief! I felt like I was flying economy for the treatment I was getting. Remedied only when I had asked her to call her supervisor.
4520,Toronto to La Guardia. Very helpful at check in and gate. Small old aircraft but nice flight attendant on board and served a drink on the short flight. Age of airplane was my only concern.
4521,Round-trip from Miami to CDG Paris. Cabin seats with little to no leg space and I'm not a large person. I passed on the food on the return trip as the chicken dish on the trip from Miami to Paris was lukewarm and horrible. In recent years I have seen fares on the international flights rise rapidly and in my opinion they have done little to justify the price increase. In the future I will look for another airline.
4522,"I can say nothing beyond the miserable seats. The seat backs don't recline at all. The seat itself moves forward. That may be fine if your 5'5"" or so but at 6'3"" it's a disaster. My knees are already touching the seat back in front so when seat moves forward to recline what are you supposed to do with your legs. Unbelievably poor design. Makes sleeping impossible as head never gets back far enough. Never again I hope. Just another addition to the misery that flying has become."
4523,Flew back from Las Vegas to Grand Forks ND. Flight # 484 March 15th. If you want your holiday plans ruined then fly Allegiant. Their planes are overused and mechanical failures are often and cause delays each time that I flew. When you check in they treat you with disrespect. They charge you extra for service that is non-existent and you sit cramped in tiny seats with no circulation to your legs. Staff are very rude and have no people skills. Be prepared to pay extra for carrying a small tote handbag on board.
4524,PSI-BLI flight 211 16th March. Late 50% of the time. Fly 40+yr old DC10's. Online info wrong and outdated. Nickled and dimed to death - almost the same cost as a decent airline especially when factoring in car travel. You pay for what you get - will never fly with them again!
4525,Key West - MIA. Easy check in thereafter clueless/lacking service and rude staff. Plane late without any particular reason given. Succeeded to get places to the next flight which departed earlier only after insisting on various (non-responding uninterested) persons (we were about to miss the following transatlantic flight). Service onboard unfriendly.
4526,Flew business SJU-JFK-LHR. SJU-JFK leg on old 757 with no individual video screens and pretty tired cabin. Food was virtually inedible. Admirals Club lounge at JFK OK but I resent having to pay for a packet of crisps when I've paid thousands for a ticket. JFK-LHR was much better: new 777 with really comfy flat bed and amazing noise cancelling headphones. Food was still awful (but food is generally dreadful in the USA anyway so to be expected. Flight slightly late but overall pretty good - particularly like the fact I wasn't woken up until 25 minutes before landing.
4527,"I was stuck in the same situation around the same time as the previous commenter. I waited in DFW airport for almost 3 days waiting for a flight out due to fog which was a legitimate problem. However my biggest complaint was the seeming nonchalance about the situation. After being put on standby after my initial flight was cancelled and watching the next 4 flights cancel as well I was informed that no more flights were going out that day (it was 7pm) and no more would be scheduled. Granted I don't know the specifics that need to take place to schedule/staff flights but I don't feel like AE/AA did anywhere near what they could have to remedy the situation. On another trip I arrived to the small regional airport I fly out of 40 minutes before my flight (I know they say an hour but its such a tiny place there is never an issue). I went to the check in desk and found that there were no AE/AA employees there. Anywhere. I asked the agent from another line what was going on and was told ""AE runs with only barebones staff and he went on break."" I waited 15 minutes until the agent arrived and was told ""Oh ma'am you missed your flight."" I then spent the rest of the day on standby trying to catch one of only a few flights out. I made it thank goodness but the nonchalance and general organization of AE definitely made for a less than pleasant trip."
4528,"DAL to LIT. Recently flew Am Eagle from Dallas to Little Rock. When I got on the plane the senior citizen next to me asked the stewardess where the restroom was located. The stewardess rudely stated that ""they announced at the gate that the restroom is broken and you should go before you get on the plane."" When we informed her that neither of us heard the annoucement she just stared. Then she said ""well it is just a short flight so it is okay-only 53 minutes."" I tried to explain that for us senior citizens that it is not okay and she just walked away. I mean come on. Can't they even maintain the restrooms? And to make matters worse I complained to American Airlines and have yet to get a response. Poor maintenance issues late flights and rude agents in the past made me start to doubt the airline and this is just the frosting on the cake!"
4529,I had about a 10 hr non stop flight from Paris to New York. There was no in seat TV. Only 2-3 TVs in the aisle and they asked for $5 each for headphones to listen to the movies they were playing of their choice. All the flight attendants were rude. I needed a blanket but they denied this. Overall it was a lesson for me to avoid American Airlines flights wherever possible.
4530,Flying from O'Hare to DC - rude attendant who let several passengers on board with 2 bags some larger than my single carry-on. I had to stow my bag because I had a shopping bag. When I offered to collapse the bag and place it under the seat I was told that I could not carry both onto the plane. Once we boarded the plane we were kept on the ground for 3 hours without water and/or food for those of us unlucky enough to not have brought our own on board. When I asked an attendant if I could have a bottle of water I was told that no service could be provided and to be patient that we would be departing soon (this was about two hours before our flight took off). When the flight eventually took off we were offered options for snacks when I requested my option I was told that they had run out. Why offer an option at all? When the drink cart eventually made its way to me I asked for a coke and was given 1/2 a coke served for me in a cup. When I asked for a second one I was told that they had limited quantities. Outdated plane with the tv screens down the middle row. Horrible service - rude check-in attendants and complete incompetence from the entire crew. I will not fly American Airlines again.
4531,Kobe-Haneda. My flight departed at 7.05am. ANA specified 1 hr check-in time for luggage deposit. Therefore I had to take a taxi at 5.30am from Kobe Chuo-ko. I arrived at 5.50am. The airport doors were simply closed. Kobe airport physically opens at 6.00 i.e. 5 Minutes before last check-in (with luggage) official time. Indeed due to this fact they extended it to 6.30. They could have advised passengers. Loss of money and sleep!
4532,We were on the fourth flight scheduled from San Juan to Tortola BVI. The first three were cancelled due to mechanical problems with the plane. The fourth flight finally left 2 hours late. American Eagle does not have enough mechanics or spare parts to keep their planes in the air in a reliable way. In the future I will fly to St. Thomas and take the ferry to Tortola to avoid American Eagle.
4533,"YYZ-HEL-YYZ. I had booked a return trip from Toronto to Helsinki via JFK. The New York - Helsinki leg was on Finnair and the service on those flights was great but the Toronto - New York connection was sold to me as Finnair codeshare on American Eagle. Quite soon after I had arrived at Toronto checked in and gone through security it was announced that the American Eagle flight to JFK will be delayed by an hour because of ""bad weather"" at JFK. For me the delay meant missing my Finnair flight from JFK to HEL and so as soon as I heard about the delay I tried to track down the American Eagle/American Airlines staff in Toronto to see what can be done to help me make it on the Finnair flight. However the AE/AA staff was nowhere to be found. When I finally got to talk with them I talked with several people whose advice was basically just this: ""Well there is another Finnair flight from JFK to HEL the next day you just catch that one instead."" When I finally made it to JFK an hour and 10 minutes late the Finnair flight was leaving in 2 minutes. We were at gate 34 and Finnair at gate 4. I ran all the way and made it. Obviously my bag didn't. I would've liked to see AE/AA help me somehow along the way but nothing was offered. Glad I made it though and I got my bag the next day."
4534,YYZ-ORD-YYZ. Booked flights on American Eagle online then realised that they use rather small aircraft and regretted it! However our return flight from Toronto to Chicago was pretty good. Check in and bag drop was fast efficient and the AA staff on duty were courteous and friendly. Admiral's Club lounge was ok at both ends - complimentary glass of wine in ORD. Both flights on time and the advantage of these smaller Embraer 145s is that they can be filled and unloaded quickly. Efficient FA each way if not over friendly and complimentary soft drinks served. Seat belt sign on for duration of flights each way a few bumps here and there. Seats were comfortable enough for a one hour flight and leg room was ok (neither my partner or I are particularly small people). Landed early at Toronto and sat on runway for a few minutes waiting for gate to become available. But all in all a pretty good experience for the fare.
4535,Four hour fog delay from Midland to DFW. Sat on the Tarmac for a half hour to get to a gate at DFW. Then waited 45 min. on someone to open the door. Return flight was at 6.10pm - delay after delay and finally canceled at 9pm due to weather. Kicker is an AA flight left the same terminal an hour later for Midland. We couldn't schedule another flight to Midland until two days later. Agents were the rudest most disrespectful and uncaring people you would ever want to run across. If you ever desire to travel with AA don't.
4536,Flight from Chicago to Paris on Thurs (12/5/14) was nothing but miserable. AA brought two planes to the gate when neither could pass safety inspection. The big question is why the planes made it to the gate in the first place. Passengers were then told that another plane had been found (another gate) but it needed to be inspected cleaned and finally loaded - they did provide soda and pretzels during the 3.5+ hour wait (big deal). We finally boarded a not-too-clean plane (I found trash in the seat pocket) and it was cold for the entire trip. We saw the staff twice - once to serve what they call dinner and once when they served a cold breakfast. The trip was just plain awful and makes me want to give up travel by air altogether. One bright spot that has nothing to do with AA - it was a SMOOTH flight and we made it in record time due to a good tail wind.
4537,"Haneda-CDG. Disappointed by ANA lounge in HND much worse than the new one in NRT. Wi-fi weak and not working in the ""allowed to phone calls"" zone. ANA ignores that we use SKYPE VIBER WHAT'S APP etc. 777-300 old Business class seats hard. Excellent behavior from flight attendants. Delicious food but once again very poor wines including low cost Champagne. This is a sub-product compared with NRT-JFK flight for instance. How can an airline have such discrepancies?"
4538,"St. Louis to Nashville return. Both flights left and arrived exactly on time. Both planes were clean and orderly. Even though both were ""regional jets"" I had a exit row on the way out and row #1 on the way back which meant plenty of leg room both ways. The in-flight service was fine considering both were 1 hour flights."
4539,Toronto to Louisville return via Chicago - Plane was 45 minutes late at departure which meant that I had to run to make my Chicago connection (they literally closed the door after me). We flew on Embraers on each flight - interiors in pretty poor shape and quite dirty with in-flight magazines looking as if they had been used to clean the floors. The seats were incredibly narrow and all planes were full. Service was very friendly though with the hostesses apologetic for the hideous quality of the snacks. Free soft drinks departing from Louisville but not from Toronto. I flew on an award ticket but I'm not sure I would pay full price for such a trip.
4540,22 Aug 2014 UA9711 NRT-BKK. Kudos to ANA for its inflight service and attitude. Everything from check-in to boarding went smoothly. I could heartily recommend this airline if service and attitude were the main components of the trip. Seat comfort however is at the other end of the satisfaction spectrum. The pitch was really tight and the recline was uncomfortable. I think I would be happy to trade great inflight service for more in seat comfort.
4541,One way trip First Class from SFO-LAS via LAX.. First sector SFO-LAX excellent service crew couldn't do enough on this short flight. LAX-LAS complete opposite. Shame passengers had to hear how unhappy the crew were about their job.
4542,Scheduled to leave from Sacramento CA at 8am on 11/24/14. I got an automated call Sunday evening at around 11.30pm stating that my flight out of Sacramento would be delayed until 9:37AM. I was fine with this - I realize delays happen. I still arrived at the airport as if my flight were to leave at it's original 8am departure just in case. When I arrived at the American Airlines counter the women working there proceeded to tell me that because of this delay there would be no way for me to make my connection in Dallas to Montgomery. She made me feel confident that I would indeed miss my connection in Dallas. She said she had changed my flight connection in Dallas to an 9pm departure instead of the original 3.15pm flight out to Montgomery. I wasn't thrilled that I would be arriving much later but it would work. The flight from Sacramento arrived in Dallas at 2:45PM. I had thirty minutes to make my original flight. I made it with a couple minutes to spare. The women at the counter looked up my name and said I could no longer get onto this flight because my flight itinerary had been changed. I then was stuck in Dallas Airport for over 6 hours. AA staff I had talked to about my situation had any sympathy for the situation which made me even more angry. It was nothing but a speed bump into their work day. I would never recommend flying with American Airlines.
4543,Flight 966 from Punta Gorda to Peoria IL. Ft. Myers area experienced storms for about 1.5 hrs in the morning. Our flight was scheduled at 3.30pm. All flights prior to us were delayed when we checked in. Approx 30 min prior to departure I received about 3 texts delaying flight hour by hour until 9.45. Then the gate agent announced that due to shuffling of aircraft our flight was delayed until midnight. They announced we could leave airport and return later. I never did receive a text about the last delay and the website never reflected this either. In the meantime every flight scheduled after us departed either delayed slightly or on time. We then found out Allegiant hired a Sun Country flight to pick up passengers first in PIA and bring them to Punta Gorda and then take us home. This flight arrived at 12.00 am. We were then held off from boarding for another 1 hour as we waited for them to deplane 3 more flights that had arrived shortly after our plane. We in finally took off at 1.45 am. Paid for seat and because aircraft was different it was changed to open seating. Staff ordered pizza for everyone and provided soft drinks and water. I can understand delays like this if weather is bad. Difficult to watch several flights fly out that were scheduled after us. Very true you get what you pay for.
4544,Manchester to New York. Their standards are poor even from arriving at the boarding gate - why split passengers into groups and then not pay attention to how those groups board the plane? Surely after business class and those with priority shouldn't the next set of passengers to board the plane be those at the rear. That process would help to ensure the plane left on time rather than almost 20 minutes late. Their fleet is old-fashioned with screens down the centre aisle which cannot be viewed from certain seats. The seats were uncomfortable - 8 hours spent in one of those is not a pleasant experience. We gained the impression that the crew and their requirements over-rode passenger considerations - clearing away too quickly before passengers had time to finish the poor quality meals having to be quiet whilst in the vicinity of sleeping staff and very few drinks/snacks being offered is not what long haul flights should be about. Even the crew's uniform was shabby.
4545,Scheduled to fly Bellingham to Honolulu (7pm) on Feb 17 2014 and sat in the departure gate and listened to a few delay messages before the staff member at the gate desk vanished. An hour later I went searching for an Allegiant rep to update us. Then told the flight was cancelled - rumour had it that the flight crew did not have sufficient hours to complete the journey. This stranded a full plane load of passengers. I can understand and support the safety reasons that support the crew not flying but I think this indicates very poor management. We were provided hotel accommodation and flew out the next day at 12 noon. We and many others lost the prepaid hotel payments for the night of the 17th we did not show.
4546,March 3 scheduled flight from Palm Springs to Belingham. The rescheduled flight departed as advertised on March 4 and landed on time. Some apologies from airline staff about previous day's snafu but no explanations tendered. On arrival at Bellingham I learned from other sources that there had been many cancellations due to ground fog and poor visibility at Bellngham airport. If this was indeed the reason for Allegiant's problems the previous day they never mentioned it. Returning March 6 from Bellingham online check-in didn't work for me forced to wait in line for nearly an hour to get boarding pass. Actual flight left and arrived on time no untoward events. If Allegiant was more forthcoming keeping its clients properly informed of what was happening they could save a lot of the ill will and frustration they engender among their clients when things go wrong. My previous recommendation stands: if you want cheap fares and time is not pressing they're ok otherwise choose a more expensive and hopefully more customer-friendly airline such as WestJet.
4547,Terrible service for the money that you pay. We flew from Manchester to New York direct the inbound flight took 9 hours seats where uncomfortable they only had televisions in the aisle - no PTV and no headphones provided. Served food half an hour into the flight then left for 7 hours without anybody asking us if we needed a drink - received a smaller snack 40 mins before landing which made you feel you had to rush as they where already standing waiting for the rubbish before you had finished. The staff were unfriendly and rude. The flight home was exactly the same and to get a drink you had to walk to the back of the plane and ask yourself with more than one occasion being told they had ran out.
4548,Nov 22 AA 1520 El Salvador to Miami. AA 2487 Miami to Orlando. Will never use this airline again. Connecting flights at Miami are the worst specially international flights. They schedule connecting flights within an hour and a half apart yet they land every international flight at terminal D in Miami 5-10 mins apart. On top of all this their outbound flights are late and incoming planes have to wait to have a new gate. What is the issue with this immigration and customs are 1 hour behind making it difficult to connect. You would think the airline can have someone trying to help you get through or guide you to reconnect to another flight well that is not the case. They take their time and don't care about you.
4549,This review is for an economy class NRT-JFK trip. First off I would recommend ANA when flying to the US because overall the inflight experience is excellent thanks to the fabulous cabin crew. So much better than dealing with any of the US carriers and their surly service. However my numerous experiences with the ground staff at Narita airport makes me absolutely dread the return leg of my trip between NY and TYO. The check-in process is so confusing and takes so long. All the agents seem to be either new or have no concept of processing passengers quickly. It always takes 20 minutes from the time I reach the counter to when I leave it. Despite being polite and smiling the agents don't really give good advice and are not very helpful to be quite honest. If it weren't for the great cabin crew I'd rate the staff service as very poor. Inflight the economy class seats on the B777-300 are uncomfortable because of the head rest that juts out pushes my head forward so I'm sitting with my chin on my neck. I noticed a lot of passengers sleeping with their heads resting on the tray tables probably because of this. The economy class meals are just horrible. I have learned to buy or pack my own. The drink selections are good. The inflight entertainment is mediocre especially their music selection.
4550,Scheduled on 2/17/14 to fly from Newport News to Orlando/Sanford at 5.46pm. At 4pm we received a message the flight was delayed followed by information it was on time for departure. Checked in and then notified it was delayed an hour. We then had 3 more delays and by 11pm we were ready for boarding. It got worse from there as the flight crew walked off the job. They had to piece a crew together for the flight to Newport News. So we then boarded the aircraft they announced we needed to hurry up or they would not fly. This was just frustrating by this point seemed rude way to approach the situation when they were at fault for the longer then expected delays. 7 days later we were set to return at Orlando/Sanford it was really disorganised at check in and you could only check in when they announced they would allow you to do so. Last but not least we were able to check in we had 1.5 hours until departure and decided to have lunch. Then we got notification our flight was delayed. After a 2 hour delay we boarded and the pilot apologized for the delay. Sometimes you pay for what you get and don't understand how they are still in business. Poor communication rude from my experience and how they treated other customers.
4551,I flew with my family from CGK to LAX and back from SFO to CGK (2 in business class and 3 in economy class). Business class seems up to expectations but economy class seems a bit cramped especially from Narita to Jakarta. Here are the positive things about ANA: service staff attitude on time performance baggage handling cleanliness inside cabin. But there are negatives as well: hard shell seat on economy class (especially for small aircraft) entertainment is a bit outdated.
4552,Flight 729 Little Rock to Orlando March 2 2014. We arrive at the airport early to find out that our flight is delayed. No one can give us any answers on the status of our flight. Our original flight was suppose to depart at 5.50pm we were finally able to board at 10pm. Once we boarded the plane they made us wait while they de-iced the plane. After 45 mins we push back from the gate to be de-iced. We wait another 30 mins for the de-ice truck. After a 2 or more hour wait we are brought back to the gate to de-plane. This takes another 30 mins or more before the her bridge is even brought to our plane. Once off the plane all they tell us is sorry be back tomorrow morning at 10am our flight is scheduled to depart at noon. They do not tell us which baggage claim our bags will be located we just have to wonder around baggage claim until we find it. This is another long wait. The next morning we are notified that our flight is delayed from departing at noon to now at 4.30pm. We have now lost 2 of our vacation days money spent on hotels and money on rental cars. You may pay more with other airlines but you will have a better chance making it to your final destination.
4553,I flew last month and the experience was not pleasant. The flight from St. Petersburg/Clearwater FL to Greenville SC was scheduled to leave at 9am. The evening prior to our departure we received an electronic communication of the flight being delayed to 1pm. I was appreciative of the communication until I showed up to the airport only to find that the flight was delayed again until 3.30. This time I received no communication and the board at the airport as well as their website still showed a 1.00 departure time. As if that wasn't enough after paying for a seat assignment they could not honor it due to using a different plane. So it became open seating. Unfortunately it appears from their rude demeanour the ground staff do not care about their customers. The only bright spot was the flight crew! They were very good to passengers! All in all I may have to fly from a different airport in the future which is sad because I frequent this area and prefer the regional airport but if Allegiant cannot be more dependable then I will fly an airline that cares about my business.
4554,Multiple North American flights during month including ORD-AUS AUS-DFW DFW-PBI EWR-DFW DFW-YVR YVR-DFW DFW- PBI PBI-LAX. Traveling through the US and Canada during November found me on several AA flights most in first class with upgrades a few in economy. On balance the flights were ok nothing special no notable problems. Most flights were on or close to schedule service was generally better than expected. The biggest negative is AA's equipment on these routes. All B737 or MD Super 80 aircraft. Generally confining for mid-long haul domestic and the S80s are just so old it is a wonder that AA still uses them as much as they do - not a very passenger friendly aircraft.
4555,HND-ITM. B787. On time. Excellent service. Seats are extremely uncomfortable. 3x3x3. Raw 10A/B/C have no screen!
4556,"Fly from MDT to Orlando/Sanford. Check in was a little rough due to no one delegating which line was the line for people who already checked in vs people just arriving and not checked in ahead of time. Flight left on time. Seats weren't anything special but it's an airplane not your living room sofa. Flight attendants were helpful and nice. The airline is a discount airline so you're going to get charge for the ""frills"". You get a discounted ticket but you're going to end up paying for the extra stuff right down to the seating and bags. Our flight back to MDT was delayed 2 hours but the weather was bad that day with snow up North and thunderstorms down South. Not much anyone could do with that setback. All in all I'd use them again and even suggest it to people I know could handle it."
4557,Feb 28 return Mar 3 2014 Springfield MO to Clearwater/St Petersburg FL. Outward leg on an Allegiant A320. Brand new seats but seats very uncomfortable and small seat pitch. Very small tray table not even large enough to hold a laptop and a beverage at the same time. These seats are perhaps the worse seats I have encountered. Slight delay due to computer errors pilots had to reboot the computers. Three delayed flights arrived same time in St Petersburg and our luggage did not arrive in the terminal for an hour and 20 minutes. Return on Miami Air International- sub contracting for Allegiant. 737-800 aircraft better seats and room plus given bottled water pretzels and cookies. No issues on return flight.
4558,Booked to fly PSP-BLI Mar 3 on flight 211 leaving 7.12 arriving 10pm. Received recorded phone call and email that morning that there would be 4 hour delay flight would now arrive at 2 am. Later same day received further phone / email that departure time changed to 10.15 from previous 11.15pm. On arriving at waiting lounge at 9.15pm found departure now back to 11.15. Eventually announcement about cancellation made over PA system. Two harassed and overworked employees dealt reasonably well in the circumstances explaining about replacement flight next day and providing overnight accommodation to those who needed it. I have frequently travelled Allegiant in the past but have suffered two very bad delays so far in 2014. Their planes are old and possibly more subject to mechanical defects their spare planes and aircrews are few ground support staff are seldom to be seen and apparently not well informed on operational problems. Allegiant's prices are cheap if you are traveling light and prepared to put up with frequent and lengthy delays but if dependable service is what you want pay up and go elsewhere.
4559,What began as a simple flight from San Jose CA to New York NY (JFK) connecting at LAX has resulted in frustration and anger. Upon arriving at San Jose international airport with two hours to spare my fiancÃ© and I each checked a bag. Our flight was projected to leave at 2.45pm PST and read 'On Time' on the departures kiosk. Without any announcement or updates our flight arrived late had to be refuelled and in turn was 30 minutes delayed. We missed our connection at LAX by five minutes and after spending far too much time in the customer service office were rebooked on a 9.30 Delta flight to JFK. Told there was no need to check-in all we would have to do is go to the gate and speak to the representative at the counter. An hour before our flight we walk to the appropriate gate only to be told that while we were listed as passengers there were no seats for us and that American should have booked seats on our behalf. We returned to the customer service office spending an hour waiting in line. An American Airlines rep took us from counter to counter trying to find us two seats on any plane. The only availability was on a place via Nashville to LaGuardia with an hour layover. As we were boarding we were pulled off the plane because he had found us a direct flight to JFK which would make finding our bags that much better. Finally arriving in JFK at 7.15 am our bags were nowhere to be found.
4560,JFK to Orlando in First. Check-in staff very helpful to our party of 6 after arrival from London. Given access to Admirals Club because long-haul had been business class. Pleasant lounge but only stayed about 20 minutes. Priority boarding and seats comfortable for a medium-length domestic flight. Captain announced that he would delay take-off whilst 35 passengers from a delayed European flight made the transfer and took off when about half that number had boarded. But the real surprise was when the flight attendant came round and said that because of the timing (early afternoon) there was no catering on the flight. Thus a 3-hour flight with just several rounds of a basket containing nuts biscuits and crisps - not a first class offering. Other than that the whole experience was much better (with arrival only slightly delayed) than I had feared given some of the reviews on here.
4561,March 4 2014 - we returned from trip to Las Vegas on Allegiant it was a 2 day delay going down and a 5 hour delay on the return. I have never had such bad service. Do not be fooled by the cheap prices they don't care about the passengers and are only there for the money. Our vacation was ruined as we lost 2 days of our trip. When we finally got on board after waiting over 40 hours they would not even pay for our drinks.
4562,Paid for F Class JFK-MCO via MIA. AA's JFK Terminal is beautiful. Dedicated F class check in with arrogant staff agents should be mindful of vocal tones and questions. Premium Security line ended up not being during slow time of day as TSA putting 3 non premium bodies to 1 in the same scanner line even though another was available. I purchased a day pass for the Admirals Club as I was quite early for my flight. The JFK Lounge is very nice service was good staff were very kind especially the lady at reception. Purchased a Fruit and Cheese Plate and was surprised in a happy way. Flt to MIA in a 757 intl config. with angle lie flat 2X2 seated at the window. The seats are awkward to get in/out of when upright impossible to escape a window seat with another either sitting or laying down. I tried the angle lie flat position and lasted less than 30 min. in that position simply uncomfortable might as well stand in the galley. The Lay-z-boy option of recline is very nice. PDB was offered no restrictions. Nice looking IFE pity I was never offered headsets to use it. Cocktails with nuts in a bowl served after take off then dinner. AA seems to have downgraded the nut mix with less premium nuts in the mix. The dinner was the biggest shock. The Pre ordered Lasagne was vile and the salad pathetic. Club in Miami is ok with pleasant staff. MIA-MCO in 757 Dom. config. FA's awful on this leg. Airplane broke after we boarded no one seemed to have a clue what to do next. Gate agents and Admirals Club unable to contact ops via phone for updates. No words. Next plane boarded later than promised with no reason offered. Short Flt to MCO uneventful after 2 plus hour delay. There are some things to improve at AA but there is a lot right.
4563,"Based upon our experience of American Airlines' flights from the USA to the UK several years ago and to reduce the effects of jet-lag my wife and I decided to take the daytime flight AA90 which departs Chicago (ORD) at 09.05 and arrives in London (LHR) at 22.45. In retrospect this was a mistake. The Chicago Admiral's Club lounge was most disappointing. Surprisingly no food (unless you paid for it) was available except a few sad-looking bagels and muffins. So we were hungry when the flight took off. We were seated in seats 2A & 2B (the first row on the B767-300ER aircraft) and the seats were comfortable enough with good leg room. However the aircraft was certainly showing its age. In business class (there is no first class on this flight) there are no seat-back screens and the passengers are given small tablets and Bose headphones on which to watch movies. The movie/music selection was poor and was nothing to get excited about. The food that we were served (breakfast and a pre- landing ""snack"") was probably the worst airline food we have ever experienced. It was virtually inedible and it compared extremely unfavourably with the food that we were served in British Airways business class on our flight to the USA three weeks earlier. Furthermore the cabin attendants were virtually invisible. On the eight-hour flight I was never once offered tea or coffee - all I was given was a bottle of water to drink. Two hours before the flight landed in London I had to find a flight attendant and ask for a Bacardi and Coke - no flight attendant ever asked me if I would like something to drink. Unlike British Airways business class on our American Airlines flight we could see no sign of a basket in the kitchen area containing anything to snack on (like bars and sweets). American Airlines do you think that this is acceptable? Just what are business class passengers paying several thousand dollars/pounds over the economy fare for? (You do not arrive any earlier than the people sitting in the back). The food and service we experienced on our flight from ORD to LHR were completely unacceptable and based on our recent experience fear that it will be a very long time before we fly on American Airlines in business class again."
4564,My wife and I flew from San Jose (SJC) to Chicago (ORD) on AA1530 in first class. San Jose is certainly a very pleasant little airport but unfortunately there is no American Airlines Admiral's Club room for first and business passengers. Our seats on the aircraft (3A & 3B - the first row of seats on the B737-800) were fairly comfortable and there was enough leg room. We had pre-ordered our meal on-line and it was described as miso chicken. Our meals although nicely served were of very poor quality so much so that my wife refused to eat any more after the first few mouthfuls. The flight attendant who looked after us was pleasant. courteous and helpful. But the three-hour flight as far as we were concerned was spoilt by food of very poor quality - not what you expect when you are travelling first class.
4565,Flew back from Mesa on one of their newer larger planes. The seats were the most crowded and most uncomfortable I have endured! In theory Allegiant is convenient and affordable but the reality is that they nickle and dime you to death miss scheduled times on a regular basis and now abuse and insult their passengers with terrible seating!
4566,Allegiant is a budget airline and the old saying that you get what you pay for applies. We were delayed 2 days and they made us sit in the airport for hours before finally cancelling and only send an email to tell you the rescheduling time. They also don't tell you that email is how you will be notified. The flight attendants chew gum when serving people which looks highly unprofessional. When you try to call to rebook you can expect a long hold. I found some of the agents to be very helpful and others not. It would have to be a pretty huge saving for me to pick this airline again.
4567,DFW to LHR on new 777-300. Although American has updated their fleet and now have a business class seat that competes with most European carriers they really need to improve the service standard and the selection of their cabin personnel. Flight attendants were in a hurry to finish service and rude the quality of food just average and the presentation and amenities nothing remarkable. There was not the feeling of being in Business class on this flight.
4568,Singapore to Hokkaido via Tokyo and return. A good performance but nowhere near what I would describe as 5-star. Firstly as many others have mentioned here the shell seats on the 787 are a joke - very very uncomfortable with no possibility of getting into a sleep-friendly position. As far as I'm concerned these seats are a deal-breaker. I would not fly with ANA on a medium or long-haul flight if the seats were this design. The food was acceptable without being outstanding. The service was good but not exceptional. The short hops between Tokyo and Sapporo were efficient and smooth.
4569,Flew from Haneda to Frankfurt on the Dreamliner. Happy to be on board of that plane as someone who usually gets headaches on long-haul flights you can tell the cabin atmosphere is really a lot better here. I'm not so impressed with the seat width this config had 9 abreast in economy which is really narrow. Prepare for elbow struggles with your neighbor(s). Worst aspect was the food. The flight left at 1am so I can understand they don't start serving hot meals but the replacement sandwich was really extremely basic. Nothing else followed till breakfast which was I'm sad to say awful. I am quite happy with airline food but this was really not tasty not fresh worthless really. I will consider other options on my trips to/from Japan despite the overall professionalism punctuality and nice airplane. One final detail - is it really necessary to close the curtains between economy and business upon landing? I mean rub it in extra that cattle class passengers have to wait deboarding until the elite has left?
4570,Flew this airline for the first time Feb 13th from Clearwater FL. Flight was delayed 1 hour and we were notified the night before. The flight coming home was a different experience. Flight was delayed 3 hours got the notification 2 hours after the first delay we had to be at the airport at 6am for original flight. The airline had to change their aircraft due to mechanical difficulty. My daughter is flying to SC in March because she is in a wedding the following day already got notification her flight is delay 5 hours can't take the chance for anymore delays.
4571,AA 262 B737 RSW to DFW 1st November 2014 good flight in First Class comfortable seat food surprisingly good for short flight no personal IFE seat not as good as US Airways A320.
4572,I flew American for the first time today and will never fly with them again. My entire experience was horrible. My flight was delayed for 2 hours causing me to miss my connecting flight. So in addition to having already spent my whole morning in an airport I had to have my second flight rescheduled which cost me an additional 2 hours of wait time. Then my second flight is delayed 30 minutes because according to the pilot they hadn't removed the Jetway tunnel. Finally I arrive at my destination only to be informed that my luggage ended up on a different flight from mine and that I would have to wait an additional hour and a half before that flight arrived. Never using them again.
4573,We flew AA from Minneapolis to Chicago (ORD) to NY (LGA) - JFK to Paris (CDG) and MIA to MSP. After reading many bad reviews I though I would say that we had no bad experiences at all. we were given an exit row seat on our JFK-Paris flight. The food was normal airline food not great but I enjoyed the meals. I am 6 ft 2 and I had enough room on all my flights. The service was pleasant. The onboard entertainment was lacking on the 767 to Paris but I slept so it did not bother me.
4574,Since this is the only airline that flies from Harrisburg PA (MDT) to Clearwater/St Pete I am stuck flying with them. I have flown many times with Allegiant and not once have they been on time. The least amount of time that the flight was delayed 3 hours. I have learned my lesson with Allegiant. Expect nothing. Rude service extremely long check-in lines horrible seats nothing not even a bottle of water is free. I am actually scheduled to fly today. Flight 803 10.47am. I have now been advised the flight is leaving at 5.03pm.
4575,Manchester to Florida via Chicago. I had no real issue with the internal flights to Chicago but have a number of issues with the long haul flight to Chicago. The seats were in no way suitable very little leg room and I can imagine that it was very awkward if you didn't know the person sitting either side of you. The food wasn't too bad on the way out but if you suffered any dietary requirements it was tough. The flight ran out of certain drinks outbound and on the return journey. On the return journey we were sat at the back and we had to settle for what was left food wise as they'd run out of one of the options. The majority of the attendants were either rude sarcastic and had obviously missed the training session on customer service. Inflight entertainment was poor AA seem to be stuck in the dark ages with one tiny screen for every few seats. Overall I was very disappointed with the service which made a long flight seem even longer. I've definitely been spoilt with Virgin Atlantic who I will be using from now on.
4576,We always travel First class where available as we appreciate the extra details. We booked our family vacation first class from LAX to Maui on AA after a four day stop over in Disneyland. We had an early morning ride to the airport from Disneyland and check in went smoothly. The agent directed us to priority screening and The Admiral Lounge to relax in while waiting for our flight. Once we got to the lounge they tried to charge us $50 per person for lounge access. Normally with a first class ticket lounge access is part of that cost on all the other airlines we travel with. Not with American Airlines. They just chipped away at customer value by that one action for our family and I would recommend not using them if possible.
4577,Flew New York to Las Vegas - October 22nd flight #45. IÂ´m really surprised that American is not considered Low Cost. First you must do your own check in and pay $25 for your first luggage. Second you have to paid extra if you want a comfortable seat. I paid $59 to stretch my legs and I choose the first row after business class. There was a division panel so in fact there wasn't much room. Third in 5 hours flight only 1 complimentary drink and if you want food have to pay for it. Fourth They promote the internet onboard but this is not free $4 for email and more if you want to surf the net. The flight boarded with 1 hour and half delay due to a problem with a luggage compartment door. Seated onboard for another hour and then half an hour waiting for our turn to take off after leaving the gate.
4578,"LHR-LAX. I bought the First Class fare to Las Vegas via LAX as it was quite good value for money and I knew I would be getting AAs new First Class product on the 777-300ER - it was certainly a better bet than BAs Club World on an ageing 747 - the only alternative. I avoided the AA Flagship lounge at LHR T3 as I had read so many bad reviews. The BA alternative was okay. The plane was brand new and the new seat was fine. There are only 8 seats in the AA 1st Class on this plane. Nothing spectacular. It was roomy good TV good seat controls and a neat feature was the rotation to face out of the window. Food was well just okay. Nothing very stylish. A trout timbale to start. A nice spicey butternut squash soup came next. Boring salad - seen better in M&S. Chicken main was - well okay. Had better in my local pub. FAs were friendly and called passengers by name. For the money it was acceptable. Certainly not worth $10-12000+ return which is often the regular list price to LAX. It lacks the ""class"" wow factor which should be obvious when you fly in first."
4579,"NRT-SIN on 788 (2-4-2 configuration) NH801 on 16 June. Return leg following SIN-NRT on 31 May on 788. Flight got re-timed by 30 minutes due to ""late arrival of aircraft"". Didn't appreciate it however since this is the final leg of my journey home and I was really tired as I did not sleep on my previous leg from YYZ (12 hours). I was trying to sleep on this flight but I couldn't as the seat was simply too uncomfortable: the fixed-shell non- reclining seat really deters against sleeping. As mentioned in my last review if you intend to stay awake this seat is good. If you intend to sleep and do not fall asleep easily steer clear. In-flight entertainment was still as good but I was too tired to appreciate it. Also the selection of music is quite limited."
4580,5/25/2014 Seattle-Tokyo-Ho Chi Minh City. Usually fly 2-3 long haul flights a year. First and last time on ANA- Dreamliner- big disappointment. Studied seat map carefully and picked 2x3x2 seat configuration-however after purchase aircraft was changed to 3x3x3 - sat in the middle. 9.5 hours in overheated cabin and extremely uncomfortable seat that barely reclines. The 767 portion has no recline and equally hard seats. The Dreamliner dedicates 2/3 of plane to First and Business cramming over one half of it's passengers in 1/3 of it's space. Expected more from a Japanese Airline.
4581,We flew from Bellingham to Palm Springs over the Christmas holidays. It snowed the day we were leaving we made it to the airport okay for the morning flight and waited for them to clear the runway. Allegiant kept delaying all day and in the end cancelled the flight. We had to spend almost 2 hours on the phone waiting for customer service to book us on a flight the next day which left in the afternoon. Again delayed over an hour and so we lost two days of our vacation. On the way back from Palm Springs we were delayed a couple of hours as well. The line to check in was ridiculous. Every other airline has multiple agents and no line-up.. Allegiant one or two agents and over an hour line-up (both ways). On the way down we were a couple of lbs. over the limit with the check-in luggage and they said no problem. On the way back they said even if you're 1 lb. over you have to take something out or they'd charge us. This is the one and only time I will ever fly with them.
4582,"LHR-ORD return I have come to the conclusion that AA are probably the worst Airline I have flown with. First of all the planes wouldn't look out of place in a museum I haven't seen such an antiquated IFE system since the 1990's - suspended CRT monitors and they have the gall to charge nearly $6 a head for headphones. The food is awful with no choice to speak of - breakfast on both flights was a choice between omelette or scrambled egg since my daughter will not eat egg dishes on the outbound flight we asked if they could provide an alternative were curtly told we should have ordered a special diet meal. On the return flight we upset the crew by taking my daughters breakfast on board with us. The final meal - no choice just pizza. On both flights it was served so late that no sooner had we opened our cutlery than we were begin badgered by give up our trays as the crew needed to prepare for landing. During the outbound flight having slept for four hours and with no response to the call button I walked back to the galley to request a drink for myself and my family only to be told ""You have run us all ragged on this flight so we have closed up the galley and are resting so you'll have to wait for the meal""."
4583,ITM-NRT. B737/800. Messy check-in. Separated security lane for Star Alliance Gold pax. Very poor Lounge however (no food) poor drinks. Boarding well done. Please was clean. No entertainment. No food. On time.
4584,We were scheduled to leave Grand Forks to Sanford Orlando on January 27th. We had a storm to drive through and highways were closed. We managed to reach the airport with little sleep and were boarded on our plane at 10.30am. We were onboard but were then taken off the plane due to a flat tyre. They told us they would try to fix the issue and then we were told that we were going to fly out that day. After waiting at the airport until 3.30pm they told us the flight was cancelled until the next day. They put us up in a hotel but only one room per booking. We were told we would leave at 8am then got bumped to 8.30am! Not impressed! Not sure if I would fly with them again.
4585,San Diego to Miami - seating was so tight I couldn't read a magazine when the seat in front of me reclined. Extra charges for everything. A truly horrible experience but it was non-stop and they were punctual.
4586,I feel cheated by ANA. When I booked in BC I could already make the seat reservation. ANA gave the 1-2-1 configuration indicating the latest horizontal seats. For my wife and I I booked the two middle seats on both legs NH206 and 205. At the airport I discovered a 2-3-2 configuration with the old sliding down seats! I was very angry and contacted ANA they replied that ANA has the right to change the configuration without notice to the passenger. The seat is one of the worst I have flown narrow very hard and sliding down! Sleeping almost impossible!
4587,Never again. We booked to travel from Manchester to Orlando. The aircraft in both directions was old cramped and uncomfortable. The temperature of the cabin was inconsistent. The entertainment was rubbish no seat back TVs which have always been a standard for all international flights that we have travelled on. The aisle TVs could not be seen from window seats which was pointless and dark sections of the movie could not be seen at all. Food was terrible my salad arrived uncovered and food was average. Ground crew were frantically trying to get people to give up seats flight was overbooked with many families not sitting together and children split from their parents on the flight! AA was not much cheaper than my other flight options. Avoid travelling with them!
4588,My husband and I have just flown with AA from LHR to MIA and back and was very disappointed at the poor service and the rude and off hand attitude of the cabin staff in economy. As former Cabin crew myself I was astonished at the poor and lack of service on board. On the outbound flight there was no service for over 2.5 hrs as turbulence was expected. There was no attempt at any service during this time and the meal and drink were almost flung at us. I don't recall being offered a hot drink! No more service until the snack service which was an undercooked pizza. Pretty basic for a 9 hr day flight the return flight was no better. No drinks were served with breakfast as more turbulence was expected! There was no turbulence - in my opinion the crew didn't leave themselves enough time to carry out a full service. Considering the cost of the flight and the other ways airlines have of extracting money from pax such as priority boarding and choosing seats etc I expected better service and at least some courtesy! We felt that the service we received was unsatisfactory. I will not be recommending American Airlines after our disappointing experience.
4589,Kobe-Chitose-Kobe. B737-800. No Star alliance lounge at Kobe. Star Alliance lounge at Sapporo/Chitose with special security way (very useful). Nice wines. no food at all! Paid but nice food onboard of both flights. Smiling staff every time. Very clean and nice aircraft. A good experience.
4590,AA is an embarrassment to US hospitality and service. I frequently fly business class transatlantic - have you tried to get past a neighbor who is lying flat to reach the aisle? It's almost impossible as the seats are so badly positioned and designed. And what about the Business lounge H at Heathrow the food available and decor are awful compared to any other major world airline - yes including some US competitors. Finally I am tired of the grumpy geriatric flight attendants that seem to dominate the ranks. All US airlines have lost ground compared to their European peers but AA is down at the bottom of the pile.
4591,SEA-NRT on the 787 which is a 10-hour flight. In the 3x3x3 configuration the seat was small and uncomfortable. The cabin was very hot which made it even worse. And my wife and I were separated because of the change in aircraft configuration. On a positive note the flight attendants were friendly and efficient and the selection of Hollywood movies was nice. The bathrooms were clean and the food was OK. But it's all about the seat. I can only recommend to small people who can tolerate hot cabin temperatures.
4592,Awful experience. The cabin crew are amongst the rudest least helpful people you are likely to come across in life. I was travelling with two small children 2years and 8months. Having spent the majority of the flight on my feet rocking my 8mth old to sleep she finally fell asleep. Breakfast arrived unfortunately I knocked the tray onto the floor. The member of cabin crew stepped over it ignoring it. When I apologised and asked for help to pick it up he curtly said he would get it later. The breakfast was strewn all over the floor in front of the toilet. I had a sleeping baby in my arms. When another passenger woke up half an hour later my fellow passenger was kind enough to pick the items up.
4593,My wife and I travelled overnight to Rome on AA on Oct. 1 from JFK. It was very disappointing. There were no in seat videos on the Boeing 767. The overhead screens continued to play movies until just before landing which prevented me form sleeping. The economy section food was uninspiring to say the least with stale dinner rolls and a wedge of cheese for dessert. This is our last international trip on AA.
4594,NRT-ITM. B767. 2-3-2 configuration. Good space for legs. Fast and efficient check-in. Bus boarding with separate bus for Priority pax. Big screen with front camera views including during take-off and landing. No individual screen. Paid drinks and food. Baggage arrived immediately. Cabin attendants just vanished.
4595,Over the last 6 years I have flown Allegiant 39 times - all PIE to FWA. with few exceptions I would rate them as good to very good however in the last 2 months (Dec 2013 - Jan 2014) the service has been deplorable! The last 3 flights I've taken with them have followed a similar pattern: 2 4 6 hour delays then cancel and re-book the next day. My sense is that they've grown too fast and their infrastructure can't keep up with their flights but it ultimately comes down to poor management. It's too bad - this was an excellent convenient flight. I'm now forced to look at other options.
4596,Feb 2nd 2014. Had a flight at 12 out of SYR got the 1 and only email saying the flight was delayed until 1.45. I get to the airport at 1 to have them tell me the plane hasn't left PIE (Clearwater) yet. We then didn't board until 4.45 sat on the plane until 5.30 until we finally took off. They served us 1 slice of cold pizza. We finally touched down at 8.30. I have a return ticket for this Thursday I purchased a ticket to fly United instead. Staff not friendly either. I will not fly Allegiant again.
4597,This was my first and last time with American Airlines. Booked with British Airways from Dublin to Orlando. Flight out was fine as it was with BA but return was with AA - as they are partners of BA I thought the service would be the same. How wrong I was - flight was 2.5 hours delayed which meant we missed our flight from Dublin to Glasgow. I had to pay Â£190 to rebook flights. We were only allowed 1 checked bag each but with BA we were allowed 2 each. The stewardesses only came round once with drinks service and you had to pay for spirits. Plane seemed old. No inflight entertainment system in the back of seat instead TVs that came down where everyone had to watch the same film. No leg room at all. Very narrow seats that were extremely uncomfortable. I never complain about anything and when I read the reviews before our flight I thought they were exaggerated but honestly it's the worst flight I have ever been on and I wouldn't fly with them again even if it was free.
4598,I flew from CDG to JFK on October 14th. It was the cheapest direct flight which was quite punctual. So the basis is 100% fulfilled. But the overhead compartment opened during take off and things fell down. It reopened during landing. When I left the plane I said it to the steward he did not ask me where it was located. Just something common. In addition to this half of the flight was in the dark because of an electric malfunction that prevented us calling for assistance. That is the visible part of the aircraft for the passenger. To fly in an old plane ok but it has to be nicely maintained.
4599,Flight from Narita to Seattle on Boeing Dreamliner. On the flight to Narita seats were 2 on outside 3 in the middle. Return flight different airplane seats 3 rows outside 3 in middle. It was the most cramped of any flight I have ever taken including domestic. An agonizing trip. The service is quintessentially Japanese: gracious efficient. It is just that 2/3 of the seats are taken up by almost totally empty business and first class seats. Even United was better in terms of comfort.
4600,Don't fly Allegiant day after Super Bowl two crews flying out of Phoenix Mesa failed to show up resulting in significant delays. AZA to GTF delayed at least 4 hours and counting. Weather fine at both ends of flight. Obviously no backup crews. Communication of delays is poor. Flights are inexpensive but airline may be operating over it's head. Could be an airline with a bright future if it can sort out it's operational issues. They did offer refreshments and food voucher after 2 hours of waiting.
4601,Always delays even when the plane is the first one out in the morning. Frequently when there are going to be weather delays the airline won't cancel so you can make alternative arrangement until you have sat all day waiting. I fly frequently and American always has some excuse for why they can't help their delays. Sick of this airline.
4602,"I was flying from Miami - Sao Paulo on AA929 on the 10th July 2014 on a 772ER in First. Having arrived from LAX 2 hours prior I was absolutely exhausted and was hoping to get some sleep on this leg. Boarding was smooth and the flight took off on time once the aircraft had reached cruising altitude and the seat belt sign was turned off I made my way to the galley and requested one of the two FA's (both were busy discussing their personal problems rather then attending to passengers) to turn down my bed I received a shocking impertinent response from her: ""So you want me to push a button for you"". Disgruntled and furious I prepared the bed myself and slept for the remainder of the flight. Around an hour before landing I was poked and woken up by the same rude flight attendant. At that point I expressed my frustration and told her she was not fit for purpose and shouldn't be working customer service orientated role. American Airlines has a good product in First (for a North American airline) I managed to sleep comfortably; however their poorly trained rude staff make it an unpleasant experience. Upon completing my flight I cancelled my return with AA and subsequently purchased a new flight with TAM which has a far superior product and customer service it's a shame they're suspending their first class on all routes from early next year."
4603,Flew from Sapporo to Haneda on a packed 777-300. Flight departed on time and arrived on time. Boarding was orderly but they allow too many carry on bags onboard the crew had a difficult time closing the overhead bins. As you can imagine 10 across seating is really cramped. Flight was about 1 hour 45 mins with no inflight entertainment except headsets for listening to music and scattered video monitors showing a Japanese documentary. Service wise was bad and minimal. Onboard for an hour and 45 min flight you are only offered water oolong tea and apple juice. No other drinks available not even orange juice. Asked the FA for ice and she just pointed to her drinks. For the price we paid as it was not cheap its definitely not worth it. For Japanese standard of service its appalling.
4604,October 9 2014 AA 137 DFW to HKG. Flight departed Dallas pretty much on time. Once airborne hot paper towels were distributed following by drink service. Complimentary beers and wine. Shortly after drink service lunch was served followed by another round of drink service. Special vegetarian meal was provided. Meal consisted of rice and chick peas curry with a side salad with olive oil dressing and two pieces of melon as desert. Tiny quantity but tasted decent and edible. About 7 or 8 hours into the flight a mid flight snack was served with drinks. Three pieces of vegetarian wraps and a fruit salad was served. Less than two hours before landing in Hong Kong another meal was served. This time the meal was a cold pasta salad with two pieces of cantaloupe melon. Flight was about a little over 16 hours. Seats in Main Cabin Extra were fairly comfortable. Flight crew was professional but lack the grace of Asian carriers flight crew. No other amenities were provided like other Asian carriers such as toothbrush socks eye masks etc. However a refreshments self service counter was set up in the galley and juices and water were available through out the flight. IFE was surprisingly good with many new movies and TV shows available on demand. No flight deck announcement but flight crew provided information in English Cantonese and Mandarin. All in all a satisfactory flight with inexpensive fare compared to Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines but nothing special. Flight crew did not attempt to make passengers feel particularly welcome nor rude to passengers. Better than expected.
4605,I recently flew from Chicago to Dublin Ireland on American Airlines - never again. The planes on both legs were filthy the toilets stank there was no individual IFE only shared screens on a 8.5 hour transatlantic flight the cabin crew were the rudest most unfriendly people I have ever met everybody sitting around me agreed. People had asked for blankets etc. but never got them. And to add insult to injury we were delayed 2.5 hours out of Dublin the crew didn't apologize and hit and the back so as to not have to deal with the passengers. If traveling from Chicago to Dublin I highly recommend either Aer Lingus or United. Both have good IFE their planes are clean and their staff are pleasant and accommodating. American Airlines in my opinion has gone downhill despite all their promises of improving their planes and services.
4606,"San Francisco to Tokyo (SFO-NRT) March 25 then NRT to SFO April 17 Flights 007 and 008. Serious decline in service since my last flight in July. This used to be a ""premium"" airline. Now it is no better than any others serving the same route and it's usually $200 more expensive. For many years ANA has been the last hold-out for old-fashioned ""Japanese hospitality."" No longer do you ""get what you pay for."""
4607,I recently flew from Niagara Falls NY airport down to Florida for a week. The plane we had was an older one no entertainment washroom could have been renovated. I felt this crew were not as professional as others I've observed. No coffee tea or water glad I had brought my own. We were a little late taking off because of de- icing. Upon coming back I was only a few lbs over with my luggage but got charged 50 dollars. There are too much add-ons for this airline. Overall this was the worst experience on a trip I've had.
4608,Flew with AA Flight 734 Miami to Philadelphia to connect to Manchester on 30th September. The outbound flights both with US Airways. AA refused point bank to help me book the seats for 734 when I rang the UK customer services. Both agents need a training course last one told me to arrange seats at airport. US Airways helped me with seats for my family on their 3 legs. I tried to log in to my flight the night before to book seats to together and found to my horror there were no seats together and I had no choice but to choose from the few left. Arrived at Miami and flight was showing on time. Shortly before take off it became a 30 minute delay. Many people waiting concerned as they had connections like us. Some had no boarding passes for their US airways flight as they could not print these on check in. Unhelpful lady at desk would not help meaning those without passes then had to go chasing around PHL airport to get passes printed. Flight landed 30 minutes late cue rush as the plane was packed and most had connections to make. We were lucky as our flight departed from Terminal A. Still it left no time to go to any shops or buy food and drink. For their abysmal customer service for refusing to help me but worse by far for the first time in my life having my entire family split up on a plane and having to sit with total strangers I will boycott AA. US Airways in contrast were very good and helpful. Goodbye AA they just don't seem to care anymore. Had to give 1 star for entertainment. Should be a 0 option as unless you pay you get nothing! Wifi? Oh yes pay for that as well!
4609,October 6th 2014 MIA-STT. American Airlines is a low budget airline at best with premium airline prices. The service that American Airlines provide is on par with Spirit Airlines and Ryanair. Why pay so much to get there when someone else gets you there for less with same level of service.
4610,I have not flown for a long time but I must say I was very disappointed. I took a trip from Tampa Florida to Boston MA and twice fights were delayed. It's a shock to me that airlines charge so much to fly and then your experience is so poor. In this day and age delays should not be happening for this amount of time. I cannot consider them again.
4611,NH 009 JFK-NRT. No wheelchair for 80 year old mother. No kids meal loaded its ok - mistakes happen. But when mistakes happen the inflight crew should not be blaming travel agents or ground staff. They even promised to ensure everything would be taken care of for the return. A simple confirmation call to the reservations center made me realize nothing was taken care of. Flight attendant even asked if I could speak in Japanese since English was obviously not a strength.
4612,Have flown Allegiant about 12 times and have had only 1 on time departure. Our last flight was 1/26 from PIE to AVL. Over 5 hours late. Equipment issues. Worst part is that even though it had an Allegiant flight # it was flown by Falcon Air. Both plane and crew were Falcon. When we checked in we were told that it was a chartered flight.
4613,I took a flight from Phoenix to Miami with Nassau Bahamas my final destination. I was extremely disappointed in the first class service. On a 3.5 hour flight we were offered one glass of either wine or water and twice a snack. Granted it was a red eye flight regardless the service should have at least offered a breakfast and coffee/tea. We landed at 7.30 Miami time which is long past morning coffee. This is the second time I took this flight and won't travel it again.
4614,Flew from Manchester to New York and it was by far the worst airline I've ever flown with. Old tired plane with aisle screens - shocking when flying international. I couldn't even listen to the film as something had broken off inside where I was meant to plug in my earphones. The flight attendants response? 'Oh I'm not sure what I can do about that.' Disgusting customer service. The so called 'entertainment' consisted of 1 film then American programmes that I've never even heard of then it was turned off altogether 2 hours before we landed! The staff were very abrupt and just looked fed up - the food was hands down the worst I've ever had on a flight.
4615,This is the first time in about 15 years that I have flown AA. Never again! This airline doesn't care about customer service. Our flight out of DFW was delayed 4.5 hrs. Never was there an announcement. The gate changed 5 times. The flight being delayed was never addressed. DFW airport at AA is absolutely awful. While sitting for 5 hours and speaking to other passengers we found out the majority of flights were delayed for some reason or other. There were few if any gate representatives around. Nothing was explained to anyone.
4616,On the Tokyo (Narita) to Fukuoka segment ANA uses an ancient A320. The interior was upholstered in a deep green which does not even resemble the current ANA blue colour. The plane definitely had a retro feel. Moreover it was nearly empty. 20 pax on a 166 seat plane. Thankfully it's a short commuter flight. They could jazz up the whole experience though and make those 90 minutes a bit more exciting.
4617,For this 90 min shuttle flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo - Haneda ANA packs in the seats fitting 405 seats on an old 777-200. That's the dreaded 10 seats abreast. Thankfully the flight was not full so we could spread out. The service is minimal as is the interior design giving this flight a truly bus-like feel. I know these flights are meant to be practical but why do they have to also make them boring?
4618,Maiden trip from PIE to SWF on 10/31/13. On time definitely a no frills airline. Stewards and stewardesses complained the whole trip about having a 4hr layover. Now the return trip: My flight was scheduled for a timely departure! Approx 7.30pm that meant being there by 5.30. Never received text alert and airport screens showed on time schedule. An announcement was finally made at 7.15pm of the delay we would hopefully be boarding after it arrived at gate at 9.15-9.30. After arriving after midnight I still had a 2 hr drive home. I can usually fly back and forth with just a personal item but rudeness is unacceptable. Everything is an added fee: seat water snack carry on checked bag priority seating etc.
4619,I recently flew from Greenville to Clearwater and both legs the plane left three hours late with weather not being a factor. On stepping out in Greenville I inquired to the people who were waiting to fly on how long they had been waiting they said 4 hours.
4620,Traveled with AA MIA to SFO and return. Oct 1st and 5th. 738 on the first leg. 5.5 hr min flight one beverage service offered. Return flight 757 and 2 beverage services offered. Pay extra for better cabin seats pay to check a bag and hardly a smile. Really felt like cattle and not a pleasant experience. Waited for one hour to receive bags on the return arrival in Miami. It is truly a shame to see the deterioration of service in the industry and the total lack of customer care.
4621,Over crowded flight. They actually overbooked. Had 2 hour delay and another hour delay on the connecting flight. Had to literally run to the connecting gate due to such a late arrival the gates were very far apart. Plane was filthy. I don't think they clean them ever. Seats are small and uncomfortable. Can't even fully open the tray tables. I'm not a large person and I was unable to do it so I'm sure large people can't use them at all. However they do have tablets built into the seats but you can't do much on them unless you pay a high fee. Will not fly with American Airline again.
4622,My Wife and I flew 28th Sept Vancouver to DFW to Orlando Business/First. Breakfast omelette cold sent back asked for a second warm scone instead! We were not the only pax to send the cold omelettes back. Admiral Club in DFW refused us entry. Never refused entry into Airline lounges before showing First/Business class tickets? My Priority Pas came to the rescue allowing me entry into a different lounge at DFW. The staff seemed very disinterested in what was going on and this includes a non existent cabin check prior to landing at Orlando. Will never waste my Dollars on First/Business on American domestic flights in the future. Nearly forgot - had to pay for wi-fi!
4623,HKG-HND paid full price for economy ticket yet got an awful seat in a separate partitioned area of 2 rows right behind business class. About 5 or 6 babies in the vicinity all crying at various intervals. Furthermore seat was incredibly uncomfortable - not the regular seats but the seat cushion is shorter and dips down in the center putting pressure on thighs. When I asked to change seats FA just brushed me off even though there were a couple empty seats elsewhere. The IFE? Tiny low res screen audio was on/off due to ageing headphone input jack.
4624,"Original flight was from LGA to DFW. After flying in circles in the air for half an hour we finally re-routed to land in Little Rock Arkansas. We sat on the runway in the plane for at least two hours with no offerings of good or water even after the 4 hour flight. I understand completely this is weather related and only looking out for our safety however this was not handled well at all. When asking the stewardess for water- it's like it was a huge inconvenience. We finally deboard the plane in Arkansas and were told to wait around to see if the flight is officially cancelled - an hour later it was. Hotel rooms were not offered to be paid for not even a meal or anything at all. Everyone paid out of pocket and waited to de board the next morning. Back at the airport at 6am and we were told to use our old boarding passes and go directly to security- they refused us and made is wait back in the long American Airlines line to get a new boarding pass. My final destination was Austin which was also cancelled. They put me on a flight to Houston in first class which was unexpected. However I decided to just rent a car and drive to Austin from Dallas but I was told that there was no possible way to get my bag because it was listed as priority to Houston. Well our flight from Arkansas to Dallas was delayed an hour then the flight from Dallas to Houston was delayed another hour. First class wasn't anything special honestly more leg room and drinks served in glass instead of plastic. Finally arrive in Houston waiting at baggage claim and guess what - my bag isn't there. I was told it was on the next flight coming in from Dallas which infuriated me after I wanted to originally take my bag in Dallas as it was. Waited around the airport for another hour or so and finally get my bag with a big orange sticker on it saying ""priority"". Yeah right. Never will fly American again."
4625,JFK-LAX First class. Good but not overwhelming as it should be. Seat on A321 is good but has some problems very hard to get out or in while even partly reclined. Food was mediocre in quality although presented nicely. Flight crew was wonderful but honestly the whole experience is either over priced or under done. Jet Blue Mint on my outbound was much better.
4626,Ignoring that the flight was late and meant I had to get a bus to Haneda from Narita to make my connection the SIN-NRT sector on ANA's 787 was immensely uncomfortable. The seats are the 'shelled' non-reclining type and are advertised as having a seat pitch of 34 inches but in practice I was only able to slide my seat forward an inch or so before my knees jarred into the seat-back in front. The result was 7 hours of night flight in a lot of discomfort and any suspected benefit of flying in a 787 totally lost. Staff were unerringly polite and IFE was good but both of these positives were overwhelmed by the discomfort. Why have ANA gone this route when their CX peers had already paid the price and fallen on the 'rigid economy seat' sword? Madness.
4627,Flew from NRT to SIN. 7 hours flight but there was only one meal. The same flight on United serves 2 meals. The meal was good though with pictures illustrating what to choose. Plenty of refills of warm Japanese green tea. My major complaint is the small seats. The plane was the new Dreamliner 787 but the seats are clearly designed for Japanese people with legroom significantly less than that of United and other US carrier. It is quite hard to get out if you are stuck in a middle seat. I do like the spray toilet in the bathroom. Good service overall but definitely not the most comfortable flight.
4628,A group of 5 of us paid $145 total to be able to select our seats. On our flight from St. Pete's to Lex we were told it was open seating with no seat assignments. We had paid in advanced for a seat assignment. This made it very difficult for groups with small children.
4629,Last night I flew from O'Hare to Dublin Ireland with American Airlines. I am a seasoned transatlantic traveler and have flown all airlines from North American to either Shannon or Dublin Ireland. On boarding the 767-200 aircraft I was astonished that there was no AVOD on the place only the large overhead screens which went out 15 years ago. Everybody sitting around me was annoyed as we all had to watch the same movies for the 7.5 hour flight. It is probably going to be the same on the 8.5 return flight - never again American Airlines.
4630,"AA104 JFK-LHR 20 Sept - Long queues at ""Priority"" Check-in at Kennedy thirty minute wait as agents struggled to help passengers from strike-bound Air France. TSA security a shambles (not the airlines fault). Admiral's Club a little crowded but a haven. Greeted by smilingly efficient desk staff. Bartender knew the drill two stiff Grey Goose and Tonics swiftly dispensed (but cheap and nasty plastic glasses?) Boarding was smooth and quick cabin crew a tad overwhelmed trying to stow overhead bins on this full to bursting flight. Main Cabin Extra (19D) seat would be well worth the small surcharge but complimentary to Ruby and above frequent flyers anyway. Great IFE OK food dished out promptly after take-off. Croissant juice and coffee before early Heathrow arrival. Bags already delivered by the time I got to the belt. From being the third world poor relation of the Oneworld Alliance American seem to be vastly improved; new aircraft and good service at an excellent price. My next transatlantic trip with them (to Chicago in November) is on a 767 with a retro 25 year old cabin fit though - watch this space."
4631,Recently flew DUB-ORD - 22 year old 767 ORD-LAX-SFO 737's SFO-LAX-LHR 737 and new 777. Apart from the fact that I got there and back safely I must say what a disappointment the airline is in terms of inflight entertainment comfort staff and food/drinks. I fly regularly from the UK mainly East on EU/Asian airlines or within Europe and I now realise how spoilt we are here. When comparing AA to QR EK etc they just do not compare in any regard. The old 767 aircraft in a very tired state still had analogue buttons for their armrest music entertainment system and huge drop down crt displays. Food was awful and very poor quality on takeoff. The pre-landing snack a deep dish pizza was much better albeit on the greasy side. Domestic US services were on 737's - one with the new sky interior and 2 older interiors. All perfectly fine to get me from point A to B. Plenty of rather expensive food purchase options in the terminals and ability to bring food on board was good. I did not think much of the in- flight food menu for purchase - limited choice and not great quality it would seem. Nice touch for in-flight wi-fi although I didn't use it. The biggest disappointment and a real embarrassment was the supposed 'flagship American service' from LAX-LHR. Super cramped seating in 10 abreast layout in economy meant no elbow room whatsoever. Very poor in-flight entertainment system - hard to navigate difficult to find music titles plus generally limited selection. The catering was shockingly poor for dinner a chicken dish which was flavourless and served with a salad with grated cheese and dressing some crackers with cheese spread a biscuit for dessert and a cold and chewy roll. Breakfast was similarly disappointing and consisted of a yoghurt orange juice and a horrible leathery croissant served with jam and butter. A continental breakfast on a service between the states and the UK? Where is the sausage and eggs? Even Qatar give the above and a hot dish as their breakfast in better quality. The embarrassment really comes with the announcement at the start of the flight where we are introduced and welcomed to their 'flagship' service. It is laughable. On a plus note the drinks service was perfect. Crew were very hit and miss on all sectors. 767 is way above the 777 in terms of comfort and space. I would much rather have 9 abreast in a 777 or a 22 year old 767 then this flagship 777. Good USB/power options though - that's probably the only thing that they got right on AA136. I would go out of my way to avoid AA in future unless price is the only factor.
4632,Returning from Las Vegas on Jan 6 2014. Got to the Las Vegas airport and was told the flight was delayed by 4 hours due to pilot being timed out. Does Allegiant never have any stand by staff? By the looks of the gate that day all Allegiant flights were very delayed. The weather was fine so very little in the way of excuses for them. I doubt I will ever fly Allegiant again as this is the 3rd time with problems.
4633,We were group of 8 travelling on December 26 flight 221 from Bellingham to Las Vegas. Told that flight was cancelled - Allegiant offered hotel vouchers to passengers who lived 50 miles away. Allegiant didn't have any service personnel at Bellingham airport who could help with re-routing to get to destination only way was over the phone with long wait. Allegiant accepted all passengers who wanted to continue on flight next day. We all lost one day of paid hotel accommodation and one day of paid 2 rental cars. Return was a little less disrupted just delayed for one hour and 20 min. Reason was 'they didn't have crew for airplane'. We all decided that Allegiant is going to be last choice in our travelling due to unreliability.
4634,Would not fly this airline. Unprofessional delays maintenance issues above the norm old equipment timed out crews not enough backup equipment or crews. I experienced all of above on an attempted flight to Lex Ky from Sanford Fl.
4635,Manchester to Las Vegas via Chicago. I currently live in Dubai and travel quite frequently using Emirates so I have probably been spoilt. The planes we flew on with American from the outside looked very modern however once we boarded things were very different. The interiors were outdated and looked like they had been in use since the 70's the interior was dull and the seats were like something out of a scrap yard mine was actually broken from were the trolleys had banged into it coming down the aisles. None of the economy seats had single televisions which I just could not believe for a long haul flight! Only business class are given portable tablets to watch the entertainment. The food was very poor and tasteless and the flight crew were bickering between themselves from take off to landing. I was extremely disappointed with this airline and I have vowed never to fly with them again please be warned as we spent a lot of money on this holiday only to be left disappointed by this carrier.
4636,Business class seat on the staggered B777 config. NRT-BKK route. The seat only seemed to offer 2 positions upright or lie flat. Not a comfortable seat and somewhat out of date. IFE selection was not as expansive as other airlines and the controls were not particularly responsive. Food service was geared to the Japanese pax. The overall meal presentation was beautiful in typical ANA fashion but nothing on offer was particularly appealing to me. I opted for a stewed piece of meat wrapped in a finely minced type of hamburger. It was not particularly palatable with an emphasis upon bland. It was inedible. Cabin service was directed at the Japanese pax while I felt ignored. FAs were professional but I was ignored having to ask for a refill on a drink or coffee. It isn't the first time I have had this experience on ANA and yet  it is something I only experience on ANA and never on any other Asian carrier. I don't know why this airline merits 5 stars as nothing on the flight was exceptional or not done in a better fashion on several of ANA's lower rated competitors in the region.
4637,Travelled last week from Vancouver to Lima via Dallas on a paid business class fare. Entire experience was a huge disappointment the flight crews were indifferent seats were uncomfortable especially in the 757's from DFW to Lima. Did not get my pre ordered meal on the Lima - DFW return. As a business class passenger the Admirals Club at DFW was underwhelming. Had to pay for water. Will travel any other airline unless there is no other option. What a horrible product.
4638,I flew with American Airline from CDG to NYC and was outraged by the aircraft used a 757 with a very uncomfortable Biz Class old seats and basically an outdated aircraft. The inflight service was just OK and it is far from the standards used by American when flying to Asia. On the return trip it was a 767 and the experience was as awful as the way in. There is no comparable Biz Class in any Major European airlines American should rethink their product and services approach on these routes. Pathetic!
4639,Fight #1636 from Miami to Washington DC on Friday September 24 delayed for an hour due to the problem in Chicago then sat for 1.5 hrs inside the plane with no AC due to a maintenance issue. Typical of this airline - being treated like cattle.
4640,I flew from Seattle-Narita-Singapore and then back through San Francisco. I'm writing to warn people about the new 3-3-3 economy seat 787 configuration. In short it was the single most uncomfortable flight of my life. I had a window seat and I was jammed in under the curvature of the airplane. The service food and entertainment were excellent but the terrible tiny seat overshadowed everything else. In Narita I switched planes to a 787 with the old 2-4-2 configuration and it was like moving to business class. I recommend inquiring what configuration you will ride prior to booking - the 3-3-3 is quite bad.
4641,Narita to Hong Kong in Business. Very disappointed with our 4.5 hour flight on 28 December. Our first ANA experience and we had high expectations. Check in was very good but went downhill from there. Was directed to the United lounge which is cavernous but poor selection of food for breakfast. On board the 767 the seats had limited recline which made sleeping difficult. Biggest disappointment was the food. I had high hopes for the Japanese selection but what I was offered for lunch was bland and poorly presented. My wife wanted the international menu (no choice) but was advised it had run out even though we were seated in the second row. No cheese or fruit was available as a substitute. The over the top apology from the chief cabin supervisor was embarrassing. No amenities kit. Cathay is streets ahead of this airline and I did not understand on this outing why it is 5 stars.
4642,Fort Myers FL on Dec 26 flight was delayed going to Knoxville TN and I returned home at 1.30 this morning. This is by far the worst airline I have used. In the past 3 years we have traveled Allegiant over 30 times and each trip it has become a joke. They are never time staffed or polite. I am currently waiting on a flight I received an email this morning telling me that the 2.30pm flight was being delayed until 11.30pm. I have since tried to check for updates online and by calling the customer service line. After waiting an hour and twenty minutes to speak to the customer service rep she told me that the flight should still be leaving at 11.30pm.
4643,On a flight from Grand Forks North Dakota to Sanford Florida this past December 2013 my flight was canceled. We sat on the tarmac for an hour while they figured out what was wrong and another 30 minutes locating the part and trying it again. Finally they determine they could not fix it. Well the next day they had it fixed. However they determined the plane was too cold for the passengers so we had to wait for them to warm it up. Once they warmed it up they determine the water was frozen in lavatories. So the only guy working had to get several pitchers of hot water to try to unfreeze the sinks but to no avail. Finally he said to use the hand wipes so we boarded and finally took off. I had bought the trip-flex and used it to change/extend my return flight since I was delayed a day. However you can't change it online you have to call in. Well it seems that this cheap airline is cheap in labor and maintenance.
4644,Recently returned from a trip down to Florida originating from Niagara Falls NY over the holidays. Our flight was scheduled to depart from Niagara Falls IAG airport at 11.57 am on Dec 23 2013. Arrived early only to find out that our flight had been delayed an hour. We purchased food at the airport cafe while we waited. Around 12.30 pm we were told that the plane was being re-routed to Ohio due to poor visibility and our flight would be further delayed. We had to wait a further 2 hours before boarding at 5.30 pm due to outstanding paperwork on the plane. We did not receive timely or detailed updates during this 5.5 hour delay. Not knowing when our flight was going to depart passengers including ourselves were forced to purchase food and beverages multiple times from the airport cafe and vending machines. When we finally did take off at 6.15 pm (6 hours later than our scheduled departure) we were offered complimentary snacks and beverages on the flight. I had hoped that our return trip would be redeeming for Allegiant however I was once again disappointed. Our return flight from Punta Gorda (PGD) to Niagara Falls (IAG) on Dec 28 was scheduled for 3.30 pm. Arrived at the airport at 1.30 pm only to be notified by the check-in counter that our flight had been cancelled. Told our flight would be rescheduled but it could be anytime the next day. We did not receive any notification until 12.55 am. Our flight had been rescheduled to 1.44 pm on Dec 29 so once again we repurchased food for the flight and drove another hour from Naples to Punta Gorda. Prior to boarding (at 1.25 pm) we were told by the representative that since the chartered plane had a different seating plan than the regular Allegiant planes passengers can seat themselves anywhere regardless of whether they paid extra and pre-ordered seats or not. In addition upon going to the restroom on the plane I was shocked to find that there was no running water in the washroom and we could not wash our hands.
4645,My family flew round trip from Rockford IL to Punta Gorda FL over the 2013 holidays. Our trip to Punta Gorda went very well. I am blind and one of the flight attendants came up to me as soon as I got seated with my family and offered me a personal safety briefing which I gladly accepted. The seats on the airplane (a Boeing MD80) weren't that comfortable and did not recline and there was no hot coffee available for purchase. The crew were professional and we got from point A to point B safely. On our return trip we were diverted at the last minute to Moline (2 hours away by car) because of freezing rain in Rockford. According to what passengers were told later we were unable to land in Rockford because there was a plane stopped on the runway and there was not sufficient room for us to land safely. On our arrival at the diversion airport the flight attendant working the forward cabin went through the usual post-flight announcements even going so far as to tell passengers not to smoke until they were outside the terminal to claim our luggage at the baggage claim area and how to book future travel on Allegiant. Upon our arrival at the gate we were informed?”that in addition to the weather in Rockford our plane had a mechanical problem. Passengers were sent into the airport and told that further information would be provided to them when it became available. The flight attendant showed no sympathy. The Allegiant representative at Moline was wonderful. There was little information available about when?”or even if?”the plane would be repaired and sent back to Rockford. As we were leaving the airport the gate agent announced that the plane had been fixed and that anyone wishing to go to Rockford should go back to the boarding area. The real issue for me was the lack of professionalism from the crew on our return flight. I might have been willing to overlook the diversion and mechanical problems if the crew had been sympathetic calm and professional. But everything on the return flight added up to a never-again??experience.
4646,I flew on 23rd Sept.2014 on AA291 from Dublin to New York and after over 30 years flying with American I can say the airline is in deep trouble the staff obviously did not care about the passengers and if that is what happens in business class I feel sorry for economy class which is a cattle truck anyway. No water offered no wine offered no announcement about baggage pick-up at JFK. You had to ask for everything and the body language was why are you bothering us.
4647,I had to take my parents to the airport today to fly from SEA to JFK. We were on Alaskan Airlines flight powered by American Airlines. They were early to the airport for check-in at Alaska but got directed to go to American Airlines because for some reason we needed to check in there. The Alaskan Airlines employees were very cheerful and eager to help. Then when we showed up to American Airlines we were not even able to check-in even though they had 43 minutes before takeoff. They were 2 minutes late for automated check in. Then they had to wait in another line which gave them another flight which added an extra stop in Dallas. This changed their travel time from 5.5 hrs originally to a 9 hr journey. We had to accept even though we tried to plead them to get them on the original flight. The terrible thing is that they got to their standby gate 15 minutes earlier than the original flight was going to take off. And by no means are my parents fast people even with the normal lines in TSA. They could have made their original flight! I will never do third party travel sites again and the stupid confusion on flights was terrible.
4648,Flew last month business class JFK-CDG. Flight delayed almost 4 hours announced 1 hour prior to departure. The attendant in the lounge told me we were lucky we had a plane. After boarding I was told the seat was not operational there was a barely visible sticker. But they did not know to what degree. The pilot had to look it up in his log. This took some 30 minutes. Verdict seat does not recline at all! They moved me to the back an arms reach from the coach bathroom. Each time someone went in and came out door slamming flash of light. There were 2 other much more desirable seats 4 AB it turned out those were for the staff. AA knows this are undesirable seats and it does not book them for their employees. The service on AA compared to other airlines is pitiful. With a few exceptions they treat you like they are doing you a favor. You never see a smile. The food most of the time is just plain bad. Due to the delay I almost missed my connection. After arriving to my final destination I found out that my luggage did not make it they found it 2 days later. Due to having to file paperwork for the missing luggage I missed my connection. AA is trying to blame it on the other airline.
4649,On Dec 29th our flight from Mesa to Missoula was canceled at 6am one hour prior to our departure with no reason given. We were assured that airline representatives would be available to help us get rebooked. They did not appear for two hours and we ended up standing in line for three hours to get our hotel vouchers. No one seemed to know what was going on. This was my first flight with Allegiant Airline and I was greatly disappointed.
4650,This is my first and last time to fly AA. Booked my vacation 6 months in advanced for Sunday to Sunday in the Dominican Republic. Arrived on Sunday morning to find out AA switched our flight to their sister company US Airways. Went to US airways to check in and they had no record of the switch. Went back to AA and after a search located our reservation. However this took so long that we missed our flight and they didn't have anything else going out on that day. They rebooked us for Monday morning and tried fixing it with $200 voucher (my non refundable room was $300 plus missing a day of vacation). On Monday morning (5.15 am flight) we showed up and checked in and got on the plane it is now 6.15 am and we are still sitting at the gate because an exterior light is out. You would thing they could have fixed it overnight. Anyway no matter how the rest of the flight goes they can't change my mind about the low scores on this review.
4651,"We flew Economy from SeaTac to Narita in October 2012 on the 787 and the flight seating was comfortable enough. The in-flight entertainment was excellent and the food & service very good. This year we took the same ANA Economy flight from SeaTac to Narita in October 2013 and the flight seating was terrible. In the past year ANA has changed the main Economy seating configuration from 2-3-2 to 3-3-3 and reduced the amount of space between seat rows to squeeze in more ""sardines into the same can"". It is so tight that the person directly in front has to move their seat to the upright position to adequately allow the food trays to fit onto the very small fold out tray. As well the newly instituted one (1) suitcase rule is very inadequate for those of us going for extended trips. Since the return flight home was re-directed to Portland OR due to ""fog/visibility problems"" at SeaTac and a series of subsequent problems our flight finally arrived ~8 hours late and this afforded an opportunity to speak with many other passengers. I found that many/most other passengers in the Economy cabin were of the same general opinion and would now strongly consider other options for their next trip. Options including flying to SF or Vancouver to get a more comfortable flight. ANA had a good product and through these changes of seat configuration has now given other carriers offering direct flights to Japan an excellent opportunity to compete and beat. We are now ""in-play"" and will not take another ANA flight to Japan w/o first understanding more about the seating arrangement. We did try to upgrade in Narita to Premium Economy but were allowed to do that; since they said we had a ""discount ticket"" i.e. tickets purchase through a Travel Agency and we paid what they asked. Not a good experience!"
4652,I was scheduled to leave on Thursday at 3:05 PM (august 28 2014). I was called by American and notified that my flight was delayed out of San Diego so my connections would be missed. American then rescheduled me for a flight the following day at 8:30pm (over 29 hours after the departure date I had scheduled). I then called American and got them to put me on the original flight that was delayed and move my connecting flights. My plan was to just sleep in Chicago and fly from Chicago to London and London to Nice the following day. After taking the original delayed flight I got a hotel in Chicago for 200$ because the flight out the next day was not until 5:05pm. 5 hour delay on the flight from Chicago to London - over 2 hours were on-board sitting at the gate. I missed the connection from London to Nice and they put me on another flight which was also delayed 1 hour. I finally arrived in Nice over 24 hours later than the ticket I purchased. On the way back to San Diego everything went smoothly except my luggage did not make one of my connections. I finally got them to deliver the bag 56 hours after I landed.
4653,Most frustrating travel experience traveled from DC to Honolulu trip planned paid for fewer stops and earlier arrival leaving DCA boarded plane on time then proceeded to sit on a boarded full plane for 1.5 hours because there was an overlooked routine mechanical issue preventing the plane from regulating the cabin temperature. Missed connection gave me a ticket including two stops and no talk of partial refund just a condescending align. Fast forward 1 week and again we're delayed by 2hrs in Honolulu. If you value your time do not fly American airlines.
4654,The seats! Took an overnight flight from Yangon to Narita and experienced the fixed seats - an unsuccessful attempt at fooling passengers into believing that they can sit in a relaxed position. Service and food were good but given the options out there it's no more ANA for me.
4655,"I don't fly with American Airlines much anymore but I flew them to Seattle for Thanksgiving so flights were busy. I was in the very last row (row 32) of an MD-80 - it was noisy back there. My aunt was carrying our babies car seat which had food inside it it dropped into the first class aisle and one of the FA's glared at us and said ""you're dropping food!"" I mean really and she didn't even offer to help carry it? Fortunately a courteous passenger came and helped. Flight Attendant in coach was a lot nicer she even gave us some food for free after she saw how stressed we were. Then the return flight was cancelled because they could not get the hangar door open so American Airlines gave us some Hotel Vouchers. After getting back to the airport American Airlines gave us seats in First Class to make up for the bad night we had free food with larger seats and more legroom was ok but it was just not enough. We were tired and wanted to get home after landing back in Charlotte we had to deal with riding a packed bus to get back to the Long Term parking lot. This was the most tiring trip I have ever had for a domestic flight."
4656,"9/10 from West Palm Beach to SNA 2.35pm connection in Chicago missed the 5.10 connection. Flight was delayed and missed connection - reason ""it happens traffic"". When I miss my flight because of traffic American charges passengers we should have vouchers for every time an Airlines misses timelines."
4657,LHR-MIA-GRU and GRU-JFK. Very quiet plane and cheery crew London to Miami Miami to Sao Paulo delayed about 90 minutes and crew a bit more grumpy. But they were sunny by comparison with the miserable team who took us up from GRU to JFK - good job there was superb IFE on a brand new plane (with disco lighting) to make up for it. I don't the cardigans and ties at half-mast helped. Having said that the AA/Oneworld staff at JFK did a great job in helping me transfer in about 30 minutes in order to catch a BA flight back to LHR.
4658,Reasonably well-organized. Purchasing online was easy. Received email update when departure time changed. Flight was on time both directions. However employees could be a little more attentive. The gate attendant in Mesa was brusque. I was 'blessed' to sit beside someone with a dog - and that person was also traveling with family who had a very small child located elsewhere on the plane. The dog was whiny - as was the child and the adults were not terribly successful in quieting either. Even though there was considerable disruption in my row no attempt was made by the flight attendants to placate those other passengers who were affected. Sadly with the exception of the safety information and selling food and drinks (oh and walking through with a trash bag) they were rarely seen. Yes I'll likely use them again - but only because of the airports they serve.
4659,Usually fly oneworld carriers. Last flight on American was a complete disaster. Boarded on time and it took 2 hrs before take off no explanation given until we left the gate. Very old 757. They said maintenance. Still some FA appeared on board before departing. Once airborne no service on a 4hr flight to SJU from JFK only food for purchase. FA rude and not professional. Arrived very late. It took more than 45 min to get luggage.
4660,"SEA-DFW-MIA-MVD both ways flights. I had low expectations based on previous trips on this route with this airline. Even when the 767 airplanes they are using on the MIA-MVD route are old beaten down and the business class seating is at the minimum acceptable level the price matches what one can consider a ""budget trip"". However I could smell unpleasant odors from the bathrooms both ways from MVD while seating on row 3 in business class. This may not be acceptable to any business class passenger I must say. Also I verified that bathrooms were not cleaned by the staff. Perhaps some disinfecting towels would do passengers can clean the bathrooms by themselves and help with the smell. Anything but making your stomach revolt when having your dinner or breakfast in business class. I sincerely hope that American Airlines replace their aircraft on the MIA-MVD route as soon as possible with more suitable modern aircraft."
4661,"Flt 986 St Thomas to Miami. ATC Delay in Miami (didn't tell us why but probably weather) not AA fault. Our aircraft left Miami for St Thomas returned due to medical emergency not AA fault. Aircraft arrived St Thomas and we departed 7.40pm (instead of 2.58pm) not AA fault. Arrived Miami and after 3 hours standing in line because in spite of knowing the flight was delayed four hours no one checked hotel room availability. We received meal vouchers for dinner ($12 and the restaurants were closed) voucher for hotel room (received at 2am waited 35 minutes for a van to a Holiday Inn had to be back at 5 to take advantage of the breakfast voucher $6 before the 7.14am flight to Dallas). Try to buy dinner for $12 or breakfast for $6 at Miami international. While we were in line no movement for over an hour because no one had checked room availability. Two attendants initially handling the entire rebooking for the flight. After over an hour another showed up at an adjacent gate. Shortly 'Denise' decided it was time for her to leave. She was 'supposed to leave twenty minutes ago"". Extremely poor planning overall. Poor accommodation after the fact. This is becoming the typical customer service quality for American and is really disappointing."
4662,"LAX-DFW-ATL AA2410 1 Sep 14. S80 ancient aircraft. Very uncomfortable seats. Almost one-hour delay in DFW because of ""broken-seat"" paperwork. Delay in landing at ATL because we lost our gate. Slow baggage handling. Staying away from AA for a year or so."
4663,We flew from Manchester to New York at the end of August as a couple. We were surprised to be automatically allocated leg-room seats by an emergency exit at no extra cost. However we were extremely surprised and disappointed to be on a very old plane (still old logo) and had no personal TV screens for a long haul flight! I have never encountered this before. We could also barely see the shared TV screens. Only one film of two was shown. The air hostesses were distracted tired looking and talking amongst themselves for much of the flight. It felt like an internal AA flight. All the same was exactly true for our return flight but furthermore they could not seat us together on our wedding anniversary. If this is how UK Manchester customers are treated (the same surely can't be true flying out of London!) then prices should reflect the poor service. Avoid AA if at all possible.
4664,LAX-HND on Boeing 777. ANA used to be one of my favorites I was a bronze member in 2010 and 2011. It has steadily declined since the mid 2000s and its economy class should now be considered solely for Japanese people wedded to Japanese airlines. It combines the worst of an American-style approach (cut costs to the bone) with the worst of Japanese service (absolutely no independent thought/action on the part of flight attendants and no exceptions. I recently had to endure pain for an entire 12+ hour flight for a reason that would have been easily remedied by a flight attendant on another airline. Economy seats are terribly cramped food is cheap and primarily carbohydrates (bread/rice) flight attendants have poor English skills and English-language video offerings are lacking. On the positive side flight attendants are polite smile a lot and apologize for their mistakes. You don't necessarily need to avoid it but given a choice between ANA and another major Asian or US airline choose the other airline.
4665,I flew early September 14 from Kuala Lumpur to Hartford CT return. The quality was very uneven. From KL to Hartford it was okay. On the long parts (KL to Frankfurt Frankfurt to Charlotte) we were given two meals and a snack. The meals were okay but I was disappointed on the snack which was cookies and chocolate. Of course no menu as with Etihad and Qatar. I know I know I chose the airline because of the low price. I was even more disappointed on the trip back. On the flight from Chicago to London the seats and space were so tight we could barely move. The plane looked old and shabby. It still had those communal TV!. Come on! On a 7-hour flight? Those things were so outdated! The flight from Heathrow was much better. It's the new A380. Still food was not much better. By the way flights from KL to Europe and Europe to KL were operated by Malaysian Airlines but the ones from Europe to US and vice versa were by AA. Overall I wouldn't recommend taking AA flying from Asia to US.
4666,"LAS-DFW-LGA-YUL. All flights were smooth and on time. The service the flight attendants and the seat comfort were fine nothing special. The second leg it was full and it was a hassle before take off with all the carry on bags the crew were asking passengers to collaborate by placing their smaller item under the front seat. This is what it happens when airlines charge for check in bags. You have to purchase the meal on board but the crew with a few smiles serves complimentary non alcoholic drinks. I found it weird when the crew were saying ""We know that you have a choice thank you for choosing us"" during their announcements. I chose American Airlines simply because it offered a lower price despite the long trip I had to do. Overall this airline is not amazing but it's slightly better than some low cost airlines. I would fly with them if they offer a low price."
4667,"Brand new 773 lovely looking aircraft clean interior but inferior product and service compared to alliance partner British Airways. 10 abreast seating is appalling for a long haul flight no comfort no headphones (this caught a lot of passengers out) cabin crew responded with ""the company doesn't give us any!"" - limited interaction with the passengers throughout flight. All in all very disappointing service with the ""new American""."
4668,SFO-MNL return. Flight Attendants were good attentive and responsive. Plane was clean (777) the food was above average. We had a delays from SFO to Narita and Narita back to SFO. Seats were really uncomfortable. A shame as I would definitely recommend them except for the seating comfort. Change your seats ANA.
4669,Flew from St. Pete FL to Tri-Cities TN on Nov. 5. The night before I did get an email that said that the flight had been delayed from 7.45am to 3.05pm. I was thankful for that because their were many people that didn't get the message. So about 2-2.30pm they announce a gate and plane change. They had to get a plane from another airline Suncoast. Since this plane didn't have the same seating they changed to open seating. So they boarded handicapped first then priority people then groups with small children then people with assigned seats and then everyone else (seems like Southwest seating). By the time we did all this it was about 4.15pm. They did give us water and a snack pack on the trip. So we get there late and what do you know there is an Allegiant plane already at the gate. We have to wait another 30-40 minutes until that plane leaves until we can get to the gate. There were no weather problems at either city. I overheard the Suncoast crew saying that Allegiant did have any crew available and that's why they had to change planes.
4670,"After a 6 hour delay originally attributed to a broken air conditioning component estimated to take ""45 minutes"" to fix myself and several other passengers changed our tickets to another later flight to the same destination. After being boarded on that second aircraft we were informed that the ""maintenance log had been removed from the aircraft and not returned as expected"" so we would need to wait until it was located. Initially this appeared to be mere incompetence but swiftly came to seem like subterfuge. Fully an hour later we have just been told there is a panel on our aircraft that has to be replaced. This is supposed to take 1 hour. Meanwhile our original aircraft remains grounded without further explanation. As a passenger I am apprehensive flying on aircraft in such poor repair and moreover feel deceived repeatedly by gate agents and flight crew who are either misinformed themselves or deliberately trying to hide the sorry state of American's fleet. This will be my last flight on American were I not attempting to attend a family wedding I would deplane now."
4671,Flew from DFW to LHR on a 777-200 with my seven year old daughter. This flight was completely full but was acceptable for a long haul flight. The crew were very nice and helpful with my daughter and made her feel at home on her first transatlantic flight. The food and beverage was quite good for economy. Coming back to the USA was an entirely different story. Flew from DUB-Chicago on an old outdated 767-300 that smelt bad and looked very worn. The carpet was dirty and so was the seats. Additionally it was unacceptable to fly transatlantic with community video screens that appear to be running from a DVD setup with poor picture quality and sound. Again the crew was fantastic and treated my daughter extremely well and was very help with making arrangements to catch our next flight to Dallas even though we arrived over an hour late. Completing Customs and Immigration in Dublin saved us from missing out next flight. For the money paid the quality experience was unacceptable.
4672,Flight from London to Miami then Miami to La Paz. By far the most disappointing flight we have had. The cabin crew were unbelievably rude disinterested and unhelpful. We've had much better service with budget airlines. Thought it was ridiculous that people could reserve seats up to one year in advance. Our flights were booked by a tour company so we were unaware of this until a few days before and therefore left with disappointing seats on the way out to our honeymoon destination. Will not fly with American Airlines again.
4673,Flew 777 Los Angeles non-stop to Tokyo. My problem was that I am considerably larger than the average Japanese and the seat although it would go full flat was cramped for me. The cabin was also kept too warm - but most of the Japanese passengers were cold!
4674,I have to say no stars for this airline. So called 'customer service' hung up on me once then when my son called them back they hung up on him too. I signed up for text alerts on my phone but they did not advise me (even after we traveled 3 hours with a rental car for the second leg of our trip to Knoxville airport). After checking in we found out that the flight was cancelled for mechanical reasons for possibly 1-2 days. We ended up renting another car and drove 15 hours reaching home after 4am. What a way to end a vacation! I have to admit they did eventually refund the money because I refused the $100 vouchers they offered. Did not need the vouchers because now I intend to pay full price for a major air carrier. Just so you know because they are not a major carrier they do not make other arrangements for you and if you find a flight you can get on you re paying for it again.
4675,"LHR to Miami return. Where to start. New logo - but old plane old staff old service. 'Turkey slider' in business class? Pre-formed mush. Surly badly dressed cabin crew. One of them was chewing gum and playing Candy Crush when I went to the bathroom! AA lounges in LHR awful - compare that to BA or Virgin! Even worse lounge in Miami - two vouchers for free drinks - for Â£4k? 13 year old 777 noisy  flat bed only goes down part way and worst of all - no laptop power adapters available ""We've stopped providing them""! Well you know what I've stopped using AA."
4676,FCO-ORD. ORD-CMH Flew an ancient plane with no IFE with one shared TV. Seats were uncomfortable. Food was better this time around although the service was bad. The crew missed out serving several rows multiple times on the flight although they kept the drinks coming very frequent. One of the crew members stopped the food service for close to 10 minutes to continue speaking to a passenger about her family.
4677,DFW-ABQ on Aug. 8 and return ABQ-DFW on Aug 15 both legs in First (due to upgrade) on an MD80. Flights nothing special but OK given the limitations on US domestic flights - obviously older planes but comfortable and cabins looked fresher than expected so obviously well maintained/renovated. Catering in First for both 100 minute flights during meal hours was a pack of pretzels and full bar service. White wine on the evening flight to ABQ was warm Chardonnay. FA's were friendly and efficient on the on the flight to ABQ and rather uninterested on the flight back to DFW. Delay of 45 minutes on the flight to ABQ but AA maintained that the flight will be on time until 15 minutes before the designated departure time although a delay was obvious as there was no plane at the gate so slightly irritating bad communication. Return flight eventless and on time. So nothing special but no major problems either. All in all a very average experience.
4678,SIN-Haneda-Chitose then Hakodate-Haneda-SIN. The service was excellent. They did their best to re-arrange the seating so one of us could be with the elderly passengers in our Group. In Hakodate airport we did not ask for priority boarding but staff at the gate noticed and invited us for priority boarding even though we are not seated near the gate. The food is so so but we were on red-eye so it could just be that the breakfast selection is limited. For the inflight entertainment the screen is a bit too bright for red-eye flight even at the lowest brightness settings. The seat is the worst. We have no problem with the short domestic flights but it is just too uncomfortable for international flight over 6 hours. The thin pillow provided does not help to cushion the hardness and it is also not sufficient to fill up the gap in your lower back when you slide the seat forward. The head rest can be adjusted but it is still a bit high for me even at the lowest setting.
4679,Flight from Narita to JFK June 14 2013. Flight attendants were inattentive (and this was business class) spoke little English. The food arrived cold and without apology. In-flight entertainment lacking in variety and limited in choices. All in all an unpleasant experience.
4680,11/27 flight 888 from PIE to ABE. 12/1 flight 803 from Harrisburgh to PIE. They may have low rates but nothing is included and I mean nothing. Carry on check bag water on the plane cookies pretzels peanuts not included. You must pay for everything. There is no inflight entertainment. The seats do not even recline. The planes are old and antiquated the staff are rude. No one is in a hurry for anything. They give you no information no courtesy whatsoever. They change the rules every step of the way. Every person we talked to had a different story and nothing matched. All they did was lie to us. Everything was delayed and there was no compensation to the passangers for the inconvience that was given to them. First our time was changed with no notificAtion then we were told we had to wait 4 hours because the pilot and crew needed time to rest. By the time you pay for baggage a beverage and every other thing you have paid way more than the other airlines.
4681,Recently flew this airline transatlantic route from Dublin to Chicago. The experience was awful! The plane itself was so outdated and old fashioned. It had the screens that dropped down from the ceiling! However on the outward bound flight the crew announced they were not working. So I had a seven hour flight with no film . The crew all wore different uniforms which made them look shabby and unprofessional. I am used to flying European airlines like BA and Aer Lingus whose planes all have the modern personal screens etc and whose cabin crew look smart and professional. My advice is stay well away from AA. I will never again use this airline.
4682,Flight from Chicago to Cleveland cancelled for no reason. Put on standby 4 flights and 10 hours later with no help from gate attendants we fly into Cleveland. Flying out of Cleveland - flight cancelled night before no reason given. Re-booked on earlier flight. Arrive at airport and or course we're not on the manifest. Staff member very rude. Clearly no one who works for American likes it or it's customers either. Since American had cancelled 3 flights the day before they had nothing to do but put us on a United flight where we had to pay an extra $160 for baggage hat we would not have had to pay as our origin tickets were on Alaska Airlines. Never again.
4683,"I have used Allegiant Air during my 4 years while attending school out of state. Yes the cheap flights home when I had breaks were great but I was always delayed. I might have been on one single flight where everything was on time and they didn't push back the time due to ""operational issues"". There were also several times where I had to walk to my car in the airport parking lot in pitch black late at night because my flight was pushed back so much. Me being a young girl this was very unsettling. Allegiant feels that offering free complimentary drinks when the flight is delayed will make everything better well they are wrong. Also when you run into an issue there no settling a canceled flight at the airport you have to sit on the phone for over 30 minutes waiting for the next available travel agent. Honestly I don't think the issues that come along with booking a flight on their airline is worth the cheap flight."
4684,American Airlines cancelled a flight with no warning claimed weather related but on looking at radar for this flight path that was fabricated. They made no effort to notify by email or cell phone (had both). I found out about the canceled flight when I arrived at the gate with my boarding pass. This resulted in a 15 hour drive. My advice - find a different airline.
4685,Flew out to Dallas from Heathrow in the new Boeing 777 which as a plane was okay and had good entertainment. They have a 343 layout which makes it cramped compared to a lot of other airlines I have flown with which have a 333 layout which feels more spacious. Some of the flight crew were quite unprofessional. One of them walking around with earphones in holding his iPod in his hand. Food was close to terrible. Returned on a Boeing 767 which had been painted on the outside to make it look modern but was like a museum on the inside. Old TV monitors hanging from the ceiling which showed one film on a nine hour flight which I couldn't watch as somebody had snapped off their headphone jack in my socket. Checked in really early but still sat apart. Food terrible again but flight crew a bit more professional this time. Have flown over 30 different airlines and I would say this airline is in the bottom 3.
4686,SIN-NRT-SFO and LAX-NRT-SIN. 767 Cradle Chair on the SIN-NRT-SIN legs in a 2x1x2 layout. Flight attendants were great and the chair comfortable for a day light flight. NRT-SFO and LAX-NRT was in the new 777 with staggered lay flat seats. Flight attendants on these legs didn't seem as engaging or interested as the flights from Singapore. Also pyjamas are available on these long haul flights but are not offered you have to ask for them. Also no amenity kit is offered. Food on board is fine as long as you love fish otherwise you will go hungry. There was one Non-Fish main meal available on each flight so really no choice at all. I would expect more from a business class meal service.
4687,Took a non-stop from Fort Lauderdale to Lexington hoping to avoid the mad scramble in Atlanta. Big mistake. This airline left late due to engine issues (had to get a replacement aircraft) then when we arrived the ramp wouldn't work. It took 45 minutes for them to figure out they needed to open the rear stairs and allow us off. No discussion of perhaps just taxiing to a different gate. After replacing another hour yes hour awaiting bags. My advice skip the non-stop and stick with Delta.
4688,Was in Vegas headed to Dallas. The weather had been bad that morning in Dallas. Contacted my husband about the weather when it came to my flight home and the weather was clear. They had delayed our trip for 9 hours for no apparent reason and had failed to inform us of this. They had delays due to weather early that morning the flight coming from Dallas to Vegas was sitting at the airport and wouldn't load their passengers. Waited around for 9 hours only to find out by 10 pm that night that the flight was cancelled and it was too late to get a hotel. The staff in Vegas were very rude and pretentious. They didn't care about any of the passengers and were snappy when asked questions. I do not recommend this airline at all!
4689,I am not picky about the airlines and used to travel by the cheapest deals available. This time I took AA. Flying American Airlines was the worst experience for me. The planes were mostly old and run down. They took 2 hrs to fix the bolt and screws while flying to San Diego on flight AA 49. The staff especially at Dallas boarding desk was rude and changed my seat without an apology. Not only that see was upfront rude. Each flight were at least an hour or 2 late. There are definitely better options and I would not fly this airline again.
4690,"I was flying from Dublin to JFK NY on July 30 flight 291. I got the impression that serving the needs of the passengers was not a priority. I had reported to a flight attendant about some good amount of water sloshing around in the lavatory. It was slippery and the dirty liquid had got on my shoes and clothing. The flight attendant replied that she did not think the liquid was water and was not going to touch it. I do not understand why it could not have been mopped up. I think is was very inappropriate of the Airline to not train their flight attendants in mopping up unpleasant ""spills"" in the lavatories and providing them the sanitary means of doing so. This was upsetting to me to have to use lavatories with unsanitary conditions on an airline! The American Airline website makes it very difficult to send a complaint to. I think this is very important for them to see this and to correct it. I gave the airline poor ratings and do not plan to fly it again."
4691,"Flew London Heathrow to JFK. Had transferred from Qatar from JNB-DOH-LHR. This was a bit like going from a fine Hotel (Qatar) to a cheap roadside motel (American). The American Business Class lounge/Admirals Club lounge at LHR beyond the new entrance is simply a dump. Old tired furniture no charm or ambience and an almost complete lack of any kind of decent food or snacks. I saw one tureen of dried up pasta and some pretzels and 2-3 halves of white bread sandwiches. Self serve beverages were somewhat limited with cheap brands of alcohol and ""spouts"" on the wine bottles-a really low class touch. Although the roughly half full business does have a state of the art flat bed seat with decent storage the cabin service was dismal. Pre departure beverages were served in flimsy plastic glasses. Cabin staff attitude throughout the flight was casual and usually indifferent. I slept until approx. 1.5 hours before landing missing the snack service. No a single member of the cabin crew offered to serve it to me later. The rear lavatories were devoid of any cosmetics the forward lavatories were stocked. Of course there were no flowers in the lavatories. Catering was adequate the menu was a tiny card like affair nothing like the elegant and extensive menu presented in a folder on Qatar. I am thoroughly convinced that flying on American or any US Airline on long distance flights is wasting money and accepting poor treatment and it makes more sense to choose non US airlines which offer their premium customers a much higher standard of service."
4692,NRT to BKK. 05/20. Flight was really old the screen was not clean and seat too small. Food was ok but not many movies to choose from compared to other airlines. Ticket price much more expensive than other airlines but not at the same quality level.
4693,I was extremely dissatisfied with the fact that I had to pay for a seat. I chose a seat that I liked and preferred to sit in paid the fee and expected a good flight with a window seat close to the front of the aircraft. When I arrived to board I was told that we were to board a different plane and that the seat that I had paid for no longer mattered and I had to sit wherever I could. Granted I will be reimbursed the money for the seat but I paid for something I did not get and was not forewarned until boarding. I got stuck in a middle seat and was uncomfortable the entire flight. This is not good business. If a customer pays for something they expect it.
4694,JFK-MXP-JFK. Both flights departed a few minutes early and arrived on time. Aircraft was an 'updated' 767-300ER with the new Biz Class and Main Cabin Extra where we were seated. Had the bulkhead seat both ways in this mini MCE cabin of 2 rows which made a difference. Service was ok food below average from JFK but much better from Milan. The only real downer is the lack of personal IFE or streaming IFE on this plane only main screen entertainment was available. Were lucky though to have a professional friendly and warm flight attendant from Milan.
4695,ORD-MIA-GRU in Economy on July 28. Daylight flight from Miami to Sao Paulo - delayed 4 hours and that is where American failed its passengers. They boarded us and at the departure time they asked us to de-board as the plane has mechanical issues. Ok - fine. They say there is a plane at a gate that will take us to SP and they just need to service the plane. That was a lie - all the passengers got to the gate (and we had been told to take our pillows and blankets as the new plane wouldn't have them) and there was no plane. We sat around for 3 hours before a plane showed up from the hanger where 4 AA 777s sat the whole time. Finally board and take off - 8 hour flight and flight attendants were friendly. Seat comfort is awful - no leg room due to entertainment box at the window. Seat cushion is non-existent so luckly the extra pillow helped (we got on the plane and blankets and pillows were already there). Upon landing in Sao Paulo at 12:10am (4 hours late) we finally got an apology from the flight deck - until then they didn't say a thing about the delay. Come on American - have some respect for the people who pay your bills. I did get an email when I landed with an apology and 5000 AA miles - ok - that's nice. But I felt sorry for the many passengers who missed connecting flights at 12.10am there are no more flights until morning. I had a 2.5 hour drive to Santos and didn't get to my hotel until 3am. When AA does it well - its great. When they fail - its really bad.
4696,Flight 950 from MNL-NRT. Delayed 2 hours. Not one apology heard from any crew member or customer service. Service was so so. Nothing spectacular. older style 767. Audio Visual didn't work and when I told a crew member she said she would look into it. Never came back. Pretty bad service especially when other airlines are priced cheaper.
4697,Bellingham to Vegas got to airport on time but found out our plane was delayed cause of a flat tire. 6.5 hours later we left as they had to fly a tire from Las Vegas on the next flight. They gave us water pop and a $8 voucher for food. They said they would give us a $100 voucher for our next trip on our account. I phoned them and no 800 number so you have to pay for the call. They go threw a 5 minutes of jargon and then they tell you you will be another 20 minutes. Did not wait. I flew with them when they first started great airline they and now sad to see they have gone the other way.
4698,I had a voucher from Allegiant that I had from January 2013 and had to use by Jan 2015 which I did the end of October 2013. They had already charged me $80.00 for voucher issue which they deducted. Very hard to use website in booking a flight. I chose my seats which I paid for did not get the ones I signed up for on my departure flight. Then I made a typo scheduling my return on 12/22(was supposed to come back on 11/3. Not their fault on that. When I had to change it they charged me for seats again adding $342.00 in fees for my wife and myself. The seats don't recline nor or they comfortable. Very cheap. Will hitch hike before ever using them.
4699,JFK to LHR. AA's problems are no longer the fleet its old tired flight attendants that should be in bed rather than serving passengers paying up to $6000 for a business class seat with an attitude and a lack of respect that is simply unacceptable. Other passengers complained as well. Just impersonal and rude service on AA104. American needs to ground those FA's that are older and with attitude. Hire younger FA's that want to do their job rather than complaining to passengers about how the airlines have changed and how what we pay for the seats isn't worth it. After 33 years I'm not flying AA anymore. Ill go BA or anything other than an American carrier. They just honestly are awful now and I see no change due to them being union. Fly a foreign carrier. You'll see the difference.
4700,We flew from Shreveport LA to DFW. We then flew from Dallas to London. Neither plane left on time or got us there on time. We had people waiting in London. Same happened on the way back. On the way back we were shuttled to British Airways. Got to Dallas had a six hour layover. Because British Airways was late getting us to Dallas the layover was five hours. We sat in the airport in Dallas for 4.5 hours at the gate we were supposed to leave from. Twenty minutes before the plane was to leave from Dallas the gate was changed and we had to run to get to the new gate. I have come to the conclusion that American Airlines doesn't care at all about their customers. For the prices people are charged for tickets and fees you would think service would be better. Won't fly American again.
4701,3 hour delay to destination and 4 hour delay coming back. Both flights were nonstop but could not get out of the airport and this was not weather related. Thought we would give Allegiant a try due to convenience. Going back to the big guys.
4702,When flying Allegiant Air - check your VISA statements. Our family booked for an upcoming trip to Vegas and should have been charged $3021 however we just received our statement and we were charged 4 x for same trip. Then the whole frustrating deal trying to talk to a human - first you have to email them then they will give you a phone number then you have to phone and wait time is between 30 - 90 minutes (in our case 90 minutes of Long Distance from Canada) only to be told they don't see the error on their end so send them the visa statement as proof. Which I did and asked for confirmation that they received fax as well as confirmation when it is corrected. No customer service No apologies.
4703,On my MIA-LHR leg I flew the 777-200 which is an awful configuration 2-3-2. What a lovely surprise on the way back to fly a 777-300 with a great configuration of 1-2-1. I was by the window great. Upgraded seat and a great crew to complement it. Wish AA would get rid of the 2-3-2 configuration in business - pathetic.
4704,July 31 we were on flight 3143 NAS to MIA. Flight was scheduled to take off at 605. We were on the runway on time when a passenger became ill. We returned to the terminal. They left her on board until a paramedic arrived to check her out. At this point she felt better and wanted to continue but had to wait until someone from headquarters arrived to determine if it was safe for her to stay on the flight. They took her off the plane then allowed her to return then took her off again. Every person on that plane had a connecting flight to catch. They then had to refuel the plane. We then got back on the runway then had to go back to check out a maintenance issue. We sat there another 30 minutes. Then we had to get off the plane while they worked on it. At 9.30 we boarded again then had to wait for a passenger who couldn't decide whether or not to continue. We finally left NAS at 10 pm. When we landed in MIA we had to go back through customs find our luggage then try to find someone from AA to help us all reschedule flights. No one from AA was available to help us until after 11 pm. They put us up overnight at a local hotel and rescheduled all our flights for the next day but it was a very poorly handled situation. I do not plan to use AA in the future. We have used other airlines many times and have had issues but never anything handled this poorly.
4705,I have been an airline passenger for the past 60 years. All types of planes to all types of destinations with all types of carriers. The golden years you might say when the flights were not only comfortable but fun and even riotous at times! The service food and drinks (especially the drinks) were an integral and indispensable part of the experience. It is sad to see what was once a wonderful and exciting experience reduced to the level of a bus ride and a damn uncomfortable bus ride at that! Flight AA121 Paris (CDG) to New York (JFK) July 2nd 2014 gave a glimmer of hope. The cabin crew were experienced co-ordinated pleasant and most helpful.
4706,"Haneda to LAX on 777-200 in economy class. These seats were the most uncomfortable I have even had the displeasure to be in. They are very narrow seats and the leg room was tight. If you are 5'2"" and weigh 100 lbs. I guess they would be ok. It was not possible to recline the seat very much because the bottom of the back part of the seat cut into your back it was miserable. The seat cushion was shallow and gave very little support to your bottom. The food started off with a sandwich which seemed about the same you would receive from a vending machine. The meal service two hours from landing in LAX was mediocre at best. I will never fly ANA. My comparison is seven other airlines I have used over the years trans-pacific. ANA is the worst for comfort and food."
4707,"We paid for 6 business class tickets from Zurich via London to Dallas. Then 4 business class tickets from Los Angeles to London to Zurich. I've never seen a more consistent disgruntled group of employees in all of the years I've flown overseas. Where to begin? We chose American because of the ""New"" business class. We were given an old plane. My family is very low maintenance. We only ask for simple respect. We are mid flight and AA cancels our connection from Dallas to Grand Junction. 10 hours before we are to board. We don't get the notification until we reach our gate to fly to Grand Junction. No effort on AA part at all to help us. No hotel no car service. We make our own arrangements. This may seem small but by this point we are exhausted. Any help at all by AA would have been appreciated. Our return trip. I went for more water I was told they only had the large bottles. If I wanted more water I could bring my small empty water bottle up and refill it. Not how can I help you? Not can I bring the water to you? They stand there chatting while I try to refill my bottle."
4708,I recently flew with AA and US Airways from New York Boston and Washington DC. I cannot believe that American Airlines is part of the One World Alliance. When you look at the level of service you get from world class airlines like Qantas Cathay Pacific and LAN and then see the pathetic offering you get from AA I am dumbstruck. As a frequent Australian traveller I absolutely hate having to use AA anytime. Their Admirals Club lounges are truly pathetic - paying for food and pseudo-snacks like pretzels and plastic wrapped muffins. AA passengers who fly Qantas and use the Qantas Club lounges must be amazed. The service on AA is uniformly awful and rude. How can Americans put up with such an array of shocking airline companies. Now that AA have bought US Airways it will be doubly bad.
4709,LAX-HND-ITM round trip. Staff at check in unfriendly and confused. Requested special meals not onboard. LAX-HND and HND-LAX the first meal was a sandwich delivered by hand (without a tray). Selection of beverages was poor seat uncomfortable. The staff friendly but not helpful.
4710,This is the most disorganized and unprofessional airline I've travelled with. My husband and I flew from Bellingham to Las Vegas. I spoke to a woman on the phone to find out how the seat selection works. She was very short with me I called a second time spoke to a different person who told me I'd be better off checking in at the airport as opposed to online if I don't want to pay and want to select 2 seats together because online it's computer generated but at the airport a real person will select seats for you. Upon arrival at the airport I was told that wasn't true regardless how you do it it's all computer generated. Our flight ended up getting cancelled due to fog and the plane landed at a different airport. It took them hours to give us this information even though they knew the flight had landed elsewhere. Finally we were told the flight would be the next day. No assistance was offered to help us with the cost of an overnight in a hotel. When a mob formed to complain they reluctantly offered names of several hotels that would provide a distress rate. On the flight the seats are pretty cramped and do not recline at all. Absolutely nothing was offered in the way of food beverages or reading material not even water. Initially you would think Allegiant is a much cheaper alternative but they charge you for everything. If you bring a carry on it's $13 in advance or $50 at the airport each way. For a checked bag it's $20 in advance or $50 at the airport each way.
4711,My flight out of Chicago was delayed for hours and then cancelled at 1am. Understandable taking into consideration Chicago weather. However it was the customer service received during and after this that convinced me to end my days as an American Airlines flyer. I spent the next few hours on hold with customer service trying to get my flight rebooked. After 3.5 hours on hold I booked a flight for the following morning through the AA website to ensure that I would return home on time. The next morning unable once again to contact customer service I boarded the flight and made it home in time to return to work. Only after I finally contacted customer service did I learn that I had in fact been booked on a rescheduled flight. I searched my inbox spam and trash but had received no sort of email or notification of the rescheduling. If I had been informed of this flight or been able to contact customer service I could have foregone the cost of a second flight and avoided all of the frustrating cold emails that have taken place since.
4712,DFW to PDX - the service was terrible. First the price: it was $360 round-trip non-stop. While this may sound like a good deal it was not too long ago that American wanted $500 for the same trip. I could go to Europe one- way for that! The price drop is the only reason why I give them 2 out of 5 stars for value. If it weren't for that I would give them one-star without a second thought. Second the lines for baggage check were long. Apparently this airline does not realize that it's 2014: I was completely unable to pay my baggage fee online and there was no fast check-in option either. So I had to wait in line to do something I could have done online with other air carriers and only takes five minutes at most with other ones. Third the seats. They were harder than rocks with virtually no leg room with my messenger bag below the seat in front of me. It was virtually impossible to sleep or rest in my seat. When I got off the plane I was very sore. The flight attendants did not care about my experience and the check-in agents flat out ignored me at PDX. Lastly when I emailed American with a complaint about these issues I got the most sarcastic response I have ever got from a customer service representative. In conclusion I never plan on flying American again. I'd rather have a stop (or two!) than fly them.
4713,Narita to Los Angeles. This Flight was booked on Orbitz with United but codeshared with ANA from Tokyo to LA. Ended up with bad seats as our confirmed seat were not honored by ANA. B777-300s shell seats in the economy section the worst I have experienced. The food served on the flight was excellent and the staff very helpful and friendly.
4714,JFK-Tokyo staggered seating - excellent. Staff friendly but did not make any extra effort. I went to galley 3 times for a wine fill-up during dinner because of non existent service. Spoke with purser about this after meal and for rest of flight had an FA on me every minute which was also quite awkward. They really had no idea of proper service. Tokyo-Manila - ridiculous old plane inedible food but lovely if not apologetic service. Very disappointed.
4715,I travel from the Huntington and Charleston WV area to Orlando or St Petersburg Florida at least once a month and have done so for 5 years now. Allegiant has charged a one way price as cheap as $19.99 each way and as high as $249.99 each way. Prices are very weird. I understand their schedules and schedule problems. I don't understand their prices. Allegiant is convenient for my travel plans but in 5 years they have made so many changes with booking baggage and especially seating. They never offer any kind of relief for any of their mistakes. Today I received an e-mail advertising a one way special to St Petersburg for $44.00 for dates 12-9 through 12-23. I immediately opened the website and tried to book at this price only to find out after a 45 minute wait on the customer complaint phone line that those prices sold out completely but there were plenty of seats available for $92. Gate personnel in Huntington have been very rude and even yell at passengers. Customer complaints and assistance by phone are put on hold up to an hour. Gate rules and booking rules are not enforced once on the plane. Such as overhead usage and seating. I will continue to use Allegiant but only if I can catch a good price. It is much more convenient consistent and comfortable to drive an extra 45 minutes to Columbus and book with Airtran.
4716,I will never fly AA again. The Miami staff were very rude and not accommodating at all. Flight was late leaving from Turks and Caicos and staff failed to announce the delay by half an hour. Therefore I missed my connecting flight in Miami to LGA. Miami Staff were not accommodating. I had an older aunt with me and I asked for a wheelchair twice it never came. AA staff had no sense of direction or didn't speak enough English - it was terrible! Never again.
4717,Two hour delay to ride on a plane with mechanical problems treated rudely not offered even a bottle of water for being delayed. Other airlines we have flown on have given us vouchers for food when we were inconvenienced. I witnessed an Allegiant employee laugh at a customer that had waited over an hour for her luggage. We stood in line with the other passengers on our flight for 15 minutes while three agents leaned on the counter and did nothing only to find out we were standing in a line that was for re-ticketing for a cancelled flight. The re-ticketing agent was telling passengers that they were in the wrong line one at a time as they requested their boarding passes. Our agent was very gruff and acted as though he was conducting some kind of military exercise.
4718,We were booked on Flight 541 from Monterey to Las Vegas on Sunday 10/6. After the plane was loaded a passenger had to be removed by security and the flight was then cancelled. This cancellation was not the airline's fault. But the flight the next day was scheduled for 5.35 pm and it was delayed until 7.30 pm. Then once we were all on the plane ready to go the auxiliary power unit would not turn on and there was another delay until they could get the engines started. We finally arrived in Las Vegas at 9 pm. Monday night. There were no problems with our return flight but after this experience and reading the other reviews I don't think we will take Allegiant again.
4719,"Let me start by saying I am a regular business flier and travel frequently although because of issues like the following complaint usually only fly AA as a last resort. On a recent trip from LGA to DFW AA forced me to gate- check my same standard 22in. carry-on bag which I take on every flight on every other airline. The bag clearly fit within the test box when I had to test it the first time going through the security checkpoint and similarly fit again when forced to test it at the gate but because the agent said I had to ""push"" it down to fit within the box it was too big and had to be checked. When I boarded the plane I was frustrated to see that the bag would have easily fit within the overhead compartment. Maybe AA has smaller jets with smaller overhear storage capacity than every other major airline. This was a big inconvenience and was easily avoidable and I will continue to avoid flying on AA whenever possible."
4720,Took NH 1063 from HND to HNL earlier this month. The check in process was horrible. The Agent failed to let me know where the lounge was and didn't let me know that I was able to access the lounge since I was on an international business class ticket. I found the lounge and nothing fancy. Children were running around the food and drink selection was ok. Flight was uneventful. Seats on 767 product are clearly old. The comparable product on both JAL and UAL are much better at a better price. The food was horrible the entertainment system was old and the inflight service didn't tell me about snacks that I could have ordered at anytime. Would I fly them again? Probably not. They have good staff they just need to know how to respect the customers and staff.
4721,Took ANA from SEA-NRT-MNL and back. Flight from SEA to NRT and NRT to SEA were both 3 hours delayed. B787 was very nice comfy and lots of leg room. Cabin lights switched automatically and helped in resting. B777 interior is not good. Seats are too tight and not enough leg room. Food and drinks are the best though. B767 is much better than their B777. Poor inflight entertainment very few selections. Will I fly with ANA again? No not until they get better with their schedules and fix their B777 interiors. If they will use their 787s completely I might consider flying with them again. ANA's best asset - their flight crew very hardworking and the best customer service I've had in a flight.
4722,Just flew from St Pete to South Bend and back over the past weekend. We purchased and checked in online with no problems. They're a nice airline with friendly staff and clean fairly roomy planes. Our only issue was the punctuality problem they seem to have with everyone. Our flights were delayed both times by 20-25 minutes. Not deal killers but still annoying. Seems like they would be more concerned about maintaining their schedule but they don't apologize and everyone acts as if that's standard procedure. Feel free to leave the A/C on while we're waiting to depart or deplane. It gets stifling real quick.
4723,The boarding passes we printed out at DFW Airport showed that the flight from DFW to TYR originally scheduled at 6pm was delayed to 8pm. We still went to the gate to see if the delay was changed. The monitor showed that the flight was delayed to 8pm. After we returned to the gate at 7pm we were told the flight left at 6.30. There was no more flights from DFW to TYR afterwards. The assistant checked us in for the 9.00 flight the next day. When we requested whether there was a voucher for a hotel we were told no. We called the customer service and were blamed for not listening to the announcements. We had to rent a car to return home and drove back to DFW next day to return the rental car. Each person was trying to shift the responsibility away to somebody else. If they made profits by charging passengers more and providing less service whats to celebrate?
4724,Flight AA1018 DUS-LHR on 5/6/2014 onboard N936NN (B738). Flight was on time and smooth. Food and drinks to buy. Crew were typically American and not that friendly. Legroom was adequate but no more.
4725,From LA to Chicago on 22nd June on American Airlines. Perfect service from staff at the airport to FA's on the plane. I have read a lot of bad reviews on this website but can only say my husband and I found our flight more than we expected. Our luggage was delayed for about an hour but this was I believe only due to two planes arriving at the same time.
4726,Flight from Germany to Charlotte NC to Huntsville AL in 05/2014 was the worst flight experience. TV screen did not work staff was not concerned after numerous requests. The aircraft had a malfunction before takeoff in NC delaying us 3 hours on the taxiway. This caused a missed flight at the connection stop. American did not care whatsoever and we had to ask to get a meal voucher but that was all that was given. They would only put us on another American flight that left hours later putting us home in the middle of the night and needed to be at work the next morning. Worst airline ever. This review only covers about 65% of the issues experienced.
4727,Flight between LHR and NRT (B777-300ER). First time to experience the fixed back seat. The seat itself was too hard not comfortable enough for a 12 hour flight. Also when you are in the position to sleep by sliding your seat you will have no space for your knees. The meals were just OK but entertainment was excellent. Each seat in Economy has got a power socket so you do not need to worry about battery on your mobile/laptop.
4728,LHR-MIA-LHR. It is some time since I have flown AA transatlantic after many years of having previously done so when both the hard and soft products were truly appalling. This choice came about as a result of the fare being two-thirds of the next best so difficult to ignore. Both sectors were by B77W equipment with the new Business Class configuration. This is a vast improvement. The cabin crew actually seemed to enjoy being there (almost) although the sole male cabin crew member in Business on the return flight was extremely obnoxious. Food was ok- ish and whilst I had chosen my entrees on-line for both sectors there was no record on board of any of my selections. The cabin crew told me that this on-line facility was a complete waste of time as it never worked. Overall AA was better than my recollection of many years before but hard product apart it continues to be still a long way behind the alternatives.
4729,Booked flights for the husband and I from BOS to MIA in October. Received an email changing our flight times and seats after we had purchased and selected. Threw us off the original time and put another flight number in its place. Had no reasonable explanation other than they are re-figuring their planes! Really messed up our departure for sure. The planes are so old and dirty. Couldn't even use the bathroom as it was filthy on our last flight. The attendants were miserable! TV monitors were from the dark ages not to mention the inside condition of the plane. It was falling apart from the inside. Could see the outer shell from my seat! Charge megabucks for low class experience.
4730,MIA-BOG-MIA. Both sectors were flown by very tired B752s with equally tired cabin crews. I have been flying these sectors along with other Latin routes with (Latin) American Airlines which bears little resemblance to AA mainline for some 25 years on the same aircraft type with the same take-it or leave-it cabin crew attitudes. Wifi and in-flight power is heavily advertised on these aircraft but were not available on either sector. Both aircraft and cabin crew are in need of a substantial refresh.
4731,HND-HNL and sad to say the service has dropped off. Told the seat I had confirmed was no longer available at check in was told to ask at the gate. At the gate they gave me a sigh and said to ask the Attendants onboard. Once onboard the Chief Purser was polite but too busy telling her staff what to do and I eventually went to my middle seat. After the plane took off I asked again and another attendant told me it was not possible even though there was an open aisle seat a few rows in front of mines. Its unfortunate but I don't think I will fly ANA for a while.
4732,"When Allegiant Air began flying from Allentown PA to destinations in Florida they were wonderful to fly with. Their staff was courteous and their flights were very reasonably priced. I told everyone I knew how wonderful my experiences were with them. How things have changed! They are now one of the rudest group of people I've ever encountered in a service based industry. During my past few trips from Allentown to Clearwater I've had one bad experience after another. Instead of trying to help they've continually stated ""We are now an a la carte airline"". I'm sure that they don't care but they have lost another customer."
4733,Will never fly AA again. The experience at Dallas was terrible. Flight was late therefore missed flight. Boarded another flight but told to get off due to mechanical problem. Very little information on what to do next. Sent to four different gates. Treated like cattle. Never made it out that day and no guarantee to fly next day. Forced to go to a different airport and buy another ticket on Southwest. No apologies by AA personnel. Customer service was the worst I've experienced in over 50 years of traveling.
4734,I travelled American Airlines on Flight AA55 from Manchester UK to Chicago. This was an awful flight. The aircraft had no in seat entertainment the seats were old and uncomfortable the headrests hardly lifted above the seat so for a taller person the backrest sticks in your back. In addition the staff were at best terse at worst indifferent. I can only believe they are as fed up as I was being stuck on that aircraft. On the bright side it arrived on time overall however it was a prime example of a truly budget flight the only thing is I paid a lot of money for the flight. I only went this route because I needed to go to Chicago never again.
4735,I purchased a flight with American Airline to fly from Miami to New Orleans on July 3-7. They changed my flight to US Air but didn't inform me until one week before flight. I paid for upgrade seats but it was not transferred over. Now what really bother me was my return trip home from New Orleans well I didn't get back until a day later. Both airlines seemed to simply want to place blame on each other when they should be working together on rescheduling flights when they cancel them. American whom I booked with originally were of absolutely no use to me once they changed me to a US Air flight. Though it took many back and forth trips between the two companies finally a supervisor with US Air provided me with some assistance in getting me booked on another flight to fly out a day later. It's ridiculous that it would take me 4 hours in the airport to get rescheduled when I checked in well in advance (4hours) after my flight was canceled. I should not have needed a supervisor to get my flight rescheduled all agents should be able to do it. I went through 5 agents between AA and US Air and none were helpful. When airlines join forces to become one company they should be operating as one not passing the buck and blame between each other.
4736,JFK to Narita (B777-300). Excited to try the fixed back shell seats went in with an open mind but unfortunately I cant give it a good review. The food and service is unbeatable but in terms of seat comfort I still prefer the traditional seats that recline. The bottom of the seat slides forward and the back slides down at an angle within the shell seat but the head rest remains straight up. When the seat is reclined you lose substantial amount of leg room. My knees were touching the back of the seat in front when in full recline. The foot rest/massager is good but the novelty wears off quickly. I was able to fall asleep but woke up on a number of occasions due to not having enough cushion. ANA should follow Cathay Pacific and eliminate the shell seating on their 777s.
4737,Took AA on a trip to Spain. En route two of my three flights were delayed almost causing me to miss a connection and my baggage was lost - not sure if by American or one of the affiliated carriers. The worst was yet to come however. My flight from Madrid to NYC was delayed by a couple hours and so I was rebooked for my connecting flight. I wish I'd insisted on catching it since it was delayed anyway because what transpired after was unbelievable. The rebooked flight to DC was eventually canceled. We sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours as maintenance repaired a broken chair then a door and then we lost our slot in the queue and had to wait awhile and then my home airport suspended flights coming and going due to weather. Finally the pilot took us back to the gate and told us our flight was canceled. 4 hours on the tarmac that day. Service to rebook flights was slow and some agents were a bit snippy. Slept at the gate overnight for my early flight the next morning. Had a bad feeling when I saw people arriving through the same gate 15 minutes prior to our scheduled boarding time. Sure enough we sat there for well over an hour as the tyre on the plane was being changed and then the flight was canceled. Exasperated I asked for a flight out of LaGuardia instead and although it was delayed on the runway I eventually got home after four bookings from NYC to DC. Very tight seat arrangement on the planes flying back (because they were older). Food wasn't bad and service on all the planes was overall pretty good. Service at the gate ranged from very solicitous to brusque. The airline seems to schedule flights too close together. On top of that the planes on my return trip were all old and shoddy hence the delays. So I ended up being booked for eight flights round trip when I was originally scheduled for just five. Seven of eight were delayed and two of those led to cancellations. American didn't do much to compensate me for the inconvenience either. I will never fly AA again.
4738,Just returned from Okinawa on ANA connecting through Narita. Domestic flight was okay. International flight to LAX a newly configured 777-300 was tough. The fixed back seat is the most uncomfortable seat - could not get comfortable for 10 hours. The food ranged from odd to not right. A word of advice when picking a western menu go with choices that capture a wider spectrum of the western palette. The service was okay however it took almost three hours for main cabin lights to be dimmed on an overnight flight. The inflight entertainment screens were nice. Best interactive flight tracker I have seen. Movie selection was lacking for the caliber of AVOD system ANA invested in.
4739,ORD-SEA first class. Standard first class seats. Nothing special but comfortable. Lunch was surprisingly good. Glad we pre-selected the beef dish. Decent selection of beer and wine. Still don't like the fact that buying a domestic first class ticket doesn't get us into the airline's airline's club but this is standard at least among U.S. airlines.
4740,HKG-DFW. Check-in: no online check-in for some reason had to do it at the airport. Good no problem. Boarding: for all US-bound flights they had to search all our hand-carry bags for water/liquids and they do it in the middle of the bridge where the air isn't moving very well and warm. I don't understand why can't they do it right before scanning the boarding pass. The bridge area is small not a smart idea at all. I feel bad for those in a long line for the economy class. In-flight: Food/meals are very good no complaints there. The seat is excellent with lie-flat bed and big screen monitor. One problem there were several movies/TV shows that are shown available but couldn't get to it. Other than that slept well and services were fine.
4741,I recently flew on ANA Business Class from Narita to Chicago and was served my beef fillet uncooked (not even rare) and had to ask that it be cooked further. When we were served breakfast it wasn't even heated up cold omelette. Again we had to ask them to take it back and at least warm it. They warmed it to the minimum. Staff turns up the heat during flight (I assume to put everyone to sleep) as service is hard to come by in between meal service. Overall service and food needs to be improved to ensure quality service in all cabins. Service needs to be checked or aisles at least walked between meal services. Air temp. needs to be cooler. We were seated in business class. The seats are ok but still not comfortable when in flat bed mode. I would only take ANA again if I got a free ticket using miles.
4742,NRT-CDG. I have been a regular customer of ANA over the last 10 years (meaning bronze member most years). In recent years the overall quality is going down terribly. The worst is probably the new economy class seats used now on virtually all long haul flights that do not recline. Seats on long haul flights that do not recline. Try getting some rest in those seats if you're more than 175 cm tall. Second worst is mileage awards/accrual policy which terribly lags behind the competition in star alliance and elsewhere. Most tickets bought with ANA now only provide you with 50% actual miles accrual. Third is small size of portions (though nice food I must say). All in all ANA has gone down and I now prefer flying United to the US or Lufthansa to Europe. This is a shame because this used to be a really great company.
4743,Had a 6 part trip this month on AA. Every leg had issues. Mechanical problems abound due to the age of the fleet. Arrived at JFK for the vacation portion of this trip and was told at the first class check in that our aircraft was removed from service and we would be 6 hours delayed departing. We missed our first day of vacation and a party because of this. Bottom line you can't rely on this company to get you where you are going in any reliable way. Also have issues with their website frequently down lack of communication with flight delays also.
4744,Just flew 4 domestic sectors LAX-DFW-OMA and DSM-DFW-LAX. Ex LAX boarded on time but then due to weather in DFW were delayed for roughly 2 hours. Informed of delay by Captain and given updates. Once underway beverage service given inflight video shown. Overnight in DFW then to OMA next day. Flight delayed due to mechanical issues. Passengers allowed off plane after first hour cabin crew offered juice and water then granola bars. Flight cancelled after 4 hours. $12 refreshment vouchers given. Replacement aircraft and eventually got away about 5.5 hours late. Whilst this was an inconvenience I believe the staff acted properly keeping passengers informed and making alternate arrangements. Return flight I requested baggage to be checked through to SYD which took some time to organise due to booking problems caused by the earlier delay when I had been taken off the delayed flights but then reinstated. Only complaint was during this time our pre-assigned seats were given away and we were given seats at the back of the aircraft without the additional leg room. All things considered I was happier to have bags checked through and less legroom. I have been critical of AA in the past but thus trip they receive full marks.
4745,I had not flown AA for a few years and now I know why. AA employees sat in first class on a very early flight from TPA-MIA and spoke loudly to one another while the other first class passengers tried to sleep. Had a 7.40pm flight from MIA-TPA but paid a $75 plane change fee to take the 5.50pm flight. No problem there except for the fact that the plane flight 986 from STT-MIA had an alarm mishap and they had to call a maintenance personnel from off-site. He was very late so therefore missed the earlier connection at 5.50pm from MIA-TPA and took my original flight at 7.40pm-no compensation returned for their error. Other members in my party had first class on the 5.50pm flight and did not receive it when we were all booked on the 7.40pm flight. They did attempt to put us all together but placed us in the exit row with two children traveling under the age of 15. Therefore the kids had to sit in other areas in the plane and were scared to sit alone. Upon a later arrival to TPA at 8.40pm AA/US AIR misplaced our luggage and was it was all still sitting in Miami with Priority tags on them. So much for priority as they turned up a day and a half later.
4746,Flew ANA return from Singapore to Tokyo in July 2012. Seats do not recline in economy however the bottom cushion shifts forward. For someone of average height this is probably fine however being over 6ft this just crushes my leg room so had to spend the entire midnight flight trying to sleep in a completely upright position. Secondly the meals were awful. I had the choice of a local meal and a 'western meal' of a hamburger covered in cheese with one small baby carrot. Finally the entertainment system was really not first class and offered little variety. Either way I will be paying a premium next time to fly with a better carrier.
4747,"You get what you pay for! We have flown with them 6 times and noticed that there is a 50-50 chance that you might make your destination on time (or on the same day). Do not depend on them to get you anyplace on a tight schedule. We always allow 1 day between connections. Departure passengers often sit on the plane for hour(s) - sweating/freezing - while the status of the flight will be reported as ""in route"". Very often the Flight Staff are a blessing and they have a lot of humor about how bad the service is (In Flight Entertainment!). If Allegiant promises you a refund/voucher don't hold your breath. SWA will be about the same price once you factor in the extra $$ on bags seat assignments old Coke and bagged peanuts."
4748,Providenciales - Miami: AA300. Miami - Paris: AA62. Both flights on old aircraft in particular the flight from Miami to Paris was dreadful on an old 767. No AVOD or individual screen. The seats were the most uncomfortable I have experienced. Food was tasteless and bland with portions quite small. Drinks service was decent but really that was all with the flight that was a positive. Staff seemed disinterested and tired during the flight. First and last time I fly with AA.
4749,"Pensacola to San Francisco. After paying full fare for a toddler in a seat my pregnant daughter was treated so inconsiderately by American Airlines staff. No pre-board because ""there are too many children on this flight"" and they took her stroller away so that she had to carry 2 bags and the child. On one leg of the flight they gave her back the stroller last and nearly made her miss her connection."
4750,One month travel itinerary June 10 - July 8. Point here is not as much about inconvenience as how situations are handled. 4 flights cancelled. One due to weather. Paid upgrades are not refunded if flights cancelled per AA reservations. After 3.5 hour wait little or no information given to waiting passengers in cancellation of first leg OGG-LAX. Restaurant employees saw flight crew leave airport. AA would only help passengers with connections. The rest of us scrambled for flights. Locating luggage was a whole other mishap. 2.5 hr flight from QRO-DFW turned into a 10 hour flight touching down in 2 cities to refuel. Water was being rationed. Children first. No food. No offers from ground crews for additional water or even peanuts. No help with connecting flights. No enough cots in airport Terribly mishandled. Connecting flight missed but cancelled anyway. MCI-OGG delayed 4 hours. Equipment not available. Automated message via phone at 2.30 am for 7.30 am flight. Was auto rebooked on flight out a day later. Called and obtained same day departure. Hoping I get out. Remember when flying used to be fun and airlines treated us with courtesy? Note: Have flown all other US carriers AA is cheaper but savings offset by delay costs incurred other problems and poor treatment.
4751,Flew from Niagara Fall to Clearwater. It was supposed to be a 3 day get away. Waited close to 12 hours on the trip down only to have it cancelled late that night there were no other planes available. The staff at the airport were very accommodating and apologetic however the person who was calling the shots on how to handle the issues missed the ball entirely. We finally got out the next morning. There were quite a few Allegiant planes at the terminal the next morning not sure where they were the day before. Coming home there was another mechanical issue with our plane and we were delayed another 2 hours. We've flown many times and have never experienced any lengthy delays like this one. Our whole trip was book thru Allegiant waiting on rebates hope that comes on time!
4752,"I flew from Ontario CA to Indianapolis IN by way of Dallas TX (round-trip). All 4 planes were MD-80's - I probably don't need to say much more. These planes should have been taken out of service 10 years ago. I was flying them in the early 90's from ORD to LAX they needed to be retired back then. All 4 flights were delayed because of mechanical problems (ranging from inoperative toilets to loose electrical panels). All 4 planes were filthy - not just the rest rooms and aisles - but the seats windows and tray tables were disgusting. All 4 flights were full - so as we sat on the planes waiting for the ""maintenance issues"" to be resolved we roasted. Given that I had a similar experience on a trip from Palm Springs to Cleveland (round trip 4 flight segments) in April on American I should have known better. But as a ""loyal rewards member"" I booked this last flight on American too - hoping for better equipment and on time service. At this point I don't even expect any aspect of comfort on American flights - I just want a safe plane that lands reasonably on time. Given the last 8 flights that I flew on American planes in the last 90 days I'm not even certain that the old MD-80's are safe anymore. When 6 out of 8 of my flights were delayed for mechanical or maintenance issues I begin to wonder I'm going to start building my miles on United. I'm done with American. P.S. - during the last 20 years I have been ""Gold"" ""Platinum"" and in the ""Concierge Key"" program - so I have witnessed the decline of this airline's quality and on- time performance first-hand."
4753,Flight #7943 from Honolulu to Los Angeles April 25 2014. This airline is terrible. The only reason to choose this airline is that they have so many flights to so many locations. But it is as if they don't like to be in flight service. Both my husband and I have been regular flight passengers for most of our adult lives for business and pleasure. Over the years AA has not improved on any level of their service. Since going online for booking we have yet to have reservation that isn't botched in some way. I am sitting on AA plane as I write this as we wait after flying 5.5 hours for a gate to become available. Though this may be an airport error the connections between flights is so short that many passengers are in threat of missing there next flight. We almost missed our connecting to this flight because only 30 minutes was allotted between flights. I would gladly pay more for better service and have but AA has only increased its prices but not improved the quality of service.
4754,"Pensacola to San Francisco. After paying full fare for a toddler in a seat my pregnant daughter was treated so inconsiderately by American Airlines staff that none of us will ever fly with this airline again. No pre-board because ""there are too many children on this flight"" and they took her stroller away so that she had to carry 2 bags and the child. On one leg of the flight they gave her back the stroller last and nearly made her miss her connection. There is no compassion from this airline!"
4755,Flew ANA NH 916 from Bangkok to Narita. The check in process was horrible and the customer service agent didn't know how to switch my seats for me when I requested and instead tried to upgrade me into Business class. There was confusion as to whether I could get lounge access since I was booked in economy but I was showing status as a million mile flyer and a Star Gold. At the gate I was told that the cabin was fairly open and I could move to an open aisle seat. I asked for confirmation and an official change on the ticket but was assured it wouldn't be a problem. Once onboard the chief purser was polite but was obviously very distracted with her colleagues and wasn't able to assist me. When it looked like the majority of people had got onboard I asked the flight attendant if it was ok to change seats and was told it was not possible I would have to do it once we are airborne. When the seat belt light came off I attempted to move seats and was again told to take my original seats. For the price of the ticket and the fact I am a 100K mile flyer on the Star Alliance I was not only exasperated at how little flexibility and competence the flight attendants have to ensuring good customer satisfaction.
4756,"6/20/12. Check in was polite and nice. English not too bad at check-in. It was very obvious that she was not comfortable speaking in English and she ""spoke"" more with sign language than words. Economy line was very long and there was no one to attend to the line. Mentioned I was a Star Alliance Gold member (United 1K) and asked which lounges can I go to. Was told I was in economy and not eligible. I reminded her Star Gold members can go ahead and access lounges and found the lounge on my own where I was welcomed. Inflight service was nothing special. Rather outdated compared to other airlines flying this same route. I asked the Flight Attendant a question on the US Customs Form and she didn't understand what I was asking so she brought the Purser and was told a completely different thing. The food was sub par and cold. For the price paid I am inclined to leave the Star Alliance and travel on Japan Airlines. They have a try harder spirit recently and it feels nice to be appreciated as a frequent flyer instead of being reminded of an economy class ticket. I often fly UAL but thought I would try ANA since I would get the same mileage accrue. For the price paid it was a disaster."
4757,Sanford to South Bend and back. Flight home was Sunday Aug 18th 2013. I do fly this airline but things keep changing and flights getting cancelled. My complaint is that 2 travelers flying together getting tickets at the same time and paying with 1 credit card are put in two different rows. This is 2013 when you can do anything with technology. When I addressed this onboard I was spoken to rudely. My theory is I was being punished for not paying for my seat and other passengers agreed.
4758,Paris to Boston on an old and uncomfortable 757. The worst international business class seat I've ever had. Did anyone from American try sitting in this seat before they selected it? Small personal video screen with terrible resolution and limited choice of films. Food was inedible. The only good about this flight was the crew - friendly and hard working. Luggage took 40 minutes to unload. Overall a terrible experience.
4759,We will never fly with this airline again. Flight out of Moline Il was delayed for an hour because the airplane wasn't there. We finally get a plane and find out from the flight attendant the delay was caused because there was no ramp at their last stop. The pilots did an awesome job getting us to Dallas on time. But then we sat for over an hour waiting to get to a gate. By this time everyone's connecting flights should have left. But we run across the Dallas airport and find out our connecting flight is delayed as well. Seems we didn't have a crew. What a joke. Never again.
4760,"I recently flew from Miami to London. Sat in the economy class. Seat was extremely narrow designed for very slim person. I am 185lbs and 5'11"". For me the seat was very uncomfortable. If you are a large person recommend to buy 2 seats or avoid flying economy. The cabin was very claustrophobic. There was a big wall in front. The quality and the quantity of the food was pathetic. Inedible unless you were real hungry. This airline lowered their standards tremendously. I used 50000 points and paid $68 for this one way flight. In monetary terms approx $700. If the airlines do not stop abusing their passenger I personally will give up long distance flying."
4761,LAX-NRT-LAX on a newly configured 777-300ER and NRT-OKA-NRT on a domestic configured 767-300. ANA has great service and their planes always feel brand new. I was excited to experience their new fixed-back economy seats on the 773ER. Plenty of legroom in the non-reclined position and I love the fact that they configure their 777-300ERs in a 2-4-3 configuration with a double armrest between the pair of four seats. It's also nice not having the person in front of you recline BUT the seats are impossible to sleep in. I won't be flying their Y class again. They're supposed to be introducing a new Prem Econ class soon will look into that next time around. Food was good and plentiful and their flight attendants are spot on. Flights on the domestic 767s were OK enough seat pitch to make a 2 1/2 hour flight bearable. Anything over that might start to get uncomfortable. ANA the fixed-back economy seats didn't work for Cathay and they're certainly not working for you.
4762,My flight from LA to Manila with a stopover in Narita (Tokyo) was extremely uncomfortable in spite of the better seat pitch. The ANA gate is on the extreme edge of the LAX a 10 minute walk from Bradley terminal. Then from the gate you'll have to get a bus - another 10 minutes - to another stand-alone gate structure out in the runway area to board. The cabin was very hot and the seats have no individual air conditioning control. Throughout the 11 hrs flight the florescent light overhead was left on at all times which made it difficult to nap or sleep. The transfer in Narita was also a nightmare. There was a long line to another security check plus another 10 minutes walk and 3 floors down to board the connecting flight to Manila. I've flown several airlines to cities in US Europe and Asia and this is by far the most uncomfortable flight experience I ever had.
4763,A week ago our daughter and granddaughter travelled on a direct flight from LAX to Billings MT. They were to arrive at 8.05pm. They arrived at 1.50am. A 6 hour delay. They were given $8 in food vouchers. Since we are an hour from the airport we didn't get to bed until 3.30am. Shockingly enough just 7 days later on their return flight yesterday they were again delayed. This time 7 hours! They were supposed to leave at 8.05pm but were delayed until 2.50am. They didn't arrive home until 7.45am. This time they got $8 food vouchers and $50 trip vouchers which are useless as we will never use this airline again.
4764,We recently took our family to Maui to celebrate our 48th anniversary. My husband is in his 70's as I am and he has Parkinson's disease. I have recently had a knee replacement so we rented a hotel for the park and fly program as did our daughter's family for a total of $475 so there would be no chance of us being late for our plane which was to leave at 10.35 am. We arrived early as were told to do. Eventually we found that there was a delay of at least 30 minutes. The delay continued to be extended and ended up being a 9 hour wait. AA reps told us there was nothing they could do. The seats are firm plastic with no head rest or place to lean against the wall. We were given a lunch voucher which we used but were never offered a dinner voucher. We became more and more frustrated as time progressed. We finally left for a long flight to Maui with a crew who were unhappy to called out on Father's Day on an unexpected flight. Their attitude reflected that. We were not given anything to compensate for all our problems no free drinks no food. Nothing. We got to our hotel at 3.30 am. On our trip home we were held up because someone had thrown up in the seat but it wasn't cleaned up by the cleaning crew. There was vomit on the seats and in the buckle making it necessary to take off all seat covering and taking out and putting in all new seatbelt apparatus. To top this all off we are AA frequent flyers!
4765,What a horrible product AA offers in the back of the plane for longer flights. I flew from Manaus to Miami overnight and could not get comfortable in the nasty thin under padded seats. The meal service was a soggy ham sandwich and a glutinous dessert while the entertainment was provided by screens that dropped down from the ceilings. Even small Air Canada planes have seat back TVs but American's 737s do not and this on a 5-hour flight. When they dimmed the cabin lights the screens kept playing the film so good luck trying to get any sleep with the flashing lights in your eyes. Awful just awful. It is a throwback to the 1990s.
4766,I recently booked a 9.30am trip to Amarillo through American Airlines (booked it 2 months in advance). The morning of the flight at about 6.30am (while I was headed to the airport) I was called by American Airlines and it was an automated voice recording telling me that my flight had been cancelled and they automatically put me on a 6.30pm flight that night. I had no option to talk to anyone or hear a reasoning on the scenario that was taking place. I had to call back and go through various automated conversations until I finally reached someone. After explaining the situation (and no sympathy was shown) I realized the person could not help me and did not desire to help me. Little did she know I had major wedding events to get to at my destination (hints why I booked an early flight in the first place). I ended up having to book another flight through Southwest Airlines last minute (costing me a fortune) just to make it to the city in time. It was an all around awful experience dealing with an impersonal system that left me without answers paying a fortune and still arriving later than I planned. I will never again try to fly American Airlines.
4767,SIN-NRT-LAX. The seats from SIN-NRT were very small almost unbearable for a 7 hour flight. Food was quite ok but one thing to note about ANA is that their service is excellent. The flight from NRT-LAX was a lot better with a bigger aircraft and much more legroom. Their seats do not really recline but slide forward something I didn't really mind with ample leg room on my NRT-LAX flight but was a huge problem for the smaller aircraft. Overall I guess you get what you pay for and it's quite an affordable choice. I think their flights to the US (and from) are the bigger planes so try to avoid ANA if you're flying within Asia I suppose. Otherwise recommended!
4768,I couldn't believe how small the seats were and I'm not a big guy. The food was pretty bad as most airline food is but this was beyond that. Plane was very clean and if I didn't have an exit row seat I would have jumped out of the plane. Staff was very attentive and efficient. As soon as I was notified I had a flight on ANA I registered as a frequent flyer and this is where you can choose your seats not through United where I booked my award flight.
4769,HKG-NRT return. If you are tall Y class is very small the seat does not recline it slides so you end up with your knees in the seat in front. Still very bearable for a 4 hour flight. The food is good and varied as an economy product. It beats business class fare of many western airlines! I have a gluten free meal which was very nice. The crew make you feel welcome. A little less public announcements which are inaudible anyway would be welcome indeed.
4770,On our return flight from Orlando to DFW we arrived early to the massive lines at security. Got through and sat down for an early dinner flight delayed. Took our time then another notice flight delayed again. Finally left dinner and walked around got to out terminal flight delayed again. So our 7pm take off was now leaving at 9pm. Sat down and watched TV. Then some people started standing up and getting upset flight now delayed until 11.45pm. Our plane arrived but had to wait on a crew to fly us. Finally got on the plane after midnight and waited another hour on the plane. We were told we might not have enough fuel. Really? The plane had been there at the airport for 3 hours and no one checked to refuel it? Got back to DFW at 2.30am. Only one baggage person there at that time and several bags were missing. 30 minutes waiting to get our bag that came in at an early flight. So 8 hours in the airport and all the explanation we got was it was DFW's fault. Never again.
4771,Flew on the newly refurbished 777-300 from Los Angeles to Tokyo-Narita. Check-in was slow. Flight attendants were extremely helpful with my requests and remained consistent in their service. Two meals served and they were both good. The same cannot be said of the seats though as it was not possible to recline them but only have them slide forward which made sleeping impossible. I agree with other reviews with regards to inflight entertainment as it can feel redundant after a couple of hours. Great service and a good enough inflight product.
4772,Pasco to Las Vegas 3x to Mesa 2x and Los Angeles 2x. You don't fly Allegiant if you expect comfortable seats warm service or even being on time. It's a relatively inexpensive ride that's all. Bring your own drinks and food. Get to the airport a couple hours before the flight. Don't show up with overweight bags. Expect flight delays. Expect skeletal staff that's worked to the bone doing multiple tasks. Don't fly Allegiant if it's a really significant trip like attending a wedding or going to Hawaii. Don't get same-day-as-flight show tickets in Vegas. If you play defence like that and expect nothing more than bare minimum no frills travel then Allegiant isn't a bad way to fly. The longest delay I ever had was a 3 hour delay leaving Pasco for Vegas. It killed that evening there but we hadn't booked and shows that evening either. Just flew to Los Angeles this past weekend. Short acceptable delay going down. Return flight an hour delay because they initially didn't have a flight crew. That was a new one. But they flew faster and we arrived only 45 min late which is essentially on-time for Allegiant.
4773,Narita - LAX June 25 First Class. A totally acceptable experience except for boarding and off loading. See my previous review for service comments. Boarding for a First class really needs an upgrade first class passengers deserve more. LAX arrival was unacceptable. Remote gate (ok that happens) but first class passengers were herded onto a packed bus for the ride to terminal. Come on not even a special bus for first and business pax? Not a way to get or keep premium passengers.
4774,June 15-19 supposed to depart from Knoxville to Dallas to Las Vegas but were made to drive from Knoxville to Nashville. Route ended up being Nashville to Dallas to Las Vegas and vice versa. Our flight was changed several times by the airline before departure date. On the date of departure we received an automated phone call 3 hours before take off notifying us that our plane was delayed 4 hours. This interfered with our connecting flight and there was not another flight that would have us reaching our destination until the next day. I contacted the airline immediately and they confirmed that if they re-routed us we could reach our destination. We agreed to this and proceeded to the airport. Upon arrival we were unable to check in. An hour later it was discovered that when re-routing us the person had neglected to issue us a ticket and now our flight was over booked. Our only option was to drive 2.5 hours to another airport catch a flight there and then have 15 minutes between connecting flights that we were to try and get to the gate and board in time. Somehow we managed to make it and made it to our destination. On our return trip we again couldn't check in and had to see an attendant. Everyone we encountered was extremely rude and hateful. I will never fly American Airlines again.
4775,NRT-ORD March 2012 Boeing 773. ANA desperately needs to update their AVOD entertainment system. There is no excuse for airlines not to have the touch-screen system with larger screens. Still using the 1990s version where one channel = one movie. Plane was clean but didn't seem new.
4776,I have flown Allegiant about 8 times in the last 18 months. It is a great deal when everything goes according to plan. I think in the last few months there have been more and more problems. And to have your flight cancelled and rescheduled for the next day after waiting in an airport for 5-7 hours is extremely poor customer service. Staff seems to do the best they can under the circumstances. Lately I have not been getting very good rates either by the time everything is added in. I'm back to flying Delta.
4777,Great for the price. Even with the extra charges for baggage stored in overhead and paying the small fee for a selected seat to ensure we all sat together the total cost per person was still half compared to using a major airline. We flew from Mesa AZ to Rochester MN round trip and there was only about a 30 minute delay at departure and about a 45 minute delay for the return flight. You can also save on baggage fees by paying a head on line any time before check-in. For only a 2.5-3 hour flight the tight seating was bearable. I would hope for a longer flight that they use a larger airplane with more room for comfort.
4778,If you're looking for a company that will fly you in the least comfort at the highest price then look no further ??you found it. It is inconceivable that American Airlines are still flying old planes with no individual entertainment systems on their transatlantic crossing and charging more than anyone else for the privilege. They didn't even show the film they advertised. We only flew from JFK to Buffalo (with a rival company) a flight of just over an hour and they had individual entertainment screens. To add insult to injury AA ran an ad telling us all how they are adding a new plane every week to their fleet! All I can say is watch out AA when Thomson starts flying the Dreamliner from Manchester to JFK in May 2015 I do not predict a very prosperous future for them.
4779,I booked a flight from LAX to Raleigh-Durham NC. 24 hours before the flight I went on the AA web site to 'Check- in' and obtain my 'Boarding Pass'. When I selected the option to check-in I was asked if I wanted to select a seat. I elected yes and was presented which several options for only 'Paid Seats' at $86/per seat. Thinking there were no other options I selected a seat and paid the $86 for both the departing and return trips. After making and paying $172 for seats the web site asked if I wanted my boarding pass. I said yes and I was offered the option for seat selections that required no extra fee. Feeling set-up wondering why I was not offered options for all available seats from the beginning I called the AA Customer service group and the agent informed me that they could not do anything about changing my seat to one that did not require an extra fee. I then wrote them to ask why I was lead into believing I could only purchase a seat when free seats were available they simply said 'you made the decision to purchase the seat and therefore there is nothing that can do'. After this frustrating experience on the outbound flight I requested a 'bloody mary mix' just after the stewardess handed one to the stewardess covering the first class group. I was informed that they no longer had any more. Things on the return flight were equally as bad. I was unable to print a boarding pass - web message said my reservation had been cancelled. When I attempted to call the customer service group at 11.00 pm EDT the auto attendant informed me that wait time to talk with an agent was 35 minutes. Needless to say after these experiences I will never fly this airline again.
4780,SFO-NRT on B777-300. Upon boarding the cabin looked new and clean but the niceness ended there. ANA's new fixed-back economy seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have had the misfortune to sit in. The legroom was not great but once the seat slouched forward the legroom became non-existent. FAs were polite and had a permanent rather fake-looking smile plastered their faces the entire flight. The first meal service was tasty and filling. The second meal was Western and not very good. The seat-back PTVs were good-sized however the selection of entertainment mostly Japanese/East Asian.
4781,Nice service attitude affordable clean bathrooms and sometimes decent food. However the flight attendants have poor English language skills. I had to translate what they said to many other Americans during the flight. On another flight (Japan to Taiwan) flight attendants don't even speak Mandarin/Chinese which makes me wonder why because many Chinese people travel that flight route. The food varies each time. I had great in flight meals in early 2011 (April-June) but towards the end of 2011 the food got worse in quality. Hope they can improve in 2012. Their economy seats are uncomfortable. The seats do not recline at all do not recommend for long flights.
4782,We have just completed a round trip from the UK to USA two transatlantic flights and three internal flights. The first from London to Dallas was characterised by dreadful food (lunch being served immediately after an early morning take-off!) with very unfriendly and ungracious staff. The second flight from Dallas to El Paso was delayed for an hour at El Paso where we sat on the tarmac for an hour in temperatures of c.110F because of a failed air conditioning unit. Offered not so much as a glass of water. The delay meant that the car hire desk we were using was closed at El Paso. The second internal flight was from El Paso to Phoenix. This time the flight was delayed because the 'pontoon bridge' attaching the plane to the terminal was broken. Again we sat on the tarmac without refreshment. Again surly and uncooperative staff. We were sat at the back of the plane when drinks were finally offered there was very little choice left and no time to enjoy them. The third flight from Las Vegas to New York was relatively uneventful tho' with ungracious and charmless grumpy staff. The food on board was expensive terrible and tasteless. The final flight was delayed more than 2 hours at take off and just under two hours at landing. No staff would tell us what was going on the plane was changed and we were forced to split up our family seats and had to sit in different places on the plane. The food was inedible. Staff were not only surly but extremely rude. In all instances the planes were old shabby and dirty with worn through upholstery and carpets defective lavatories inflight entertainment was broken reading lights did not work fresh air vents that would not open or close and the worst cabin staff I have experienced.
4783,June 12 AA169 LAX-NRT F Class. Nowadays one has quite high expectations for International First Class while adequate American met none of those expectations. On all levels it met international business class standards and no more. Cabin crew was friendly but not very visible between meals. Better off in business on JAL United Singapore or even Delta. Quite a let down.
4784,June 11 2014 flight 1322 Liberia Costa Rica to MIA. Worst experience ever! On our return aircraft had an engine problem delayed flight for 4 hours missed connecting flight in MIA to NYC because of this issue. Arrived at MIA at 12am and next flight was at 6am upon leaving same engine issue flight delayed 2 more hours. On top of the fact that their aircraft's are not inspected they offer no food not even a bag of chips and there's no wifi even though they say they provide it. I travel twice every year will never fly with them again!
4785,I just completed a multi city international round trip with American. 2 international flights and 3 domestic. So the international (from South America to Miami) was an overnight flight. The plane was old and the ceiling TVs stayed on all night. No sleep. All of my domestic flights were either delayed re-routed or cancelled. The first from Tampa to DFW was cancelled due to no oxygen. To top it off at my final destination back in South America one bag was delayed (hopefully not lost) as it was accidentally put on a LAN flight to Lima. 5 days later I am still waiting for it.
4786,"I flew from Manchester Airport to JFK in economy class. From the start the aircraft was very dated and did not smell particularly clean. The food was dull unappetising and almost thrown at you by the staff drinks were not offered except with the meal I had to beg a member of staff for a bottle of water on the journey. The IFE was very poor the TV was attached to the ceiling above the aisle so from my window seat I couldn't see the full screen so didn't get any IFE. On the return journey the same 4 episodes of ""Salvage Hunters"" was shown on a loop so repeated 3 times during the 7 hour flight. The seats were uncomfortable and very cramped on the return flight the passenger in front had his seat back which meant for a very claustrophobic journey. The most startling aspect to flying with American Airlines was the rudeness of the staff! I went to the toilet and an exiting a member of staff had started serving lunch she kept shouting at me to not stand close to her (which I was not) and in the end marched me to my seat and demanded I ""sit now"". On the return I had to plead for a drink only to get a very aggressive member of staff thrust a can of juice at me before saying ""now go sit down"". After booking with BA I was disappointed to find AA codeshare and operate the flight as I was not prepared for the awful aircraft used the lack of IFE the poor quality food and the stunningly nasty approach by the cabin crew. Would never choose or recommend this airline."
4787,We started in BWI with 4 delays totalling 4 hours. We finally made it to DFW and have been sitting on tarmac for almost a half hour now just a perfect end to horrible trip with AA. Tried calling customer service with a seat issue before flight and the woman hung up on me. I actually got 2 voice messages on the first 2 delays. I will not fly AA again.
4788,Bangkok-Narita-San Francisco. Inflight service excellent on both sectors with a good selection of food. Narita- San Francisco had the new staggered layout which is very comfortable. However the transfer at Narita was terrible. Only two out of the three security stations were staffed. Stood in line waiting to go through the transfer security check for over 45 minutes. By the time I was through security the San Francisco flight was already boarding and I was unable to use the lounge. With ANA adding more international flights out of Narita I can imagine that this is only going to get worse.
4789,"NRT to IAD. Excellent service great on-demand entertainment. Exceptionally small economy seats. According to Seatguru the seats are 2"" thinner than most airlines and you can definitely feel it. For such long flights I suggest choosing SQ or UA instead of ANA."
4790,Booked 3 passengers at the same time from Mesa to Duluth. Each seat was in a different row. Seriously? Another way to get you to pay money. Flight left at 6.45 am - we were told that once we were at altitude they would be coming around with the snack cart where all items were for sale however no coffee or tea but they had a full assortment of alcoholic beverages. Really? I can't get coffee but I can buy a beer? No thanks! No delays on the flight but waited for an hour for our bags at baggage claim. Spend the extra money and fly another airline.
4791,I get that this is a bare bones service but when an airline resorts to intentionally separating people because they didn't pay to choose a seat that's going too far. Not only that on a 2/3 full aircraft (both ways) they wouldn't let us move. This was on a flight between Bellingham and Honolulu in January 2013 and instead of impressing us with their value they were mean spirited in an attempt to extort a few more bucks. We won't fly Allegiant again.
4792,Upon arrival at DFW airport my flight was supposed to depart at 10.20 pm. The flight was delayed several times and finally canceled at 12.00 am. Hotels were not offered the only option was to sleep in the airport. The next flight to my destination was scheduled for 7.30 am the following morning. At 7.20 am the next morning we learned that they had no pilot for the flight delayed again. I am very dissatisfied with AA customer service and I will no longer be flying with this company.
4793,Flew ORD-MIA on April 20th. The overall experience was very average. We flew American with miles and because United's flights to South Florida are infrequent and poorly timed and AA has a lot more options. All crew that I encountered didn't seem like they cared. The flight arrived on time and bags were waiting that the carousel. The aircraft flown was a 737-800 and the seats were surprisingly comfortable. Wifi was very good and it was only 7 or 8 dollars. The north terminal at Miami is very long and if you are making a connection allot extra time.
4794,Flights both ways from Vegas to RFD and back went well. Flight out was on time. Plane was clean and seats were comfortable. Staff very friendly and courteous. Experienced good communication from staff and pilots re: gate change need for full runway slightly warmer cabin until engines full on and longer taxiing and delay about an hour on return flight. Airline does charge for both carryon and checked bags and food/beverages but this is mentioned on their website. Smaller plane so important carry on baggage meets their specifications which is listed on their website. I had no problems re: carryon checking in and printing online boarding pass. Overall a good experience with them. Would fly them again.
4795,"I just took this trip in fact I arrived back home last night. The trip out: went online to get boarding passes had to choose my seats (two flights). I chose my seat for the first flight no problem. Chose my seat for the second flight: $28 later I had both boarding passes. Silly me I expected when I bought my ticket that I would have a seat without paying extra not so I was in a so called ""upgrade"" seat which I didn't ask for nor did I want but that was all that was left. I did not get anything extra for having paid for a so called ""upgraded"" seat. I had to do the same thing on the return trip. Also you have to pay for your luggage. On the return trip I purchased a sandwich for $9.99 which was most definitely the worst sandwich I have ever had. I will fly Southwest when in need of a flight you purchase a fare from them you not only have a seat that you don't have to pay extra for your first bag is free."
4796,I normally fly Southwest exclusively - so you can imagine the culture shock when I found myself booked (by my company) on an American flight from SFO to JFK. The only thing I can say positively is that the food was really fantastic quite unexpected for in-flight cuisine. The drinks also came very consistently. The crew were not unpleasant but not quite up to the standards of the Southwest culture. And for a completely redesigned seat the Business Class seat was the most uncomfortable thing I have endured. I am 5'1 so my feet never touched the floor. I tried every adjustment on the panel but nothing worked. Finally I just used my provided pillow to stuff behind me to make my feet touch the floor. Between that and the leg rest I was able to get a little sleep on the way home. There was no indication of how to use the video screen in front of me or any explanation of how to operate the headphone (where the jack was located etc.) or anything. I stopped flying American about 12 years ago and now I remember why.
4797,St Pete to Allentown PA we were delayed 2 hours and had to deplane bad weather was ahead. We understand that but then we were put back on the plane and it was thunder and lightning and we were delayed another 1.5 hrs onboard arriving 3.5 hours late. On our return flight 5 days later arrived to be told of a 2 hour delay finally they pushed up the time for boarding after 1.5 hours and we were in the air close to our destination an announcement was made that we could not land in St Pete Fl and would have to go to Tampa and they would shuttle us to St Pete. There was no organization and I and 3 others waited forever for a wheelchair and then had no one to push them. We finally got going about an hour later and couldn't even find any shuttle buses so we had to rent car in Tampa.
4798,LAX to Phoenix. We were really unhappy with the customer service of American Airlines employees at LAX. We had a flight coming into LAX run really late and were bumped to a later flight the next day. We arrived to the airport at 8.00 and our flight to Phoenix was departing at 9.25. I usually arrive to airports about 1.5 hours before a domestic flight and this is usually plenty of time. We checked in at the kiosk but the computer would not print the bag tags. We grabbed an airline employee who directed us to a baggage check line for others with issues with the printing. It was only four people deep so we were not too worried. After about 20 minutes and the line had barely moved we started to become nervous. We tried talking to a couple agents about taking our bags from us and sticking them on a later flight so we could still make it to our gate. They were all at the most apathetic and kept telling us there was nothing they could do. By the time we finally got to the counter we had been in line 45 minutes. There were two employees working this whole time even though the process seemed to be incredibly slow. This inefficient system and lacking customer service caused us to miss our flight. Maybe I would think this was normal airline behavior but we have flown with Alaskan airlines in LAX when a connecting flight caused us to come in late. Their employees were very helpful took our bags and sent them on a later flight and even pushed us through security to ensure we made the plane. In the end I will never chose American again if I can help it.
4799,Upon checking in at my starting location I was informed by the AA rep that my flight was being delayed an hour to leave for O'Hare which was a problem as my connecting flight was to leave an hour and 10 minutes after arriving at O'Hare which turned into one mess up after another which would have had me reaching my final destination 2.5+ hrs after scheduled. I reached O'Hare (more delays) and eventually walked out of the airport and took a charter bus reaching my destination before the flight even left Chicago! Avoid American Airlines travelers.
4800,"MIA to LGA flight. It started with a mechanical problem with the plane's intercom which they spent 2 hours trying to fix before looking for another plane. Another plane found boarded and headed to the runway around 7pm. We waited on the runway for 1.5 hours because of ""weather"" (even though other flights on the same route were taking off) then told we had to go back to the gate. One flight attendant then got into a screaming match with a passenger (extremely unprofessional) while I waited with an upset baby for 15 minutes in the roasting hot gangway because they couldn't find anyone to bring up the gate-checked strollers. Finally the ""weather"" was okay to allow us to leave but a new crew was needed we finally left around 11.30pm. And then because LGA was closed it landed at JFK instead. Nothing positive to say about this airline. To be avoided if at all possible."
4801,Business Class trip Tokyo to Dallas. Attendants were rude! It was 45 minutes after take off before we were given audio headsets and 45 minutes before landing they gathered them up. My husband's didn't work and it was a chore to get a replacement pair. We felt like we were intruding on their day! Beverage service was a joke. This was a 12 hour flight and we were given beverages 4 times. We flew first class on various Asian airlines and the service was excellent. I will not fly American again!
4802,I've been flying for over 30 years and I have never come close to missing a flight. In April 14 I travelled with American from Miami to Washington DC and their awful check in staff caused my group to miss our flight. There was a cut off check-in time of 9.13am and we arrived about 8.55am and were told not to go the counter but to use self- check-in. We did this and when it came to finalising the check-in the system cancelled our check-in. Again we went to the oh-so-friendly staff which said go to the counter as it will be quick and there is not queue. Went to the counter and by the time we had got through the queue we were 3 mins past our check-in time. The staff couldn't have carried less and just flat out refused to help even thigh it was their fault. We were told that we needed to book in 2hrs before the flight but not only was this not listed on our ticket but our pre-printed boarding passes had 9.13am. I've got no apologies form the company and was left with missing our afternoon in Washington.
4803,KIX to ICN on A320 Economy Class. Knowing that it is only a very short flight I didn't expect much for the inflight service. Out of my expectation I enjoyed an excellent inflight service given it is a four-star airline. Playing cards postcards and writing kits were available on request. Gifts were proactively given to young travellers by cabin crew. The crew were very friendly and helpful. The ANA special drink which claimed to be made from Kyushu orange was pretty good. However a fast decent meal instead of just a snack will be better. ANA's service might not be comparable to those of SQ but definitely comparable and even better than some 5-star airlines. They are close to 5-star status.
4804,American is the worst airline I have been on. I'm sitting in the plane after boarding in Chicago having to de- board due to an oil leak after 30 minutes waiting the maintenance have the all clear took off then the pilot came over the speaker saying we need to turn back land and de-board again switch gates then it gets delayed for an hour after they told us there was an immediate plane waiting. By far the worst and stressful experience I have ever had. I will never fly with American again.
4805,We flew from Las Vegas to JFK New York on 23rd May this year with American Airlines and we have never encountered such rude and unhelpful flight attendants. It was a 4.5 hour flight and they only came round with the drinks trolley once at the beginning of the flight and when I asked for some water was told that she wasn't there to run round after me! I was horrified but told her that I would follow her down to the galley and get my own water so she stormed off and brought me one back. The whole flight she was abrupt and rude. There were 6 of us in the party on holiday in 3 separate cities in USA. That was the only one where we encountered rude and nasty staff.
4806,"IAD-NRT-IAD in First both aircraft were equipped with the old ""new"" product. Leaves a lot to be desired. There's basically no at-seat storage. I like that it's so easy to move the tray out of the way while you're eating though. Bed was a very thin mattress pad to put over the seat with a duvet on top. I had the Kaiseki meal and it was very good. Flight attendants very good and spoke English but their accent was so thick that it was very hard to understand them."
4807,"NRT-SIN on Economy. Rebooked by SQ as my original SQ flight had been delayed and thus would likely miss my connection in Singapore. B767-300ER not new it was well maintained. The inflight service was decent and for those who flies on ANA only may satisfied with it. As I usually fly on SQ on NRT-SIN during the same time of the day there was a significant difference in inflight service. While SQ serves a lunch and a snack on 7 hour service ANA serves a lunch only. In addition SQ gives ice-cream for free ANA charges 350 yen as ""ANA Selection"". As ANA tickets to SIN sold in Japan are relatively more expensive than those of SQ I would choose SQ in the future."
4808,MXP-JFK return in economy. Boeing 767-300 was comfortable and silent service just okay seats cramped food too limited for a long range flight both inbound and outbound. Inflight entertainment just OK. Asked for upgrading purchase on return flight at check-in and was told from AA lady at counter the price was USD 7000 one way - unbelievable what a joke! Avoid AA from Milan fly Delta or Emirates.
4809,NRT-MNL and back. Airline interiors seats carpet blankets were clean. Seats were a bit stiff though. Toilets were well-stocked and well-maintained. Cabin crew though appeared distant were accommodating and attentive. Some announcements made in perfect Tagalog which was pleasant to hear. Airline offers the latest magazine issues of famous titles in English and Japanese. Big disappointment was the food. The presentation looked very nice with the glass plates and delectable. But the main course was too sweet and too tangy. Good thing the appetizers were better.
4810,Boeing 777-300 GRU-JFK First Class. True waste of money or miles until crew's sense of premium service matches product. Last night First Class service in my flight was a joke : from the warm champagne to the traffic of crew members congregated in the service area socializing quite loudly in the middle of the night; to the dirty wine glass. Unpleasant main dish and Breakfast service so rushed that it felt as if it was coach. Do not seat in 2A as crew will bother you with the curtain hitting your seat every time they march between cabins (all night long). Great product but substandard service. Stay in business.
4811,The food was ghastly. Dallas Fort Worth to London breakfast was a measly white bread bun bare on the tray (no plate or even plastic) with butter and cheese with a small tub of yoghurt and a small orange juice. The dinner chicken tasted awful. The service from the cabin staff was abrupt and short. Some hand wipes at meal times would be great as the toilets left much to be desired. Also at meal times they would not remind passengers to put their chairbacks up like the attendants on the other airlines I mostly use. I think Qatar Airways is doing itself a disservice by aligning with American Airlines on code share flights. I particularly booked with Qatar Airways as their service is always impeccable.
4812,If there was a way to rate this company's service to a score less than 1 I would do that. I booked my flight all confirmed connecting through Chicago. In Chicago after a gate change and an hour delay they cancelled the flight to my destination. No options no direction just cancelled. Then after 30 min on the call I talked to them for rebooking. Nothing available. I got someone at a kiosk to help and they booked me on a flight 2 DAYS later whereas I had to be at a conference the next morning. Needless to say that was not an option. I rented a car and drove 10 hours straight to my destination getting to my destination at 4am. Then it is time to get back home and they tell me they have canceled my return ticket because I did not complete my trip. No warning no notification nothing. Just cancelled. So I had to pay for another ticket to get back home. There were many people like me on that plane. People from across the world who couldn't even speak English and they were lost and confused. I ended up helping one of them. There is no excuse for this. This is the worst none customer service oriented company I have ever dealt with. Avoid this airline by all means even if you have to pay a little more to go with another airline.
4813,LHR-NRT-LHR. Staff were helpful on outward journey always around to to help. At the inbound it wasn't the case. They looked tired lacking of sleep and seem to disappear for prolonged periods! Food excellent for special meal. The rest no different than other airlines and short of JAL. Online booking facility a bit outdated. Seat selection facility in flash always crashing. The worst with ANA there is no area to leave feedback online no proper call centre with extended hours. Basically if you miss 17:30 you are stuffed. I find it very absurd especially that they operate in other countries with different time zones to be able to offer 24h telephone support! If you encounter problems paying online then there is no other way to pay via phone. If you are impatient please look for other airlines.
4814,"We flew Toronto to Chicago; paid almost $700 per ticket which was very expensive considering it was an 1.5 hour flight. When we booked the flight we thought it was through WestJet as it was advertised that way but in small writing at the bottom it said operated by American Airlines which we didn't see when we booked the flight otherwise we wouldn't have booked it. We had a very bad experience with AA a few years ago and refused to book any more flights with them. This time both flights were delayed. When returning they had oversold so my sister and I volunteered to take a later flight. That wasn't the issue. The issue was the incompetence of the staff; it took them an hour and a half to figure out how to give us our vouchers which is ridiculous because they told us we couldn't leave the gate until they gave us the voucher so we couldn't even go and have dinner or anything. On top of that the rep there kept saying she had no idea what she was doing and this was her first time doing vouchers - then get someone who knows what they're doing rather than wasting an hour just trying to figure it out yourself doesn't give us a lot of confidence in your abilities. Other issue was that they kept changing the gate to the flight (it was changed 4 times no exaggeration) and when we would go up to the desk to make sure it was there every person at the desk was extremely rude and one actually said to us ""can't you read the monitor?"" and when we explained that our ticket had a different number than what was on the monitor they gave us a dirty look and said that what they had was right (it wasn't in the end which is pathetic). it would be nice that if you were going to change the gates; at least inform people and let them know. Another minor thing was with the flight attendant she was grabbing something from the bin above my sister and her bag kept hitting my sister's head several times; and she wouldn't even apologize even though she saw it happening; she just gave us a look like how dare you sit there and be in my way when she was the one who was in our way. Very rude and terrible customer service. Will never fly again; I am not even going to use my voucher because that would mean I would have to travel again with this airline."
4815,"Was delayed out of DFW to SAT last night because after a long (DFW) taxi to the runway for take off we were informed that there was an issue with one of the computers. We were all curios as to why we got so close to being in the air before this ""issue"" was noticed - it is pretty obvious it wasn't Pilot error they completey felt our pain as did the flight attendants and gate workers. Of course we were re-booking a whole (S80) plane so it was obvius that we would have to wait for a plane to dead head. Fortunately that didn't take too long and we were just 2 hours late getting into SAT. Cudos to Capt Smith and his first officer for getting us home safely and the flight attendants that had to be dead on their feet undoubtably they all had a very stressful evening."
4816,Hope to never fly American Airlines again. I Was flying from Wichita KS to Dallas to my final destination Las Vegas on 5/18/2014. Our 3:00 flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Things happen so that was not a big deal how the situation was handled is my issue. All passengers with a connecting flight from Dallas was asked to stand in line there were about 40 to 50 passengers in line. There 2 American Airlines Rep working the counters needless to say they were very rude and short. They acted as if they were the one with the problem. They acted as if they did not care if the passengers found a connecting flight or not. I stood in line from approx 1:30 pm to 4:15pm well over 2 hours. Each Rep spent an average of 20 to 30 minutes per customer. At 4:15 2 more Reps appeared from the back however they did not have a clue what they were doing. The first guy told me that all Dallas flights were full and there was nothing available until the next morning and when I arrived in Dallas they would arrange for a hotel for the night. The person in line behind me; also going to Vegas was assisted by a different Rep who manage to find a flight for her and her 3 children. So I went back to the counter and spoke to a different Rep who was then able to find me a flight home that night. Needless to say this whole situation was very stressful and left a very bad reflection on American Airlines.
4817,"LAX-NRT Business. Totally disappointed. When boarding in LAX I requested a glass of water that was delivered to me 1 hour into flight. when complained was told that USA security regulations forbid serving liquids on ground. This was confirmed by the business class purser! Food very good flight attendants smiling but did not have any English skills. Ordered Champagne and white wine comes. Order white wine red comes. Seats very old and worn out and uncomfortable. When talking to the chief purser she answers ""this is ANA!"". No amenity kit for a 12 hour flight ! A typical lack of consistence of the star alliance!"
4818,"First and last time I will fly AA. Was ""bumped"" off original flight without being asked just told ""sorry you are now on next flight"". Next flight was supposed to be in 35 mins. I told flight attendant that if the flight was late I would miss my connecting flight she said ""sorry I don't make the rules"". Gentleman beside me said he would gladly wait for next flight as he didn't have a connection to make. She said ""no sorry"". Of course the flight was delayed and I missed my connection in Chicago. Once in Chicago I was told the next available flight was the next morning and no hotel or food voucher would be provided as it was an ""ATC"" issue not a AA issue on why there was a delay. What is ATC I asked - Air Traffic Control. AA had lots of people ""sleeping"" in O'Hare airport and it really was sad when you see seniors in wheelchairs having to sleep in their wheelchair because the cot they received was too low to the floor for them to lay down. Then the kicker is at 4am security is yelling wake up time to move along sleep time is over get moving. As I said first and last time I and many others will be travelling on AA."
4819,When we arrived at the airport all of the other airlines had fairly short check-in queues American Airlines filled up their queue and had a line going 30 yards down the hallway. It seemed that their computers must have shut down because the line wasn't moving. It took us two hours to get checked-in and check our bags. We would have been late for our flight but it was delayed anyway. The delay was over an hour and once we did get on the flight the seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. Our delayed flight caused us to only have 30 minutes to catch our connecting flight- which ended up leaving 10 minutes early (I am not making this up)- meaning we missed it. They issued us tickets for the next flight 3 hours later. We had confirmed seats on the ticket and everything but when we went to board the plane our tickets got flagged as invalid and we were told by the attendant that we were actually in standby- the plane ended up being full and we were not allowed on. So at this point my wife (7 months pregnant) is about to lose it and they tell us we can possibly fly out at 9 PM that evening. We do make that flight and arrive at our destination at midnight missing our evening plans and exhausting us. Again the flight itself was awful. I had taken 4 advil at this point and still had back pain. Never again American Airlines never again.
4820,"Connecting flight from Dallas to Knoxville cancelled for ""maintenance"". Customer Service agents were clueless and basically no help and really not concerned that the flight was cancelled. Stayed in airport for 5 hours attempting to get on another flight via standby with no luck. Once it was determined I was stuck in Dallas they provided vouchers for a place to stay (can't call it a hotel) and $19 worth of food with the next flight out the next day. After waiting for the shuttle for an hour we finally were on our way for a good nights rest or so we thought. Once we arrived it was obvious this was a pay by the hour motel called ""The Night Hotel"". Wow This place was basically a brothel built around a night club. The next morning we were waiting on our 5 AM cab ride to the airport and 4 prostitutes came walking through the door. Bottom line I can't believe American Airlines had the audacity to do what they did."
4821,Return trip from Tokyo to London and first experience of ANA's new in-flight service offering. In-flight service was extremely poor with unappetizing food and audio-video entertainment selection very limited when compared to that of competing carriers. In flight cuisine was limited with offerings such as hot-dogs and plates of ham. Despite the poor service and product now offered ANA charge an unjustified premium over other airlines. In future I will certainly be looking at other carriers.
4822,"Cancun-Dallas Had a connecting flight from Dallas to Toronto which was delayed for several hours then ultimately cancelled due to ""a missing captain"". We had to re-book with an extremely rude and unsympathetic Customer Service Agent who told us that the next available flight was 10 am the next morning. We were traveling for a total of 36 hours. We were offered no compensation for the cancellation no apologies no Hotel or Meal vouchers. We had to sleep at the airport on a chair. Needless to say we will no longer ever use American Airlines to fly."
4823,LHR-MIA-LIM-MIA in economy. I expected a poor experience and with the exception of the first leg in the 777-300 they lived up to expectations. Old aircraft with technical issues on both MIA-LIM and LIM-MIA leading to delays in both directions inedible food unfriendly and unsmiling flight attendants dirty interiors cramped seating and no attempt to be of any help. Ate nothing as my vegetarian food requests had been overlooked/ignored (despite it being on my ticket) no apology or attempt to offer an alternative. Overall a very poor partner to BA. The score of 3 is awarded because of the LHR-MIA part of the journey only.
4824,American Airlines needs to work on their sensitivity to breast feeding mom's. They insisted I check my carry on suitcase b/c I was carrying a breast pump. Even when I consolidated my bags to 2 items they would not let me board without checking my bags. Nice!! Oh to be a professional man and not have to worry about airlines trying to put obstacles in the way of feeding your baby even when you travel for work.
4825,SFO-NRT-SFO heard good reviews of ANA but was disappointed. The first meal (lunch) we got from SFO to NRT was typical Japanese meal which was good. They did not offer any snacks in between meals. Just water and tea. Second meal was chimichangas (the kind you get from Costco). I could not believe they would serve Mexican fast food in a Japanese airline! On the trip back NRT to SFO the first meal was good typical Japanese meal. The second meal (breakfast) was a hamburger which was awful. Again no snacks offered in between meals just tea and water. Service good and staff were friendly enough. I would not use this airline again.
4826,Toledo OH to Denver CO via one stop in Chicago (O'Hare) Trip to Denver had one delay of 3 hours at Chicago. May 7 2014 no reason given. Coming back snow storm in Denver delayed the plane takeoff by 1 hour not so bad. However when I got to Chicago the nightmare began. First flight to Toledo was delayed then cancelled. Reason who knows no 2nd pilot was the reason given. Got another flight time. Rain storm came. Two more flights delayed moved to different gate delayed then cancelled. What to do? No hotels taxi line 2 miles long. I left the boarding area so couldn't get back upstairs. Had to spend the night in a hard chair. Finally had to book a flight to Fort Wayne Indiana so I could get home. No flights to Toledo. What a nightmare experience!
4827,Chicago ORD to Boston. They got me to where I wanted to go at a reasonable time at a reasonable price. Can't blame American for the delay. I didn't expect free food or free alcohol. B737-800 was fine and so was the crew.
4828,Worst customer service I have had. My flight was cancelled today due to reasons that the airline had no control over but the customer service was awful. I was at O'Hare in Chicago flying to Phoenix and departing at 11.35. I left the airport today in Chicago feeling like I got stranded with no help and to fend for myself. I have never had a cancelled flight and didn't know what to do. I followed everyone else and waited to speak to an agent in line for almost 2 hours. When it was my turn to speak to someone they closed the line down and said we needed to go to the booking desk. I had no idea where that was and tried to ask. After being ignored one of the agents snapped at me and told me they couldn't help me unless I was flying to Dallas. They wouldn't even direct me on where I needed to go. I will never fly this airline again after I finally get home tomorrow. Worst customer service I have ever had to deal with.
4829,NRT-LHR return. Seat 23D which looks appealing due to being a mini cabin had substantially less leg room. Couldn't straighten my legs and was in pain when getting off the aircraft. Food was average for lunch and poor for the second meal with a disgusting hotdog on outbound and some dodgy sliced meat on return. Return was again delayed this time due to servicing issues at LHR. Left me with short time for connection at NRT. Guess what again delayed both on take off and then delayed for another 40 minutes. Cabin crew polite and friendly as normal for Japanese airline. Not great value for money considering there seems to be a premium for flying with a Japanese airline out of NRT when compared to other Asian airports.
4830,We paid about $2400 each for a nonstop Premium Economy ticket from IAD to NRT because the thought of cramped quarters in Economy for 14 hours to NRT and 12 hours back to IAD put us off. While I cannot complain about the quality and comfort of the seats - we had footrests seat width was spacious decent amount of pitch nice armrests so both you and the person next to you both had plenty of elbow room - the service was not that great. On the way to Narita we were served shortly after being airborne but it was 9.5 hours before we were offered any sort of food again. Sure the flight attendants would come by offering green tea or coffee but not even a lousy bag of pretzels? The same thing happened on the way back - fortunately we brought snacks with us so we were more prepared but it was still uncomfortable. If I'm paying twice the price of the economy ticket (which Premium was in this case) you would think we would have received at least a few more snacks than Economy. It was an uncomfortable experience. I doubt if we would fly ANA again because of it.
4831,"Flew May 13/14 2014 ONT-DAL-DTW. This was the worst flight experience I've had. The plane in ONT was delayed 5 hours due to maintenance causing nearly everyone to miss their connecting flight out of DAL. We had to wait in line (I waited 1.5 hours) at ONT to get on a new connecting flight out of DAL. The seats on the plane out of ONT were tiny old creaky and uncomfortable and staff were disinterested and unfriendly. There was no ""inflight entertainment"" to speak of. The worst came however when we arrived at DAL. Immediately upon disembarking we were informed that ""there are no hotel rooms left in Dallas"". The customer service reps feebly tried to console people with Nature Valley granola bars and cheaply-made cots but everyone was in a mostly miserable mood. I and many others ended up trying to sleep on chairs through the night. Very few people got any sleep. Terrible experience all around. The last time I fly American."
4832,Traveling from Miami to Santo Domingo arrived at the airport approximately 1.5 prior to departure. First you have to queue to help yourself at one of the self-service check in machine. After waiting for approximately 10 minutes we go through the check in procedure experienced some problem and had to get help from the staff member at the check in station. In the end we were unable to check in and were asked to go to the customer service counter. The staff member at the counter asks us to wait and disappears for 5 to 10 min and when he returns he advises us that we are now to late to check in luggage as it is less than an hour before departure and we are talking about 10 minutes now. He advises us that we can fly but our luggage cannot. Only option is to take a flight the next day pay $120 to change the flight and pay for another night in a hotel. The main issue here is the rude attitude of the staff. We can accept that there are rules to be followed but the attitude of the staff is a disgrace. AA have never been a great airline but this experience is by far the worst we have ever experience with any airline. We will do our very best to avoid flying AA again.
4833,NRT-SFO-NRT Business class on B777-300. Lounge in Narita excellent. Onboard service is a little lacking. No pre-take off drinks served on ANA unlike other business class offerings elsewhere. When leveled out still no drinks were offered just a complimentary 'Kool-Aid' type of plum drink given out. Had to wait until the dinner ordering to get a beer. Food was great however the breakfast offering into SFO was poor for business class - a couple of muffins and poor tasting coffee. Food on the return and all-daylight flight was much better. Seat great but being tall not as comfortable as Asiana's flat beds. Also the bulkhead in business class found me touching with my feet whilst trying to sleep - annoying. Didn't bother sleeping on the return flight. Given the Business Class fare was a good deal the service wasn't bad but sure wasn't anything to get excited about. ANA need to lift their game in my opinion. In my answer 3 below its a recommendation in regards to competing airlines on the route not against other airlines. ANA are the best of a fairly average lot to the USA from Japan.
4834,"LHR-DFW-XNA AA51 transatlantic then American Eagle. I had avoided American Airlines transatlantic for years but thought to give the ""new"" American a try. Boeing 777-300ER already showing wear and tear in First Class. Cabin was dirty and food was inedible. Also the logic of serving lunch/dinner on an 09.30 flight utterly defeats me. Why not serve lovely breakfast? Crew was keen to get meal service over and disappear for the remainder of the flight. Flight diverted to IAH due to low fuel / weather but almost no announcements from flight deck. On American Eagle flight attendant was rude and not professionally dressed; She wore a crumpled uniform and believe it or not Dutch-style clogs. Overall it is so sad that there is no sophistication nor manner / culture at the ""new"" American Airlines. Travel on American Airlines is nowhere close to a First Class experience. This is a desperately poor airline but there isn't much choice across the pond sadly. Avoid this carrier if you can."
4835,We took this airline from Raleigh to London because we expected a similar service to BA with which it codeshares. Unfortunately we were so wrong! There is firstly no modern inflight entertainment system for economy class and the food was dreadful. Onboard service was rushed and not very friendly and to top it all we had one of the flight attendants talking loudly with passengers at the back throughout the whole night. Of course that meant that even without entertainment there was also no sleeping for those of us unlucky enough to be in this attendant's vicinity.
4836,LHR to JFK thinking I was traveling on British Airways flight BA1506 only found out I was flying on a codeshare flight with American Airlines AA105 when I got to the airport. Check in was efficient and friendly and the flight was uneventful except for the crew who made the whole experience feel very uncomfortable. I have never experienced cabin crew like it. Its a given that everyone has an off day once and a while but some of the crews interactions with the passengers that I witnessed were uncalled for. Crew were short unfriendly disinterested and deliberately ignored some passengers. At one stage I was made to feel like a huge inconvenience when I asked for a paper towel to dry up some water I accidentally spilled. In the end I had to queue at the toilets as I was informed I was capable of getting my own towels as the crew were busy. When we landed and were disembarking the crew thanked me for flying the New American Airlines. I don't know why BA codeshare with this airline as the service standards are at complete opposites of the scale. When I book my next flight I will make sure I know what airline I'm flying so I'm not on a code share with AA.
4837,Worst airline I have flown with. American Airlines should be branded a budget airline. Flew from JFK to LHR and the experience was beyond belief. Firstly I was charged an arm and leg for excess weight off my bag. Secondly the staff on AA should get training serious training and customer service skills. The food is almost non existent seats are worst in class and the TV's are approx 4inch which are well scratched and used!
4838,"LHR-NRT-LHR round trip in economy. Every aspect of service excellent from check-in to disembarking. The cabin crew worked hard to meet passenger wishes and gave the impression that nothing was too much trouble. But the seating is dreadful. They were the most uncomfortable seats with the smallest pitch I can remember on a long-haul flight. My knees were firmly up against the seat in front and had I not been able to move to an empty exit row seat on each flight then the flights would have been unbearable. For this reason alone I would not fly with ANA again nor recommend them to anyone over 5'6"" tall."
4839,I just returned from a trip from Seattle WA to Punta Cana DR and back. I told my husband after the first plane that I would never fly American again. It was 3 planes there and 3 back. The seats were the most tiny and uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. I am 5 ft 2 and 115 lbs so by no means am I a big person. The staff were awful. I have never met people so disinterested and rude. When leaving Punta Cana we sat in line for 1.5 hours because there was no one there to check us in! Every other airline were getting people through. We made it to our flight in the nick of time. We got there at 4am and didn't get to the plane until 6.25 and it left at 6.50. They were almost done boarding. I do not recommend this airline.
4840,From Sacramento to Dallas 4 of us booked our trip in early January. Final destination Paris France. We tried to select seats but arrived to find our seats changed. None of us together and 1 was the very back where it was so very noisy the flight was miserable. In Dallas we switched planes (again operated by American Airlines) what was supposed to be a 2 hour layover became an 8 hour layover. The legroom was non existent and when the people in front of us tilted chairs back we could hardly move for 10 hours. miserable. I will not support American Airlines to Europe or even to Dallas. I am not sure if they have just gone downhill or what. I must commend the fellow passengers for their tolerance of such a crummy flight.
4841,DFW to MOB flight AA2981 and AA3377 MOB to DFW. On our round trip flight so far 2 of the 3 aircraft's have had maintenance issues resulting in delays missed connections and waiting on standby. We have yet to hear a single apology.
4842,CDG-ORD-BWI operated on a Boeing 767-300 and an Embraer 145. I have Gold status on AA so I was able to obtain a Main Cabin Extra seat on the first flight free of charge and an exit-row seat on the second flight. The ground experience at CDG was okay and they were pretty well organized. The first flight took off on-time although we had to board by bus (something that probably irritates every passenger). Cabin crew were okay and there was no IFE which I knew to expect even though practically every other carrier has it by now. The connection at ORD was amazingly painless and security was a breeze. The Eagle flight was delayed due to a late inbound aircraft but we landed a mere 30 minutes behind schedule and my checked bag was waiting for me on the carousel just 10 minutes or so after landing. All in all fairly satisfied.
4843,Tampa to Chicago O'Hare on 28 April. Check-in was fast but very unfriendly. Cabin crew were unfriendly and uninterested. Plane was cramped and service was almost non-existent. Only thing offered was soft-drinks. No hot drinks snacks or food available which is pretty poor for a what's scheduled as a 3 hour flight. No entertainment on offer the flight got me from A to B but that's about it. I've had better service on Ryanair. Not a great addition to the Oneworld Alliance.
4844,"I am currently sitting at LAX airport and having the worst experience I had with an airline. I arrived in LA this morning by Qantas from Perth-Sydney and upon going through the ""Express Connection"" I was informed by one of the ground crew members that I would be required to take my luggage and check-in inside the terminal. When I arrived in the terminal I was sent by American Airlines employees to 3 different places to try to drop-in my baggage. When I finally arrived in the last spot (45 min prior to flight schedule time) I was informed that I wouldn't be able to check-in my bags nor take them in the cabin despite having had checked-in on-line prior to going to the airport. She them put my wife and me in ""stand-by"" list for a flight 2 hours later and checked our bags-in. I was placed in second in the list at that moment (again according to the front desk lady because I am a ""One World Sapphire Member"" and would be put in front of other people in similar situations. In the half hour preceding the boarding time our name had escalated to 6th and 7th on the list. I tried to (very politely) speak with the lady at the boarding desk 3 times but she in each time she rudely answered ""Stand-by I will be with you in a second!"" In the end she suggested that one of us should take a remaining seat and the other wait for the next flight. We decided to do that as the next flight seat wouldn't be warrant as well. Everything was dealt in a rush/unplanned manner showing AA have no control to handle such situations. Now I am here hoping to not get bumped again or get stuck in LA for the night after 16 hrs flying from Australia then meet my wife at my destination and go to the hotel to have a rest. This was my first flight with AA and certainly the last one."
4845,SFO-NRT B777-200 return in economy class. Perfect service excellent food. very clean. Everything was perfect except seat pitch length very uncomfortable. Best service I've ever had but worst seat comfort I've ever had in this round trip.
4846,Antalya-Ankara direct flights of Turkish Airlines are operated by Anadolu Jet that is a trademark of Turkish Airlines. Anadolu Jet has no Business Class Service and you are obligated to a low profile service as long as you don't transfer through Istanbul. For the CIP Lounge you have to pay an additional fee that doesn't fit with Gold Card holders. No options is a severe pain.
4847,TK7087 16th Feb. Flew VAN to Ankara on 737. Flight delayed due to bad weather in VAN and because 2 passengers wanted to disembark after the final door was closed (which then meant everyone had to grab their hand luggage and the overhead bins had to be checked). The flight itself was pleasant with a small snack on the short flight. The crew were very friendly too.
4848,MEX-DFW-YUL Business Class. We were lucky enough to get a discounted fare so that Business Class was a bit cheaper than the economy class fares available. On the MEX-DFW leg plane was an old and a bit worn out MD80. Good flight with a really kind and helpful flight assistant who spoke a perfect Spanish. I don't fly AA often but I must admit that I've always found nice and smiling staff both in business and economy class. Good to know that if you have an international connection via DFW you no longer need to retrieve and recheck your baggage to your final destination. We went through immigration very fast and headed for the Admiral's Club which is really disappointing: no snacks except for cookies only 1 alcoholic drink per person unfriendly staff. On the bright side wifi was good and the view on the tarmac was excellent. The DFW-YUL leg was on a newer 737 and it was an uneventful flight with a good lunch but a very poor selection of drinks. Nice staff.
4849,I flew from San Francisco to Heathrow on April 26th and found the airline crew working in economy to be both unfriendly and unprofessional. The most senior of the crew had an abrupt manner I noticed on more than one occasion her behaviour towards passengers who accidentally happened to get in her way in the galley area there was no politeness shown in terms of politely asking them to move but eye rolling and heavy sighing. My pillow happened to fall into aisle without my knowledge and I was reprimanded by this senior crew member for allowing this to happen! The crew whilst serving beverages/food would not engage in any conversation or pleasantries with passengers instead they would look right through you if you smiled at them they would not smile back when I exited the economy area on leaving the plane a couple of the crew stood near the exit area and there was again no pleasantries or smiles just silence. Only on leaving the plane did a friendly crew member who I believe had been working in First Class or Business Class speak to me and said 'thanks for flying with us have a good day'. I have flown with many airlines and I have to say that my return flight home with AA was the worst experience I have ever known and because of this I will not be flying with AA again. AA show a video to their passengers before a flight which promotes the technology investments they have made in relation to improving the customer experience. I would recommend to AA that they focus more attention and investment into the training of their crew to provide a better service to their customers.
4850,"Flew MIA-BCN business class. I am a long user of AA but always inside the US or from Venezuela to US. This is the first time I took AA to Europe usually when going to Spain I use Iberia. I had very low expectations but must say I was impressed. This flight was on the o767 the cabin in business is the ""old business class"" with seats that do not lie flat but I must say that it was comfortable enough to take a 4 hour sleep. Amenities kit nice and pretty. No private screen but a Samsung tablet was provided not a huge a mount of options but it was more than Ok. The biggest surprise? Food was excellent and in amounts that I have never seen before in other Business class. Plenty of bubbly. Service extraordinary FA's smiling and helpful."
4851,Flight Antalya to Ankara flight on time pleasant air crew passenger given snacks and drinks unfortunately wanted tea but the crew did not have any milk which was disappointing as I have used Pegasus and they always have milk for tea.
4852,LGA-PBI April 19th 2014 was overall great. Flight was on time and we even landed early. The crew of flight attendants and pilots were nothing great flight attendants didn't give much personal attention to the passengers it seemed. We were seated in Main Cabin Extra in the front row (8A8B8C). Main Cabin Extra is supposed to have 6 inches of extra legroom since we were seated in the front with the bulkhead in front of us which is really just a wall for those of you who don't know it did not feel like we had 6 inches of legroom and it felt very cramped through the whole area. If you are about to pay extra money for main cabin extra avoid the first rows which is row 8. I'm not sure about 8D 8E 8F but I assume it's the same. Also the tray tables are considerably smaller because they are stowed in the arm rest. But they are kind of cool to an airline enthusiast like myself because it feels like a first class seat. We did not have to pay for Main Cabin Extra because my family had Gold member free Main Cabin Extra so for us it didn't matter but if you have to pay for MCE I would sit any row behind 8. All in all great flight and I love American they will always be my #1 airline to fly and I would still recommend flying them just not in row 8 MCE.
4853,My recent trip with American Airlines has made me become a United loyalist. I have sworn to myself to never fly American again. The horror started at the check-in at JFK. You'd think if there was a merger between American and US Airways that passengers could check in anywhere. No the quite literally 60 open and manned desks were for US Airways passengers only while the AA passengers had to get in line somewhere off to the side where there were two people working. On the plane a stewardess was sitting on the jump seat in the exit row and could not stop talking to a passenger in a very loud voice. Returning from LA the check-in procedure was hands down the most inefficient system I've seen in my life. Once boarded we had a plane from I don't know when but practically no one's baggage fit in the overhead compartment everyone had to check their bags and the whole thing delayed us by about thirty minutes. The stewardess must have elbowed me in the head at least a dozen times and woke me up once to ask if I'd like to drink something. No thank I was fine just sleeping. Never flying American again.
4854,Dallas to London in Business. The new AA cabin looks very good - spacious flat bed seats lots of storage and a big screen. However it was let down by slow service food that was simply not up to standard and the IFE froze and was not reset. AA has got the basics right but needs to work on the details.
4855,If you have to fly with someone don't fly with AA. They made me check in my carry on luggage and were unable to open the undercarriage door making me miss my connector flight to Atlanta. I had to stay overnight in Chicago due to their failure. I asked two different employees for a Supervisor and both of them told me there wasn't one. I had to go to a different airline and they got me an AA supervisor. The own AA employees outright lied to me about a supervisor. They scheduled me on a 6am flight the next morning and yet again they had issues. They had defuelling issues on the plane and everyone had to deboard. They are now trying to get us on a different plane. Do not fly with this company unless you want to pay a lot of money for a ticket to arrive a day later and potentially lose your luggage. Worst airline I've ever used so far.
4856,Mediocre service. Just flew from John Wayne to DFW and the flight was freezing. I asked for a blanket and was told they don't have any only to see unopened blankets on every seat in first class. I guess only first class passengers are worthy of being comfort. That really irritated me after freezing for two hours to see that they could have very easily provided a blanket. Really poor customer service. To actually say they don't have blankets when they do and you then see them.
4857,Nothing wrong with the service or the food but on some routes such as Barcelona to New York the planes are old and do not have individual entertainment systems. This means you have to watch whatever film is being shown on the overhead monitors making for a very long trip. There is a huge amount of competition out there so unless AA/US Air get new planes I will not be flying with them again.
4858,JFK-MIA-BOG round trip early-April 2014 in economy. American Airlines staff are consistently rude and grumpy. I am constantly surprised when once in a while there is a ground staff or cabin crew member who are actually polite and helpful.
4859,"American Airlines gave away our 3 first class seats on Flight 53 from MIA to DFW on Sunday April 13 despite the fact that we were at the gate 17 minutes before flight time. The agent had already left the with the standby passengers. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to AMA and to have to overnight at DFW. Also one of our party had to fly coach even though we purchased a first class seat. I used to worry that with the merger AA 's customer service would sink to U.S. Airs level. Now I'm afraid the ""new American Airlines"" will sink to an even lower level. They sent our luggage on to our final destination. I have lifetime Platinum status on AA for having flown over 2.2 million miles with them."
4860,"13 April 2014. AA1119 from Boston to Chicago ORD. AA1159 from Chicago to St Louis. There was a major delay due to the weather. So I checked with the crew at gate B30 before I board in Boston. She said AA1159 would also be delayed so it's ok. While I was checking my flight connection the other crew used the microphone and told everyone ""If you are woried about your connection don't be."" When we landed in Chicago I checked the gate for AA1159 via my phone status ""In Flight"". The gate was H11B so I went to the crew at H11A see what can they do for me. Since there were no more flights to St Louis they can only schedule me for the first flight the next morning. I asked where I could stay for the night told me I could stay at the gate or she could offer me a hotel for reduce rate. I decided to stay at the gate."
4861,Flight from LA to JAX via Miami was uneventful. Flight from JAX to Dallas was a total different story! Our flight left Florida at 7.20 am. After an hour in the air the captain announced we had to land urgently in Birmingham Alabama. Around 10 am they told us the mechanic was on the way and would take one more hour! By noon they announced there would be a plane coming from Dallas and should be in Birmingham by noon. We would be on our way and arrive at Dallas by 2.30 pm. I called an agent and was told there was only flight available leaving Dallas at 8.30 pm and arriving at LAX at 10.40 pm. We continued to wait and wondered what happened to the plane. The plane arrived in Birmingham at 3.00 pm. We were boarded by 3.20 pm. We were not moving for another two hours. Finally arrived to Dallas after 7 pm. Most of us had missed connecting flights and were told there would be an agent waiting for us at the gate to rebook our flights. There was no one waiting at the gate. I finally got on the next flight out of Dallas and felt lucky to be able to get on the 8.10 flight to arrive in LA at 9.40 pm. Arrived at LAX at 9.30 pm and told there was no gate available for another 20-30 min. We waited on the plane for 1 hr 40 min. I probably will not fly AA again.
4862,4/13/14. Flew from Rochester NY to Chicago. Plane was 45 minutes late due to weather taxiing from far reaches of O'Hare then no crew at taxiway. Missed our connection to Seattle. All flights overbooked so could not get on via standby had to stay overnight and pay for a hotel. Told our first class tickets through Travelocity were really Economy with instant upgrade we ultimately went coach 20 or so hours late. Never again. They did give us two $300 vouchers good for future travel within a year.
4863,We flew Heathrow to Puerto Rico 2 adults and 3 children under 12. When we tried to check-in online there were only 5 paid seats together - the others were scattered around the plane. Clearly we couldn't sit the 3 children on their own so we contacted AA and were told we'd have to pay the extra (Â£220) and book the paid seats which we did very reluctantly. When we checked in at the desk however we were told we couldn't have the seats we'd booked and were given 5 others which were a 2 and a 3. During the second leg of the trip we were given exit seats which were not allowed for children as we were told they would be 'a good bargaining tool' for swaps. On the return we couldn't sit at all near each other: 3 of us sat on the very back row and 2 at the front of the plane. However AA used BA as a carrier for the final leg - they had automatically allocated five seats together because we were travelling with children and allowed us onto the plane first - a completely different attitude from AA. I agree with former reviews - the seatbelt signs hardly went off on the AA flights which is unacceptable on long-haul. I have claimed a refund for the booked seats which we didn't get - am waiting to see if I'll actually get the money back.
4864,When we used to be able to fly through Chicago O'hare AA wasn't as bad. The last 12 times we've gone through DFW the plane sits on the runway after arrival for 30 minutes every time. This makes even an average time between connections tight. Then we get to our gate and the gate has changed while we're on the skytrain. And too often the flight is cancelled for no known reason. AA changes my seat unbeknown to me until check in which irks me. I do not care for the new 737s. All seats are 3+3 so there are no good rows and already tray tables are broken lights don't work and I don't think they fix them often. My husband is a 'top' platinum so he doesn't have some of the problems I do but he's not pleased anymore either.
4865,"Have lived outside the US for 20+ years. Have flown many long haul flights to European hubs and then on to different cities in the US. We usually fly on British Airways (great airline) or KLM or Delta. For the first time was forced (because of a change in flight schedules) to fly on American Airlines from DFW to London (Heathrow) yesterday. So many things wrong: seatbelt sign on for most of the flight despite only occasional mild turbulence. Not acceptable on a 9 hour flight. The flight attendants were not friendly or service oriented. They mostly communicated with each other and acted annoyed when interacting with passengers. or they just sat in the galley. On this long flight a request for another small bottle of water (in business class) was denied: ""Only one per customer"". They did not come around even once during the night to offer drinks. Unless there is no other choice avoid long-haul trips on this airline. The ground staff were a little better still not customer oriented."
4866,My husband and I have been trying to get home since 4/6/2014 we were booked on a flight at 4.10 after a one hour delay they cancelled it. We couldn't get booked on another flight so we had to stay over. They booked us on flight #2575 at 9.25 then overnight somehow we got cancelled even though we had recheck boarding passes. We were re- booked for a noon flight #2419. Then after being directed to 2 different gates and waiting in the airport for over 12 hours today 4/7/2014 our flights to Albuquerque were canceled. We were sent to 5 different gates during the 12 hours. 3 cancellations in 24 hours it's unacceptable customer service. We still don't know if we're actually going to have a plane at 8.20 flight #1285.
4867,"London to Lagos - most of the inflight entertainment was not working. Made the journey very boring. The food was too salty and again most of the inflight entertainment were not working. 5th July 2015 my return journey back to London with Arik Air, the flight was delayed. Our flight was meant to depart Lagos at 12pm only to be told at 12:33 that the plane was been re-refuelled. After blankets were handed out, we were expecting the headsets to be handed out. Only to be told, due to a technical glitch, there would be no in-flight entertainment at all. The plane was also very dirty. Unbelievable in this time and age. I also noticed that their food portion is getting smaller."
4868,My husband and I were on flight 2224 from Las Vegas on April 4. The airplane was an S-80. We flew first class and were very disappointed. The only difference between first and the rest of the plane was a wider seat and meal. The plane didn't have movies or music. Bare bones plane for sure. Also a constant stream of people walking from the back of the plane to use front lavatory. Also alcohol is plentiful if you drink however I wanted ice tea and that is not an option. Maybe they don't know that it is available in bottles or cans.
4869,Flew LHR-MIA. Seats are uncomfortable Inflight entertainment is below par. Overall its better just to avoid AA by all means.
4870,"I mostly travel with Arik Air and was never impressed. The flight from Lagos-London on 20/03/2015 was different as the inflight service was satisfactory but I noticed that the cabin crew were mostly foreigners and had a ""HiFly"" tag on. Arik should keep this standard and improve on it. The inflight entertainment was a sweet and bitter situation as some worked and some did not."
4871,We flew in from Jamaica to Dallas Fort Worth Texas and our flight was delayed. The biggest problem was that there was little information given to passengers. After 2 hours we found out we were waiting for a crew to arrive from another destination. After being delayed 4 hours we finally got on the plane to sit on the runway for another 45 minutes. The pilot said we were being re-routed due to weather and did not have enough fuel and would have to go back to the gate to refuel. We reach the gate at 2am and wait to only be told the flight was now cancelled. This is where I truly get frustrated with the way things were handled. 150+ passengers are told their flight is cancelled but there is no other flights going into Louisville. You will have to find another way home or wait until Wednesday (6 days later)! We wait in line another 1.5 hrs to try and find a flight close to home willing to drive the rest of the way. The gate agents have been no help whatsoever it was 5.30 in the morning and they offered no cots or anything to us. There were no hotel rooms. They did give us a $12 voucher for a meal. Finally got a late flight almost 24 hours later to Cincinnati but now have to incur additional expense of renting a car to get home. Tried to get on a couple of standby flights but I have noticed that AA overbooked every flight and boots people off so stand by is a joke. Highly disappointed!
4872,Paid $1700 for two seats. Airline website would not allow us to choose seats at time of booking. Return a week later to book and lo and behold only paid seats left. Call Airline and told unless we pay and additional $170 per person we will have to depend on the kindness of others to move seats so we can sit together. This is absolute crap. If you can't book your seats at time of booking then don't buy the ticket unless you're willing to pay additional $$$ to actually get a seat.
4873,We flew from MCO via MIA to Punta Cana. The first leg was fine and for an hours flight every was completely satisfying. The second leg from Miami to Punta Cana was a total disappointment for my first international flight with AA. At the airport I was rejected to enter the lounge as for flights to The Caribbean the access is excluded. This logic I will never understand. The two flight attendants have been absolutely passive in their service and spent their time rather with making jokes with each other or actively ignoring requests such as a glass of water or getting visa documents. One flight attendant had his hands in his pockets at all times - while going through the aisle. I have never been so disappointed from a Business Class flight before. For sure AA will not have me as a customer onboard again and I am glad that there are a lot of options on the US flight market.
4874,Flight from JFK to MMA. The check in staff were helpful and polite and we thought flying Arik would be a pleasant experience regardless of the bad reviews alas this was not the case. The security briefing was uninspiring to say the least an airline of Ariks size should really use a video people had to move their heads and practically get out of their seats to see what the crew member was doing and the person with the script had trouble with reading it. The inflight entertainment system didn't work and the staff didn't seem to care they were not apologetic or surprised it made me wonder when last it had worked. The staff were very unprofessional not courtesy in the way the addressed customers they didn't offer any extra drinks or snacks for the duration of the flight until they served breakfast. The food was unappealing and small in size. Overall Arik was a great disappointment and I will never fly them long haul again.
4875,No airs or graces about Arik Air. My last trip from Lagos to Johannesburg was very bad firstly all passengers were waiting at the departure gate when a ground staff announced a delay because the flight staff i.e pilot and the crew were not at the airport yet. When they eventually arrived they asked us to give them some time to carry out their checks. Once onboard the customer service received was very poor. No headset provided for the entertainment system when I asked for the headset I was told they had none. Staff were very blasÃ© about the whole situation no apology or even acknowledgement of the problems. On the return trip again the entertainment system was not working and no running water in the toilets. This is my 1st and last trip with Arik Air.
4876,"2 days ago I was in Lagos. There was already an 8 hour layover before I boarded this plane to JFK our boarding passes said we were to board at 9.30 pm and depart at 11.30 pm. 9.30 passed 10.30 passed. No updates as to why we were all sitting there not being attended to. A few minutes past 11 a female employee comes and tells a few people that our plane was indeed ""faulty"". Then she proceeds to say the next flight was not leaving until 10.30pm the following night. Some time went by and a male employee comes and gives us several different messages while on the phone being followed around by passengers he tells us the next flight will leave by 1.30 am long story short our original departure date of 11.30 pm turned out to actually be after 3 am. Bad customer service on the flight not organized in the airport - overall just a bad experience. I will not recommend Arik Air."
4877,I recently flew business class from London to Lagos and then on to Asaba. I hadn't previously heard of Arik usually preferring BA. However the Arik price was more than half the BA price and also had the guaranteed connections from Lagos. The business class product is impressive - the beds are better than BA and the cabin feels a lot more spacious (including a bar where you can go to sit). The cabin crew were also very friendly. The internal flights were both delayed because of the weather - this was dealt with well by the Arik staff. Though the inflight entertainment is not too good and the customer service is not quite up to the BA / Virgin standard I was still impressed with Arik and would certainly fly with them again.
4878,"I arrived 4 hours early for my late afternoon flight to Orlando after my cruise. I was confirmed in Main Cabin Extra. Miami has always been a ""challenging"" airport but not having been there in over a decade it was a whole new challenge. My bag was 5 lbs overweight so I had to go buy a small personal carry item and remove 5 lbs from my bag. Needless to say a huge hassle. Since I checked in so early American did not offer to put me on one of the several flight before mine but they certainly did send my bag early as it was already in this huge mire when I arrived in Orlando. The security situation in Miami is a nightmare. Once finally through the drama the new terminal AA built was nice with allot more choices of things to do but it seemed gate after gate I passed no one cleaned up the trash left by the customers. Flight boarded on time I asked for some tissue got it promptly then only saw the Flight attendants during seat belt check before and take off and landing. They all seemed to pile into F class and offer multiple drink rounds. Main Cabin Extra is what AA Coach used to be minus the service. We arrived on time and my bag had been waiting hours for me. No complaints."
4879,I hadn't flown American since the mid-80s when the service varied between passive-aggressive and actively unpleasant. Things have improved since then. The service on two flights - business from Miami to San Jose and economy from Panama City to Miami - was fine and even friendly. But the entertainment food etc show less sign of change.
4880,I waited in Port Harcourt airport for 10 hrs for a flight and we were never told a thing by Arik reps. The same I fly very frequently and I have not seen a worse airline. First you can't track the flights which wouldn't be so bad if there were any employees or a desk to find out what is going on but there isn't. In our case the flight was delayed 11 hrs. When we all showed up at the gate 11 hrs later our plane was no where to be seen and we waited with no information for another 2 hours. On our flight from NY to Lagos the planes air system was not switched on until we left the gate. The crew at least in my section did a good job to take care of us. On our flight from Lagos which was finally located and some crew from the airport loaded us on the plane there was no water soap or paper in the bathrooms. Half of the food was missing. On my return flight when I got to the airport I was told the connecting flight I was booked on does not even connect with the flight to NY in Lagos and doesn't leave for another 5 hours and that I could try again 2 days later but the same thing would probably happen. So they booked a flight connection that doesn't exist! I spent $1900 on a new flight out of SL on Brussels.
4881,I waited in Port Harcourt airport for 10 hrs for a flight and we were never told a thing by Arik reps. The same story for the time the plane was arriving and when it did arrive my Emirates flight had departed Lagos at 2130. I made it to Lagos at 1130 and had to change my flight and get a hotel. A poor excuse for an airline and customer relations is even worse. I came back into Lagos and got delayed by 3 hrs again coming to Port Harcourt.
4882,Return flight from Lagos Nigeria to London 13th July 2013. Departure was 3pm but didn't take off until 7pm. No information or explanation provided. Things got unbearable. Eventually staff advised the delay was due to lack of aviation fuel. This only angered passengers even more as it was clear this was a lie and has now become the airline's only excuse for delayed flights! Destination was meant to be London Heathrow but was informed just 20 mins to landing that it would be Gatwick. At this point there was no holding back the passengers (most of which had young children) and most refused to come down from the plane until provisions were made to get all to Heathrow.
4883,I was traveling home from Palm Springs CA. through Dallas. Flight was delayed 3 times through e-mail notification before any gate agent was seen. When I asked the young lady about our flight she didn't know anything. After a couple of calls she made an announcement. All I wanted was some info so I knew what to do next. After boarding and taxiing to the runway we were told we did not have enough fuel to make it around the approaching storm. Then the flight was canceled and re-instated in about 15 minutes. After we did land 6 hours late in Shreveport I called customer relations and they were not helpful at all. I was offered $200 toward my next travel.
4884,July 3 2013. New York City to Lagos. When we landed in Lagos we were told to fill out an Immigration form only to find out that we didn't need to fill out the form because we were transiting. Then told to go and get our suitcases. Waited 2.5 hrs only to be told that our suitcase had already been put on another plane. July 24 2013. In Accra Ghana told there was a delay on our flight to Lagos. Flight supposed to leave at 5.45pm flight did not leave until 8.30pm. When we got to Lagos we sat in the airport for 6 hours with no explanation as to why we were still in the airport. Told that once again the plane did not have fuel. Finally allowed to board. Flight attendants rude and had a nasty attitude.
4885,New York-Lagos-Accra return. The cabin crew was excellent. The Arik staff at Lagos airport were not the nicest people and they demanded money for everything. From Accra my group and I checked in as a group without any problems but because the folks in Nigeria wanted more Kobos and Nairas. In any case this will be my last flight on Arik unless major changes are made.
4886,Disappointment! This is my second time flying with Arik and service seems to have got worse. When I first travelled with Arik from NY to Lagos the television did not work on my flight there was a very nasty flight attendant and when returning from Lagos to NY the televisions did not work again so I was stuck on an 11 hour flight with children that cried most of the flight. Attendants were much more pleasant. Now my flight has been delayed for the third time tonight by Arik without any explanations! No one seems to care about customers. I wish them the best and hope they improve but as for me this will be my last time flying with them!
4887,23 March. JAX to DFW to connect with a BA flight back to LHR (comment later). Aircraft MD83. I took this flight with very low expectations following past experience and general comments. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. Check-in at JAX was swift friendly and cruised past security in no time; was offered Fast Track and then again JAX is not the busiest of airports in the US. Unfortunately there are no lounges for premium passengers unless you are flying DL or their Skyteam partners. Boarding was relatively ordered. Was greeted with a smile (first impression counts) and shown to my seat by the friendly stewardess. Unlike many European carriers on their shorthaul aircraft's the premium cabins in this case do have distinct seating in their different classes. For the type of aircraft and duration of flight I would say it was quite appropriate - no use expecting a flatbed or deluxe booth for a two hour + flight. Once boarding was complete announcements were made hot towels offered followed by a choice of bubbly juice or water. Lift off was on time and flight pretty smooth most of the time. A few bumps here and there but that's part of flying. Service was above my expectations the stewardess was extremely friendly helpful and fully justified the premium escence of the cabin. Main and only disappointment was the food. Not bad but certainly not a First Class offering. On shorter Asian and European journeys the offering is far superior in a comparable cabin. On the other hand being a nut-allergy sufferer the pre-lunch aperitif of warm nuts was a no-go for me however this charming lady went out of her way to get me an appropriate (and definitely yummier) substitute - corn chips with a houmous dip. Landing was a bit later than scheduled but beforehand I was explained the best way of getting to my connecting flight. Surprisingly and with a mere 40 minutes to spare my bag even made it to my connection. Well done American!
4888,Only drinks were offered on flight. Not even a bag of peanuts. The man beside us tried to buy food but said they were basically out and we were only a few rows behind business class. Flying from Toronto and connecting in Miami. Lost our luggage on our connection to Costa Rica. Had to wait 2 hours in Costa Rica airport for lost luggage and said would have it later that night delivered to hotel. Wasn't there the next day and had no idea where it was. No one would pick up the phone at the airport. Finally got it the following morning when we were at another hotel 4 hours away. First and last time.
4889,Everything was fine except they did not offer any food in Economy class (you have to pay for some poor snacks). Our flight was at lunchtime. The ticket fare was $500 you'd think they would manage to fit a sandwich or slice of pizza in the budget. The Business Class passengers were served snacks hot meals and free alcoholic drinks. Outrageous.
4890,Leg room on A340 gives a generous pitch and baggage allowance is a generous 30 kilos. Inflight entertainment was very poor. They didn't provide headphones I was told the IFE did not work in some seats. Eventually I was given headphones and told to try my luck quality was very poor. The food was very bland- and the portions small. I was within the first 20 and told the beef had run out. Crew were polite enough but I didn't get the impression of being greatly experienced. Fly Arik if you want a comfortable seat and have a lot of luggage if inflight entertainment food and service is important to you stay well clear.
4891,Flight from RTB to FRA via MIA. Flight departed in Roatan 1hr delayed. After the immigration we missed our connection flight. So we had to rebook for the next day. Finding the airport shuttle to the hotel was very hard without any guidance. Rebooked flight to FRA via DFW was delayed for another hour so we thought it could get close again. So we asked for the gate for our connection flight. After reaching the gate we were told that this is the wrong gate and the flight is delayed or another three hours. All ground staff were rude and not willing to get us asap to FRA. The Entertainment system is not state of the art and sometimes not working. The crew were unfriendly. Food is a joke. Never again with AA.
4892,"Flew to Nigeria on Arik return. My flights were most disappointing in Premier Class (Business Class). The meals were not particularly appetizing. There a long stretch of time between the first meal and the last the attendants refused to provide snacks to passengers who asked. They gladly offered alcoholic beverages but refused snacks. The entertainment system in the premier compartment (for a 13 hour flight) was not working. Given the cost of the flight the overall poor service this experience lead me to the decision to stop flying Arik Air. On arrival at both destinations my luggage which was tagged with ""Priority"" labels but were among the last pieces off luggage to exit the plane."
4893,We have flown Martinair 3 times to Orlando. We have chosen Martinair because they are cheap and are the only one flying non-stop to Orlando. However it's a pity that you have to pay for personal entertainment in Economy whereas in the Comfort Class it's free. Further more the cabin crew on these flights were very helpful.
4894,My husband and I travelled from San Juan to Miami and to Seattle. Nothing was offered in the form of snacks so forget about food. Such a long ride and the seats were very uncomfortable. We had to pay $25.00 for the checked bag. I don't understand how the airlines are getting so cheap. I looked online before I left and it said there would not be any charge for the checked bag. From Seattle to Atlanta and then to San Juan I travelled on the Delta Airlines and we were given snacks.
4895,MAN to JFK on British Airways ticket but American Airlines aircraft. Very old B757 aircraft that has not been refurbished. No seat back screens. Only two choices of meal (three on virgin Atlantic). Very average quality and small portion size. Dessert consisted of a couple of biscuits. Crew were pretty good. No complaints and flight was on time. Seating was cramped. Large number of seats converted to extra legroom but for a premium price.
4896,I have flown Arikair (both long & short haul) a few times now and got mixed experiences. The not so good experience was with the ground staff at Lagos in May 2010 when I was harassed & dispossessed of expensive perfume bottles (50mls each) with contents even less. I wrote a letter of complaint but never got a reply. Generally the services are fair but lack of online checking and ineffective communication has let it down. I can also observe that the aircrafts are flown 1/2 or less full most of the time and wonder why prices are still up.
4897,Arik Air seem to have no idea of what customer service means and how their scheduling problems adversely affect the lives of their passengers. Arik Air schedule a return flight from Accra to Lagos for 1745. the flight almost never leaves Accra before 2100 (Accra Time) which means that you arrive in Lagos at 2330 at the earliest (there are instances of the passengers finding themselves going home from the airport at 2am (Lagos time). So a journey that is supposed to be a 45min flight now becomes 6 hours with no consideration of customer comfort from the airline. On the evening flight from Lagos to Accra I have experienced similar delays (with no information coming from the Arik ground Staff) for almost 3hours. I had to call the Arik Reservations line to get information repeatedly. In Accra no information is given on the delay no provision is made from refreshments or for the comfort of Arik passengers and on top of that you get treated like a nuisance because you have to ask repeatedly on the status of the flight as no information is given either over the information system or by Arik Ground staff.
4898,Flight #1361 BNA-LAX on 3/14/2014. 1st class AM flight and was offered Corn Flakes or Oatmeal? Isn't this 1st class. In this day and age I cannot believe this is the offering. Where is the fruit yoghurt or hot breakfast sandwich? Coach was offered nothing. Nothing to purchase not even a miniature snack of nuts. This was a 5 hour flight. I expect that length of flight to at the very minimum offer a meal that is available to purchase.
4899,Flew on an award economy ticket RDU-LHR-RDU a very convenient route if you live in NC/SC or Southern VA. Both flights on time the food edible the service efficient if not enthusiastic the seats cramped and uncomfortable. AA deploys a 767-300 on this route a fine 20th century workhorse but woefully inadequate for the 21st century in passenger comfort and technology - only cabin ceiling monitors for in flight entertainment. The new AA/US combination will need to work hard in the future to match their partner BA and the others competing with them offering US to Europe non stops.
4900,LHR-JFK on my way to Rio and I found that the crew were very unpleasant and had a couldn't care attitude. The connecting flight to Rio was cancelled due to technical issues and a hotel was organised but we had a terrible time getting to he hotel as there was no one to guide or direct us. Very unpleasant experience both ways and the food was a joke too - serving a pizza for breakfast! It was take it or leave it as they had no other options. The crew looked so fed up to be there. I am doing the same journey again but this time definitely it will be a different airline.
4901,Dakar to Freetown return the flight was okay but the airline purposefully cheated us on purchasing the ticket in Dakar - and the return flight from Freetown was late in arriving spent more time than necessary on a stop-over in Banjul. Bottom line the service was marginally acceptable plane was modern - but they seem to be scam artists when it comes to ticketing. I would not fly Arik unless there is no other alternative.
4902,"Stewardesses were extremely rude on every flight. I had 2 connections from Jacksonville FL to Long Beach CA and then 3 connecting flights on the return home. My carry on was well within the measurement requirements and every time it fit nicely under the seat in front of me. The bag carried my pillow so it appeared to be full. Upon boarding every flight I was harshly informed that ""it will not fit and would need to be checked."" One lady even tried to take it from me. I had to unnecessarily prove on every flight that it did indeed fit under the seat in front of me. After seeing for her own eyes one stewardess rolled her eyes and walked away. The beverage service was less than mediocre. Not one staff member appeared to be happy to be there."
4903,I took AA4244 from DCA to ORD on 3/17/2014. Flight arrived on time but there was no space for the flight to park due to the only one bridge being broken. After waiting 45 mins flight finally got a free bridge. Several people missed the connection. AA could arrange the flight to wait for few mins as they already knew the flight was waiting outside for the bridge but they prefer to give us hotel and meal voucher. This has happened several times on my trip. If I could I would not take such an airline again. Very disappointed.
4904,I flew from Schiphol to Jamaica with ArkeFly. The aircraft was old dirty and noisy. There was minimal legroom which can make a long haul flight very uncomfortable. But the worst part was the flight attendants never have I ever met so many rude flight attendants during one flight. As a passenger you are expected to feel very sorry that you came to disturb the flight attendants during their flight. If you ask for pillow or blanket all you get back is very rude words and eye-rolling you don't feel like a paying customer at all. Also the flight attendants didn't speak English even when I told them that I don't understand Dutch. Unfortunately I cannot recommend ArkeFly to anyone.
4905,Lagos to JFK Business Class. New A340 the seat was lay flat and fairly spacious. Cabin almost empty while Economy was full. Even so the crew had trouble remembering to bring my food and never got around to headphones. The food they remembered to bring was fair to good. In seat power made up for thin AVOD so one could watch computer movie. Seat controls a bit contrived but functional. Arik was only airline in Lagos to take a credit card even though the purchase process was painful. Check in very confused but that seems to be the Lagos airport staff. Still a better experience than the US airlines international service.
4906,Have flown several times between Lagos domestic (Old terminal) and Warri. Flights on time and flight attendants attentive and friendly. Be warned that you'll have to hunt down your gate at Lagos if you want to be sure of catching your flight. It's not unusual for staff to just wander off for no announcements to be made and for passengers to be running across the runway at the last minute with their baggage in hand. On one occasion a Dutch wetlease service was used from Warri to Lagos older but it was a comfortable plane with one Dutch and one Nigerian FA both friendly and professional. The safety briefing was even done a second time as one passenger point blank refused to pay attention the first time and wouldn't remove their earphones. Food onboard constituted a carton of five alive juice and either a pain au chocolate or the standard Nigerian mystery meat pasty. Good luck with that one. Security at Warri as corrupt as anywhere else in Nigeria. Despite the airport being funded by Shell don't expect any special attention if you work for them though here they are particularly aggressive rather than the usual passive begging.
4907,Heathrow - Lagos and Lagos - Banjul. Very positive experience on every flight - both in economy and business (premier) class. LHR-LOS service excellent new aircraft flat beds in premier class - fares are more reasonable than BA and Virgin Atlantic. The issue is with their booking arrangements - you can make a reservation option online but then have to telephone to confirm and pay for the flight by phoning their London office (in my case). Also a lot of UK travel agents have difficulty booking Arik Air flights.
4908,Flown with them severally especially on the ABV-CBQ ABV-ENU ABV-BNI and occasional ABV-LOS route and there is still a lot to be done with regards to their customer service. Their ticketing and reservations (you can't purchase online unlike VK and AJ) systems leave a lot to be desired. Its usually chaotic at the purchase points and the ground staff are more concerned with barking orders at intending passengers. The inflight service is a continuation of what obtains on ground. Its a real shame for an airline that has such competent pilots and excellent equipment. They have to improve their act because in Nigeria they are becoming a byword for poor customer service and that has started affecting passenger loads. I only fly them because they offer direct flights to my major areas of operation.
4909,I would just like to echo the views of A Forrest (Mar 17th). My wife and I have returned from a long weekend in the big apple so endured MAN-JFK return flights over the last few days. The most antiquated substandard long haul flight that I have taken for a long time! I'm not saying that I will never fly AA again but if there is a choice then AA will not be my first!
4910,3 flights with 3 problems in less than a month. First bad weather cancels flight which can hardly be blamed on the airline. Not being able to even reach an agent to rebook for 48 hours and being forced to use an alternate airline to make meeting. Most definitely can. Second sat on tarmac for an hour waiting quite literally for a piece of paper certifying weight and then being forced to return to gate and refuel when minimum safe fuel line is broken was not fun. Having to literally run to connecting flight is even less fun. Especially when a comfortable wait was programmed into original flight. Third went to check in for overseas flight booked by government and after standing in line (no military bypass in system for check in) was unapologetically and without assistance punted to partner airline to stand in line for another hour. Because people who ticket with AA are just supposed to know this - particularly when standard check in procedures block military travel and leaves you stranded. Do the airlines really think making people wait needlessly and unapologetically is a good thing?
4911,"Manchester-JFK. Cannot believe there were no monitors in the back of the headrests instead monitors on the ceilings so far away you could barely see. The so called inflight entertainment (1 film for a 8.5 hour flight) broke after 10 minutes of starting and was off for an hour then anyway. When the ""food"" turned up I was given some cold pasta as there was no chicken left so it was this slop or nothing it was inedible so left it. On the way home there was a 2 hour delay and a gate change from 1 to 35. This time I got chicken but service was done in the dark and again only one film for a transatlantic flight so no distractions there or back which meant plenty of clock watching. This was my first time with American airlines and I can honestly say its the most prehistoric long haul flight I've ever had the misfortune to get on."
4912,OR365 27/2/14. OR366 13/3/14. We flew from Amsterdam to Bonaire in March 2014. The flight itself was ok but for the price we paid we expected better food and drink than we received. For the 10 hour overnight return flight we waited 2 hours for a small dinner (without drinks service in between) including one tea/coffee/juice. That was it! The only other drinks service was in the morning (2 hours before landing while most people were still asleep) where we had to pay for tea or coffee! We also had to pay extra for the Entertainment system which had a very poor selection.
4913,I flew from IAH to ORD my next flight was at 9.30 but I couldn't get off the plane because we had no space for the aircraft I told the flight attendant to let them know that I was running late. She didn't care so ended up missing my flight. Poor service poor attitude poor everything!
4914,"AA51 on two occasions. 6th Jan and 9th March 2014. As a seasoned traveller countless delays and negative experiences I still go about it with a smile. The negative experiences that I have I often just take with a smile. Not so this time. American Airlines provoked me so much on my last flights with them. I travel often in both economy and business as a paying customer. This time I was in business class with ""The New"" American and their 777-300ER. The product is great so is the food and the IFE. But the crew of AA are a disgrace. From the moment I stepped on the airplane an aura of unwelcomeness was hanging in the air. The crew were stressed and did not have time for anything but to run. No smiles nothing mostly just grumpy faces. After a dinner service that took forever to get going and that was served with a slap in the face I went to their famous buffÃ¨t of snacks to have some water and some fruit. As I did that one of the two flight attendants sitting there asked me: ""Didn't you eat already?"" I stood there feeling unwelcome. I don't pay a business class ticket to be met by such an attitude. It is simply incredible how unwelcome AA crews can make you feel on their long-haul flights. I'd much rather have bad food and IFE but a smiling friendly and service minded crew."
4915,I booked travel 2 months ago for my wedding. The day of the trip American Airlines cancelled the flight and put me and my fiancee on a flight 10hrs later (in different seats) when they had other flights available that would've got us there sooner. After they flew us to our connecting flight they delayed it another hour. I normally fly with Southwest I will never make the mistake of flying American Airlines again.
4916,Flew Amsterdam - Orlando - Miami. There are many signs that Arkefly is simply not a proper airline but just a charter operator. It goes beyond the nickle and diming that other airlines do although Arkefly takes it to a new level. The fun started a day before flying: a text message that the plane would be departing two hours late. On with the seat assignments: you have to pay for those and in a strange move you can't check in online unless you paid for a seat. At the check-in counter they had to call operations for a half hour to get me a seat only for me to find out on the plane it didn't exist. The other thing I found is that the plane was quite old (no proper overhead luggage storage) and seats were cramped old and hard as a rock. Charter flight so lots of really loud crying kids. Up to you if you mind. I flew economy comfort leg room is pretty good. As others mention everything has to be paid for except one meal and drink. No complaints there I knew that was the case and I feel that prices were reasonable. By the way don't bother to pay for IFE the selection is pretty useless. Less palatable was the fact that we were significantly delayed due to two passengers being not being admitted to the US at Orlando (stopover en-route to Miami) who were promptly put back on the plane to fly to Miami and onward to Amsterdam. If Arkefly would do passengers pre-checks in Amsterdam like grown-up airlines this wouldn't have happened.
4917,It is a terrible airline. I flew from Amsterdam to Sanford Orlando. The seats were just terrible. You have to pay for everything. I flew comfort and I expected to have more extras then economy but it was just the same. You only get one meal and water. If you would like a snack or just a coke you will pay for it. I couldn't sit properly in my seat I had to turn myself and lay on my side. Because otherwise I would have been seated at my fellow passengers lap. I do not recommend this airline. And please do not consider to upgrade your flight it isn't worth it. The crew is very unprofessional and will help you with nothing. It's all self service.
4918,"Orlando Sanford - Amsterdam September 27 2013. We flew back to Amsterdam with a 767-300 with winglets. The service on board of the personnel is professional. Legroom in Economy too. We reserved seats in the middle row they have the same leg room as economy comfort the latter is more expensive and has nothing more to offer than economy. The problem with this airline is not the legroom but the seat width. 16"" is way too narrow for such a long flight. We two adult males (5'11"") who sport a lot not overweight sat shoulder to shoulder. We had to move our body the whole time because the seats are extremely narrow. People at the window seats had less legroom but can rest against the window so they had more comfort. The narrow seats made the flight very tiring and stressing. We knew Arkefly is cheap but we didn't expect this. They cram one extra seat in width so instead of a normal 2-3-2 you get a 2-4-2 A330/787 setup in a narrow 767. Together with having to pay for every drink or additional food this made a very uncomfortable flight. Even the coffee had to be paid for only water was for free but that tap was next to the toilets and looked dirty with calcium attached. So despite the professionalism of the cabin crew we will never ArkeFly again. We read somewhere Arke is going to cram also an extra seat in de 787 like this. Their 787 goes from 2-4-2 to 3-3-3 777 setup. Horrible! In the end with paying extra for drinks and food and reserving a seat we were better off with United or Delta."
4919,The newer American Airlines triple 7 with the 2-5-2 seating configuration is a very uncomfortable in economy class. On a recent flight from Buenos Aires to Dallas/Ft. Worth my legs were touching the seat in front of me and so were my wife's. I am about 6 feet and my wife is 5'8. The American 767 from Dallas/Ft. Worth to San Francisco had more leg room. I do not recommend long haul flights in the triple7 in the 2-5-2 configuration.
4920,I no longer fly American. I was Platinum for 12 years but I can no longer deal with their customer service their change fees and their attitudes. Flying on American is tough enough but if you have an American Eagle leg in your trip you are likely to face delays slow baggage service and attitudes that are even worse than that of other American employees. Eagle will also tend to push your price up I have chosen to speak with my wallet and to stop giving AA my money.
4921,Very bad flight experience. Though I was booked in Business Class the seats and taking care of food preference was horrible. My in seat entertainment system was not working. Also on top of it the control to call the attendant was not working. Even the reading light on the seat was not working for a major portion of the flight I could not read anything. I had in advance booked an Asian Vegetarian meal. I was informed that the meal had not been arranged. My seat was moving I was not sure that the seat was fully in upright position at the time of take off and landing.
4922,Flight Amsterdam - Kos. I booked premium comfort class. Because of technical problems they changed planes. I didn't get the premium comfort extra's I had paid for. They had no solutions with a bad service.
4923,Definitely the worst option. No frills works for flights less than 2 hours only. Transatlantic on an older smaller plane with very limited entertainment and food options is not worth the savings. By the time you pay for all the luggage fees seat fees and food/entertainment your savings go from $200 to $100 (approx). Also you won't get any miles on your credit card or miles on your preferred airline because they only accept wire transfers! Forget to mention that the wire costs are $40-$50.
4924,This airline is the worst for transatlantic flights in my opinion. I took a flight to Natal Brazil this February. The airline charges for everything ??0 for a personal entertainment kit (otherwise no TV for 9.5 hours!) ??5 to be able to get an assigned seat ??50 for a Coca Cola only water coffee and tea is free of charge. No blanket only one meal served. I don't have a problem with airlines charging for extras - what Arkefly calls extras would be included standard in every other transatlantic airline. Furthermore the seats are terrible I booked their Comfort Class which is just as small as economy in any other airline. No priority boarding etc the only extra I got was a ?? headphone to listen to the radio. I personally think that Arkefly uses the same planes as they would on a flight within Europe. Those are just not up to standard if you have a 9.5 hrs flight to Brazil!
4925,"This is a comment about the ""new"" American Airlines (American/USAir). My wife daughter and 15 month grandson flew USAir Express from Washington National to Louisville yesterday for a special occasion. They took off more than 2 hours late because of a broken toilet on the commuter airline (USAir Express). Today they were scheduled to fly back on American Eagle from Lousville to Washington National on a 1.25pm flight. First flight was delayed until 3.30pm and now cancelled with no alternative until tomorrow. So now they are driving back. We will do everything in our power to avoid flying the ""new"" American."
4926,Went to Miami with Arkefly. Premium Comfort was good for the price back home comfort class was also good and no delays. I read all the reviews and was nervous but everything was fine. It's not very expensive so don't expect too much.
4927,Amsterdam to Mombasa. Paid extra for comfort class and was given the row in front of the emergency exit where the seats could not recline at all. Therefore even worse comfort than sitting in economy class.
4928,Since the Star class was changed into Premium Comfort the level went down dramatically less space between the chairs much smaller seats. Especially on long haul it is two steps back but price is almost the same level. Staff friendly and helpful.On European flights the additional money between comfort class and premium comfort is a waste.
4929,Can not believe they tout new planes yet can't have a consistent onboard experience. I fly 2 to 3 times a week on AA and I never know what my flight will entail. Poor options for entertainment. If you are lucky enough to have internet on a flight you may or may not have the ability to rent a movie or show which I am happy to do. Yet I get on the new airbus which honestly is just as bad as their ancient md-80's and I can either stare at the broken monitor I was given where the sound doesn't work or like the passenger next me the screen was completely broken and would not display correctly. I get on gogo and it won't allow me to rent anything yet surf on a slow and labored internet connection. How can you not bring a consistent options to those that fly you the most?
4930,Flew from AMS to Aruba still have to make the return flight Monday not looking forward to this at all - although at least we have comfort class for the return flight-Row 27. Arrived at Schipol early to avoid traffic delays etc could not check bags in despite already having checked in online once at boarding gate no system no control just a big mess. On the plane we had the last row of seats these hardly reclined at all with little room in front this was no fun for 10 hours. Paid online in advance for entertainment yet had to wait for more than an hour for it to be turned on due to our last row seat - choice of films not good at all. Crew very overworked and did not care at all. Gangway between seats so narrow that if you sat in aisle seat you had constant knocks from crew or passengers walking up and down. No mention that flight would stop in Curacel then got turfed off the plane had to go through customs then queue again to get back on-free seating for this last part of the flight also. Storage was poor on lockers had one of bags placed at the other end of the plane and due to narrow aisle was very hard to get to as the aisle blocked by staff So for the return lest hope Comfort class and row 21 proves better? Thinking of upgrade to Premium Comfort but not sure it is worth it?
4931,"Short flight from TLV-AMM. Check-in agents friendly and courteous. Flight boarded from a bus driven from a ground-level gate that was very warm. Seats were small, overhead lockers dirty with scratches and seat covers had seen better days. Flight attendants passed out crackers after we boarded then gave out water inflight. We arrived about 15 minutes early and were bused into the terminal at AMM. I would fly again only because their schedule allowed me to leave TLV at 5.30pm and arrive in AMM before sundown. However, I would think twice about connecting over TLV, the transit area was closed when I arrived, and I had to stand in line for over an hour at passport control to go check in upstairs."
4932,AA does not care about its customers or understand why getting customers to their destinations on time matters. AA Flight number 132 was cancelled after sitting on the plane for 40 minutes due to a mechanical issue with the aircraft. The AA flight crew knowingly boarded the entire flight of passengers even though they knew the black box/communication box to the flight deck tower was broken and required repair. Many passengers had a connecting flight out of Dallas Fort Worth airport the destination for AA Flight 132. After 30 minutes of waiting with no information the flight crew informed us that the plane had a mechanical issue and the repair was being made. 10 minutes later the flight crew announced that the repair could not be made and the plane would be decommissioned. Asked to de-plane and had to wait another 10 minutes. Finally landed in Dallas. I ran through the airport and we were able to make the second flight (not our originally scheduled flight) and we made it. Flight attendants on this flight (AA Flight number 2467) were not helpful. No crew member helped us move overhead bags to get our bags up or helped communicate to another passenger to move his jacket down or a small bag that should be under such passengers seat. We finally landed in Los Angeles. We lost the chance to get to Honolulu on Saturday February 8 as planned and paid for. After waiting in line we received our voucher for one night at the airport Holiday Inn in Los Angeles and a $39.00 voucher for dinner for 3 people and an $18 voucher for breakfast on Sunday Feb. 9 also for 3 people (in LAX!).
4933,They have a new policy that no seat must be left empty yet their planes have rows of 3 seats. So if you are travelling with a group of 2 you are not allowed to sit next together as long as there are free single places or you are willing to pay 100 euros extra. There is nothing premium about their premium class. Unfortunately if you are flying from The Netherlands you have no other option for most tourist locations.
4934,Unfortunately Star Class has been replaced by so called 'Premium Class'. Flying from AMS to Natal/BRA return it was not a good experience. Seats are small and uncomfortable food very average and full plane had to do with 3 toilets. There was one near the 'premium' area that resulted in continuous queues of waiting travelers in the aisle. Flying back my partner and I wanted to ensure seats near one another and for that we had to pay extra! The service level does not at all equal Star class. I need to look for another airline flying NL-Brasil.
4935,TLV-CDG. The plane was supposed to leave at 1.20 pm but a combination of security delays and plane problems (the plane's electricity supply shut off suddenly during the safety video showing) had us leave the terminal at around 1.45. That was deemed to be too late for a take off as Ben Gurion airport shuts off every night. We were brought back to the crowded terminal area where we slept on the floor on a cramped area with only one restroom and finally left at 5 am. Only a very few apologies very clumsy ones at that were addressed to the passengers. Food was cadaverous (a soft drink and a disgusting-looking plastic-wrapped sandwich). No compensation for the incident I will never fly with them again.
4936,AA 1122 - horrible plane. Seats were extremely uncomfortable even though the seat next to me was not occupied. If you ever have a choice - never choose this flight from Bogota to Dallas. The in-your-face screen in my seat did not work! None of the crew cared about it.
4937,I flew from Orlando to Amsterdam in premium comfort class. The flight was actually pretty good. It was on time convenient priced right service was good and the food not too bad. If you compare it to the major long haul carriers ie Delta Lufthansa Virgin etc you will find some areas that do not compare..ie the seats only recline they do not lie flat no power for computers older planes and basic service is offered not over the top like some carriers. I would recommend this carrier as a low cost alternative to the big airline companies.
4938,We paid over $600 from Tel Aviv to Barcelona and got nothing but a drink. They also didn't accommodate our requests regarding travelling with a child. The crew were not nice the hostess was bitter and not helpful. We will never fly with them again. It is preposterous to pay such high fare for a charter and not even get a bag of pretzels.
4939,TLV-KOS Island Greece-TLV. Full B757-300 each way. 1 hour 20 minutes ride. Crew very efficient in distributing a chocolate muffin and a glass of water to all 270 passengers. Then they sat down in their crew rest seats which where in row 3 smack between passengers and enjoyed a full hot breakfast. You would expect them to eat discreetly in their Galley. They then sold duty free which has great deals. On this portion of the trip it seemed like passengers were unwelcome. On the return flight the crew were more dedicated to service. Again duty free sales. All announcements friendly and clear good Hebrew and English. Nothing amazing nothing horrible. They just went through the motions.
4940,This was our first and last time will be flying with AA first with the 2 hour delay that wasn't their fault but we did not get a phone call like other passengers there was no cabin crew when we boarded the plane nor did they do cabin check (both journeys). We asked about upgrading to business class we were told it was full yet there were some empty seats and 2 of the cabin crew were in them. My mother and I both paid Â£75 each for extra leg room yet the 2 sat next us (both journeys again) said they didn't. Boeing 757 UK to JFK several other passengers also complained about how unhelpful the cabin crew were. Will not recommend this service plus delayed 1 hour coming back.
4941,"Economy PAP-Ft Laud-Dallas-YVR. First leg ok - on time and crew fine. Got caught in Ft Laud customs grubby facility more than 2 hours to get to an officer (5 on duty) - but US Citizens breezed through their own line while the rest of us shuffled forward. I politely mentioned I was going to miss my connection (no sympathy) and was told ""be quiet and stay in line."" Got to baggage claim and another massive line to leave - AA agent tried to rescue me and was rudely treated by customs and I was put back in line (I said nothing). From there on a gong show with AA - later and later flights missed connections no one to help at the gates sent into a line for help and told ""we are closing - sorry"" leave security and come back in and see if an AA check-in is open. Got some polite help from one AA staff - ended up stuck overnight. Next leg to Vancouver in a brand new plane with TVs in the seat (I am used to that on Air Canada) - many passenger asked for - PA announced ""this is a new plane we don't know how to operate the TVs either - if you need help ask a young person they might know."" Cabin crew were surly and short with very polite passengers. Never ever AA again! Arrival customs in YVR in spacious and attractive area with passport scanners and pleasant officers."
4942,Toronto to Amsterdam return. Bird was caught in engine upon take off. After in the air for 45 minutes to offload fuel safe landing back at Schiphol. The flight was only delayed four hours. Water served upon landing as we had to wait 30 minutes in the plane. Very impressed with service for such a low cost airline.
4943,Flight to Curacao in economy class. I never had such a bad flight with unfriendly staff. The one free meal was bad for the rest you have to pay. Seat was very narrow. For menever again with Arkefly.
4944,I am still not a big fan of AA but it looks like that they are now working harder to provide to their pax some kind of decent flight experience. Flew recently SJO-MIA-DEN/RT. On SJO-MIA still operating the old 757 but with a refurbished cabin at least. MIA-DEN newish 737-800. Nice aircraft. Ground handling efficient and friendly. They assigned me an exit row and main cabin exit seats for free without asking. All pilots talked to the pax providing a lot of flight info. The winner was the 757 Captain of the flight MIA-SJO. After appreciating his clients over the mike he also took the time to bid a farewell to every pax exiting the plane with a Thank You and a smile. Even though their inflight service still leaves a lot to wish it is a nice manner to show each passenger the value they deserve. Overall a good experience and I'll fly AA again.
4945,Chicago to Dubai Frequent Flyer on American via LH. Been a loyal customer since the 1980's. It's really a shame how this airline has degraded. The planes I fly are always really old virtually no entertainment system at all if it even works there's no leg room and seats are often old smelly and sometimes broken. On one flight the bathroom floor was cracked. Staff are always great but they have a really poor product to work with and their frustration shows. After all these years finally had enough will be checking out from American after next flight such a shame.
4946,DFW-SEA in new 737 which was refreshing compared to previous AA flights on old planes however the new seats are cramped and feel more uncomfortable than older aircraft. In seat VOD is a huge improvement however it appears that AA will be charging for this in future along with earphones and food. Another downside is that the screen does not adjust. Even with the seat in front not reclined the viewing angle for a person of average height is poor and soon results in a neck ache. There is the question of service or more particularly lack there-of and attitude. This flight was no exception and service was delivered abruptly and with only occasional customer respect. I asked for a cup of tea (complimentary) and was given a cup of hot water and a tea bag on the side. With AA it's a case of get on board (sometimes you're welcomed other times you're not) sit down pay for everything other than basics (and if you want water mid flight go get it but be sure to ask permission if you're not interrupting the staff talking to each other at the back) don't complain then get off (and you might get thanked for your custom from an FA who might be sat on one of the seats - although at least the Captain often thanks you). On the plus side this flight was very punctual and baggage delivered quickly but that speaks more to the efficiency of others.
4947,CUR-AMS comfort class on B767. Seat very narrow and no support. Legroom ok. Food one free meal was really bad and a small portion - no salad or desert or bread roll. Seat was not working would not recline! Nothing could be done staff did not seem to care. All other food and drink for sale during the flight - quality of food again pretty low. Staff friendly but goes thru the motions.
4948,Amsterdam-Cancun (stopover Varadero). The trip started with a delay of already 3.5 hrs. Once in the air service not too friendly. Food very poor quality (one meal free one drink free I took 1 litre of water extra with me) seats very cramped even in 'Comfort' Class - comfort that's a joke!. In Cuba it became clear that there was something wrong with the engine - 'Don't worry it's totally safe to fly on to CancÃºn but regulations make us perform a repair' - you don't feel very safe when they say this. We got off the plane and spent a couple of hrs. at the airport - good cheap beer and cigars. We left Cuba with a total of 5.5.hrs delay. 'To make up for the delay we offer all passengers a free cup of water' the purser said - very funny and of course totally inadequate.
4949,Flight Zurich to JFK. Very old 767 plane - 21 years - showing excessive wear and tear. Dirty torn carpets and seat covers. Such an old and poorly maintained plane does not feel safe. No entertainment system other than a shaky old style TV hung from the ceiling. No magazines or newspapers provided (other than the thin airline's magazine). Food quality was average - liquor costs extra. The only commendable thing was the friendly crew and the fact that the plane was at most half full. Apparently the word about these run down planes has spread and few people choose AA on a route which also has a direct flight from Swiss. AA terminal at JFK is catastrophic. Luggage takes almost an hour to arrive and when departing the wait time at security was exceeded 90 minutes.
4950,"MAN-JFK. Used Oneworld (BA) reward miles. I had the lowest expectations having flown AA many times in the past both business and pleasure although not for some years. Check-in and security were the usual Manchester Airport slick and fast why can't Heathrow learn from them? On boarding we were met by a smiling and effusive purser who was greeting every passenger. Don't know if my BA Gold Card had anything to do with it but we were seated just behind Business in extra leg room seats. Yes the plane was an antique and had no seat back entertainment which almost beggars believe but it was clean and all seats and trays appeared to work for AA an achievement! We departed on time and arrived on time. We were served the preposterously named ""International Flagship"" lunch which was actually not bad for economy. Apart from the excellent purser the cabin crew went through the motions but were not rude or bad tempered which is a major improvement. US immigration was fast and the staff actually smiled. AA cabin crew and US immigration staff smiling what is the world coming to? Overall we were pleasantly surprised and would use again for the benefit of flying direct."
4951,From reading the list of reviews I don't understand why anyone would fly with American Airlines I however am military and am forced to fly what is given to me. Today 21 Feb14 flying on orders from San Antonio to Fort Walton Beach I was forced to pay to have my baggage checked for the first time in 8 years. I fly often and usually have 1 to 2 bags that weigh from 60 to 100lbs and have never been asked to pay. AA seems to have different requirement on baggage weights from state to state. I had no problem with baggage fees leaving Fort Walton but was charged 125 dollars on my return flight departing San Antonio.
4952,Amsterdam to Cancun via Holguin/Cuba. Very cheap upgrade from Economy Class to Comfort Class. Worn out seats but offering extra legroom and moveable headrests. Crew very friendly. On the downside only radio channels are free - no video entertainment on main screens. But you could rent a DVD-player for 12 Euro extra total rip off! Also only one meal with drinks after take-off is for free after that everything except water has to be paid for. Arkefly is a good company but this pay-for-everything extra like low cost model is not working on long haul flights.
4953,Amsterdam-Bonaire return in Comfort Class. We have checked-in online so supposed to just drop off our bags at a special desk. Arkefly makes a mess of thnigs. There is no drop off point and we have to get in line with all the other passengers for three different flights. Only three positions open. Aircraft is worn tv screens do not work properly. Service friendly but mediocre. Almost everything but the one evening meal has to paid for. Food is extremely bad. Wine is awful. We paid specifically for seats with extra leg room. After a short lay over on CuraÃ§ao. The seating becomes free for the passengers that have to get off at the next stop Bonaire so we loose our seats for the last half hour of our flight.
4954,Holland to Jamaica return in Star Class Arkefly's equivalent of Business Class. Both flights departed over 2.5 hours late our seats still had the previous passenger's meal remainders. Planes are very very old. Staff friendly food is average but reasonable for charter. We wouldn't fly this airline again.
4955,March 2014 AA 39 London Heathrow to Miami. AA2438 Miami to San Jose. 16th April 2014 AA 353 San Jose to Miami. AA38 Miami to London Heathrow. Haven't even travelled with AA yet but already we are thoroughly disillusioned. Have travelled business class with many different airlines over the decades and never experienced such disregard. For personal reasons we need a window seat and aisle so the moment we book a flight we go online and book our seats. These are always without fail honoured. But American Airlines have already thrown us out of our pre-books seats 3 times relocating us in inappropriate seats and separated! Each time we have re-books seats but today find they have moved us again and suddenly all other seats are full! We phoned only to be told that they were not prepared to move other passengers despite them being single travellers even though they had moved us three times without reference to our wishes. We are no longer looking forward to our journey and will be avoiding AA in the future.
4956,Flight 2048 MIA to JFK Feb 15th in Coach extra. JFK was recovering from a snow-storm but that doesn't forgive the appalling service delivered by AA to passengers stuck for 8 hours on what should be a 3-hour flight. 1 hour late departure ATC orders no blame. 45 minutes holding pattern somewhere off the coast around DC a further delay. Running out of fuel so we have to land in Philadelphia. Quick refuel and push-back only to stop halfway through because the tow-bar has broken. Then return to the gate for one passenger to deplane no explanation but efficiently and quickly done. Land at JFK at 10.45 pm. No gate held on taxiway get assigned gate but access blocked by de-icing an outbound plane assigned another gate so taxi a couple of hundred yards then stop. Eventually move to gate but another 15-minute delay. Eventually get to the gate and disembark at 12.30 am. Wait for baggage is interminable and at first there is no information as to which carousel it's coming on. I get mine at about 1.50 am and that's marked Priority. In 8 hours on the plane there was one drinks service no additional refreshment except for a hand-out of an oat bar. Inadequate communication from the flight deck as to what was happening once we'd landed at JFK. Appalling behaviour and lack of customer care.
4957,Business Class from Dublin to JFK. Not a great service at all. When we got on the plane the pre-flight drinks were sitting on the table of one of the business class seats. Everything rushed. Hostesses do just the bare minimum required. Earphones faulty. Had them changed and the new ones didn't work. Turns out the socket for the earphones in my seat was broken. So no inflight entertainment for me for the whole flight unless I was prepared for visuals only. Then got a cup of coffee in a filthy cup. Admirals Lounge in JFK is a joke. Pretzels cheese carrots apples some juice and coffee. That's it. You have to pay for anything else at airport prices. Then they looked for $10.50 for a glass of wine. I thought the girl behind the bar was joking. She wasn't. She reluctantly told me that one wine was complimentary and she begrudgingly served it. How can they justify charging Business prices and provide such a sub-standard product? Will never fly with them again.
4958,We traveled Jan 15 - Feb. 14. Our plane was delayed for an hour in LA and another 45 minutes in Chicago. There were only a few snacks available on our flight the TV didn't work properly and when we got home to Flint MI our luggage wasn't there and there was no reason for this because we had to wait for an hour on the tarmac before taking off.
4959,Would not recommend flying American. Yesterday morning I called their customer service/flight status line and requested the status of my flight from Cleveland to Charlotte. The automated system told me it was on time and after I selected the option even texted me a copy of the status stating the same thing. I drove to the airport paid to park went to the counter to check my bag and the counter clerk who was quite rude and non-empathetic said your flight was cancelled yesterday. Meanwhile I receive a call from my wife who says she received a call at home stating my connecting flight out of Charlotte had been delayed but the counter clerk had already told me that flight was cancelled too. No call was ever made to tell me either flight had been canceled. I am sure they would like to blame this on the merger or maybe even the severe weather and quantity of flight cancellations but that is nonsense.
4960,"Asiana did not check its aircraft's conditions and status until the last minute, after all the passengers were aboard. Turned out that there was a problem with the plane, which they failed to identify and fix for the next 3 hours. The aircraft took off 3 whole hours after it was supposed to, and in the mean time all the passengers were close to suffering from a heat exhaustion, because they wouldn't turn the A/C on until we were up in the air. There were no real refreshments (other than small cups of drinks) during the three hour period either. Why couldn't they have checked the plane beforehand so that 1) we could've left on time, 2) we could've taken another aircraft, 3) or at least if neither of those options were possible, we could have waited in the terminal where we could at least walk around and get food. There were no compensations of any kind made by the airline to their customers, the only reason I don't give the airline a 0/10 review is because their on-the-ground-workers were swift in helping people get to their next connecting flight."
4961,"Flew 2/9/2014 from St. Martin to IAH changing in Miami. We were in the first part (""extra legroom"" section) of the Main Cabin. On the first leg AA was sold out of Meals for Purchase by Row 11. (Dozens of rows behind - no food upset travelers). During the 3 hour calm flight attendants came down the row once to offer a beverage. Zero customer service. Extremely unpleasant crew. During the Miami layover had to retrieve luggage due to Customs. Plane landed at 6.42pm. Got our luggage at 8.05pm! Others still waiting after us. Baggage Claim personnel gave zero customer service. On the second leg into IAH attendants told everyone that someone forgot to put any liquor/beer on the flight. And again attendants came down the aisle once during the 2.5hr flight to offer a beverage (juice water soda only). Zero customer service. AA has a long ways to go in the Customer Service department."
4962,2/9/14 LAX to Chicago. I am extremely disappointed with American Airlines customer service. Staff were unfriendly and rude during the boarding and ticketing process. During the check-in process I received a message that I had not chosen a seat and was asked to pay an additional $68 for an upgraded seat. From the mobile phone the check-in process could not be completed until this upgrade was purchased. At the airport during the self check-in it was clear a seat had been chosen and no upgrade was needed at that time. Why are the two systems not compatible with each other? During boarding they allowed all passengers to board who did not have roller bags. This then resulted in less space for these roller bags during the boarding process. Flight attendant's allowed customers to place small bags and coats in the overhead compartments. When it came time to board the roller bags there was not enough room for these bags. This could have been avoided had the staff asked these other customers to please remove smaller items and place under the seat. Instead they were then rude to those with roller bags who did not have enough space accusing them of delaying the flight further. This seems like a rather inefficient process and one that should be reviewed to provide better customer service to those flying on American.
4963,"ORD to IAH. Check in was a bit of a hassle since the American Airlines staff directed us to a machine kiosk that was malfunctioning. After that hurdle was crossed a slew of others slowly came our way. Our original flight to IAH Houston was scheduled for 3.15pm at 2.55pm (local time) and arriving at 5.55pm the gate attendant told us that the flight had been delayed for an unspecified amount of time. We soon learned that the gate had been changed no announcement by telecom only by looking at the airport television screens did we figure this out. The new departure time was 3:34pm but that didn't happen either so the staff delayed the flight again to 4.04pm. As 4.15pm approached everyone was finally seated on this haggard and small CR7 jet. As we were about to leave the gate the pilot said there needed to be some maintenance and that it would take ""5 minutes"" to complete. 5 minutes passed and then 10 and then 20. By this time it was 4.25pm and we had yet to leave the gate. At 4.45pm we began taxing onto the runway when another problem arose. There apparently was an electrical failure and maintenance needed to be done once again. Back to the gate we go and by now its 5.10pm. Maintenance fixed the problem and off we go! We finally take off at 5.45pm."
4964,"The negative experience begins with the challenge of buying a ticket. Their website is difficult to navigate. Flight information is presented in a confusing manner. The best part is trying to reserve a seat. Knowing where you will sit prior to arriving at the departure airport is an important part of the travel experience. This is especially true when flying for 12 hours. Evidently, Asiana does not believe this is important and therefore will not allow 50% of ticketed passengers on their flights to reserve a seat. Instead, seat assignment takes place upon arrival at the airport. Asiana attempts to make up for the 'inconvenience' with a competent staff, but the inefficiency and uncertain seat assignment overwhelms their effort. Other carriers offer a significantly better experience."
4965,DFW-BOG on A319: Feb 7th. This aircraft should not fly internationally. Not on a 5-hour route anyway. First class is a complete joke with only 2 rows. The bulkhead is extraordinarily uncomfortable and the last and second row simply horrible as seat cannot recline because it is placed physically against the partition between first and coach cabins. Entertainment? Lots of options If the controls work (I was in two seats and none worked properly). All these in addition to an over two-hours delay (excused by the nasty weather in the USA the last couple of weeks). What did not have an excuse at all was the extremely dirty plane (bathroom was not even flushed when first passengers boarded). AA flights to Colombia have shown substandard service and equipment for the longest. I hope all the positive changes in AA's culture that have started being evident after the merger with USAirways also benefit USA-Colombia travelers. In the meantime my personal advice to AA's Bogota-bound travelers: do not pay Business or First. AA is generally a good value in the back of the plane but not worth pay premium cabin for a substandard product and service into Bogota. I recommend AA anywhere but Colombia-bound routes.
4966,Flew ICN-SYD in business class - all aspects of this trip and airline seem to have gone downhill since our previous flight on the same route 3+ years ago. Old aircraft with recliner seats in a 2-3-2 configuration - as far as I know this is the only OZ long haul route without newer lie-flat seats in business class. Even though business class was only 3/4 full Asiana would not allocate us seats in the window/aisle seats until airport check-in. We were the last people in the cabin who had their meal order taken and they had run out of western meals - only Korean left for one of us. They did have the main courses left so my husband was offered a steak (no appetiser) served with chopsticks. My main course (fish) was terrible - took one bite and left the rest. Champagne was room temperature and breakfast eggs were cold - why can't airlines serve cold things cold and hot things hot - it's not that hard. Lounge in ICN is looking somewhat worn out and F&B offerings are rock bottom. Last flight for us on this airline particularly considering their recent safety record (another landing accident in Japan last week). Finally if one were to judge an airline by the quality of their web site Asiana would get a fail. In the interests of full disclosure this was a *A award flight for us.
4967,FRA-ICN and ICN-SYD return FRA-ICN leg in clean and tidy 747s were comfortable food and service very good seat comfort and legroom felt better than Emirates. ICN-SYD leg on very old and tired 777-ER with terribly uncomfortable seats dirty upholstery and Stone Age inflight entertainment of 5 looped movies on grainy screens - the smiling cabin staff saved the day with constant offers of drinks and responsive service.
4968,Flew Las Vegas - JFK 28 Jan 2014. If it wasn't for our crew the flight would've been miserable all the crew smiled from boarding to landing I was expecting the opposite the Flight attendant looking after us in the front was excellent he was always in the cabin offering drinks and so on only complaint is the seats and IFE after coming off a Virgin America first class flight they are way beyond AA's seats. The food was below par way below par that I couldn't eat it where as I could eat almost anything.
4969,LAX-NRT Economy cabin B777-200. Have to say one of my worst experiences in a very long time. Were told before boarding the IFE was broken so expect no TV for the next 12 hrs. Boarded an old plane with dirty cabins. Blanket and candy wrappers in my/ my wife's seat pockets. To my right on the other side of the aisle there was a lady with an empty seat next to her. She wanted to fold up the armrest so she could sleep across but the armrest would not stay up which was later solved by flight attendants using masking tape. My reading light was broken. American Airlines truly lived up to what US airlines are famous for - grumpy flight attendants shouting at foreign passengers who merely wanted to find out more about the food they were being served. And while on food absolutely horrible and I am sure anyone on that flight would have described it as such. Same chicken and rice dish for both meals but called different names. Same sauce same meat but one with carrots and onions. Not asking for Michelin- starred gourmet meals but this was just miles apart from coach class catering at other airlines I have flown with for example Cathay or Japan Airlines. If they can do it why can't American. Flight attendants delivering service chewing gum. Signs they were getting a tad too relaxed about their work environment. I am a frequent traveller and do not often (in fact my first time) post reviews but I really think flight deserves American's attention.
4970,Have flown AA F GRU-MIA-GRU several times. It is true that AA has pyjamas in First and better linen but still: cabin is always a bit dirty food is pathetic for first class with $8 wines and cheap whisky. Service has improved a bit they try but far from being a real F experience. On arrival especially at GRU priority tags are just part of your luggage decor: I have lost count of how many times I had to wait much more than coach passengers for my bags. The TAM product is far better and as they join Oneworld soon goodbye AA.
4971,"JFK to Heathrow. The flight was needlessly delayed by 3hrs at first not because of any weather or anything but just because it was not ""ready"" yet and then after we were boarded it was again delayed by 2 hrs. After we landed in Heathrow people who missed flights were not given any sort of lodging etc. This is totally unexpected from an international airline which is considered first rate. I write this comment to let people know what they can expect if they plan on a long flight with AA."
4972,Not very good. The flight from Accra to Lome was late. My flight from Lome to Adoula was cancelled. Very poor information from airline management at Lome. No information as to when our flight from Lome to Aduola would be going ahead. In the end we were woken up at 3am in our hotel and told to check out at 4am. Unfortunately the airport at Lome didn't open till 5am so I and everybody else sat around until then. Still when the flight took off we got to Adoula in reasonable time. There seems to be some issues with management control/ passenger information that seriously need addressing.
4973,"Travelled on ASKY from Douala-Bangui. I asked to see my bag prior to it being loaded to verify it was actually there. I was able to see my bag however when I arrived in Bangui I found out it was not loaded along with other passengers baggage. I was told this was because the flight was too full and the baggage was offloaded due to weight. Despite numerous phone calls and emails I still not have received my bag. ASKY agents have shown no interest whatsoever I arrived in Bangui with no other clothing. The flight was booked through Ethiopian Airlines as they claim to be ""partners"" Ethiopian said they cannot help once ASKY receive the bag. I would not recommend this airline to anyone they are arrogant and have no customer service at all!"
4974,SYD to LAX business via ICN. SYD to ICN is on an old Airbus with old business seats which are not very comfortable. Crew are all polite and helpful. Food is average at best as is IFE. The 777 and A380 between ICN and LAX is much nicer but again food and IFE are average. Amenity kit - why do they bother? Also no PJs which are now offered by many airlines. The Air New Zealand lounge at LAX is a highlight.
4975,Flew from Los Angeles to Manila. From LAX to Incheon on their new A380. At check in at LAX I was asked to check my carry on as they said the flight was very full-big mistake as my carry on was not in Manila when I arrived-it was put on a later flight and I had to return to Manila airport two days later to pick it up. Boarding at LAX into the A380 as there are so many passengers is a cattle call. They hold up signs with seat numbers and you have to line up behind the sign with your seat number. I was seated in economy upstairs and was lucky to be in front of the line and boarded reasonably fast. The economy seat on the A380 was better than most seats I have flown on many long haul flights to Asia on United or China Air and I found the entertainment system very good with good movies to watch in English. Flight attendants were efficient and pleasant but nothing special. Food I thought was very good compared to others I have flown and you are given real silverware and not plastic-nice touch. I always try to book an aisle seat which I did on this flight so I could easily get up and stand for a while during the flight. The only problem on the A380 is there is nowhere to go and stand for awhile unless you go to the restroom as compared to the old 747's with space in the back to stand and stretch for awhile. The A380 is a nice quiet plane and I would not hesitate to fly it again on Asiana. International transfer at Incheon airport are a breeze-just follow the signs for transfers and you go through a security check and then right up to the departure area for your next flight. Incheon airport is very clean and modern and all stores and restaurants do accept USA dollars so no need to exchange money to be able to buy something. Flight to Manila was on a older 777-200 which was fine for a much shorter flight-it lands at Terminal 1 in Manila which is the oldest terminal and under construction to improve it right now-leaving from there has improved since I flew from there last year-but barely. Leaving from Manila has always required you to pay a terminal fee as you depart but as of this writing the terminal fee will be included in all ticket prices and you will no longer need to pay the terminal fee when departing Manila. Just wish more airlines flew into the new Terminal 3 in Manila which is much nicer and modern terminal. When leaving Manila Asiana made me check my carry-on as it weighed more than 10 kilos but when I boarded the plane I saw many people with much larger carry-ons than mine which I know weighed more than 10 kilos? I had a camera in the bag so they zip tied every pocket and shrunk wrapped the bag in plastic with a big sign say it was fragile and I arrived with no problems.
4976,Traveled from Barcelona to NY flight # 67 and paid $89 for what we believed were extra legroom seats. Seats were cramped boarded last no space in any nearby bins for hand luggage plane was ancient didn't even have individual air controls. AA states we booked 'preferred seats' which merely allowed us to choose our seats for $89!
4977,I have flown MIA-JFK on an old B767-300. Flight was full. Seat very old but comfortable and pitch was ok. Entertainment only through overhead screens. I was shocked that this aircraft had the new hatrack design only for premium cabins Economy cabin still had the 90's hatrack design which a) looks very old and b) does not have enough room for everyone. Only non-alcoholic drink service for this 2hr flight. Staff very unprofessional. There seems to be an inconsistency in their uniform. One female flight attendant was wearing - what seemed to be her personal apron that featured dozens of US flags next to each other. After landing in JFK we had to hold at a remote stand before our gate was available. As usual passengesr were standing up and retrieving their bags from the overhead bins despite the captain making an announcement to remain seated. No flight attendant took any action only a Captain in American Airlines uniform travelling as a passenger made assertive requests for everyone to remain seated to which everyone then complied. Also saw a male flight attendant making a call on his mobile phone during taxiing to the gate. Very unprofessional!
4978,Ghastly flight in First Class on AA from PVG to LAX. The flight attendants were very nice. The seat was horrible. Uncomfortable. Had really poor leather padding a very weird need to press a latch under the arm of the seat first in order to operate seat controls. When in the bed/sleep position the seat had a bulging ridge in the middle hinge that made it impossible to lie on. There was no privacy because the seats had no enclosures or partial walls just wide open so that all the lights noise smells of the cabin were omnipresent. Bad lighting tiny hard to move video screen dirty floor cheap broken plastic laminate console patched poorly with silicon putty etc. It was like a really bad business class. Actually I've flown several times in AA's sub marginal business class and as bad as they are the seat padding is actually superior to the first class seats. Guess anyone who tolerates this service has never flown Cathay Pacific. Their biz class is outstanding. Every seat with an aisle seats constructed to provide lots of privacy good lighting headphones mirror private cabinet lots of room really comfortable lie flat seat. I used 67.5 thousand miles for my lousy AA flight.
4979,We have travelled from Heathrow to Sydney and return with Asiana before and also with other airlines. Last time we rated Asiana as very good. Sadly this time the overall level of service was much lower. We had booked through a reputable online travel agency and had a terrible job of getting our seats allocated through them. We eventually got them confirmed but there were a couple of changes along the way. As there is a 19 hour layover at Seoul on the return leg Asiana had previously provided hotel accommodation. We had expected a similar facility this time but after booking we found that not to be the case and we had to make our own arrangements. The flights themselves were uneventful. The seats were comfortable and all four flights were about on time although at least one of the Boeings was quite old. There was a certain amount of turbulence on each flight but the aircraft dealt with that and we suffered no real discomfort. We didn't however think that the meals were as good as previously and certainly the in flight entertainment was quite limited. Perhaps as could be expected there appeared to be more Korean music and films. Unlike their ground staff colleagues the flight crew were very helpful and polite. Most but not all spoke very good English. Our low rating for staff service is due entirely to the way we were dealt with by staff at Seoul. We would not discount using Asiana again but we will as ever consider our experience on this flight with those we experienced with other 5 star airlines when selecting flights in future and we would recommend travellers to look at Asiana as well as other airlines.
4980,American Airlines flight 940 on January 3 2014 in Economy from Santiago Chile to Miami. No personal TV like most foreign airlines no headphones available (only for sale) wine and beer for sale only only one choice of meal flight attendants who don't look presentable no free copy of the Wall Street Journal or local business newspaper no after dinner spirits no ear plugs and eye shades and the seat pocket in front had trash from the previous passenger. The aircraft must have been one of the oldest I've flown in years. I will continue avoiding AA as much as I can.
4981,ORD-LHR on 12/01/14 (QR 5288 - Qatar Airways code share). Flown AA many times overall impression has never been wonderful - usually met expectations though. This flight however was a shocker. Clapped out 767. Old CRT screens from the 90's hanging from the ceilings. Each one in the cabin had a different colour tinge. Meals were ok nothing to rave or complain about. Hostesses were surly with a bad attitude. Passenger next to my wife asked for a cup of coffee and my wife very politely asked for a cup of tea as well. Hostess snapped that she couldn't remember two things at once. Very unimpressive crew about as friendly as rattlesnakes.
4982,Currently flying from Boston to Austin (via Dallas) on AA. Flights have been on time and aircraft condition is not bad. However we are flying with our 3 year old twins who are actually very good travelers and have found that AA is not family friendly at all. They do not offer any pre boarding for families with small children. We travel with carseats for the kids because we find that this keeps them calm and contained throughout the flight a benefit for all on board but this takes a few minutes for us to put into the seats when we get on the plane and is incredibly difficult to do with many other travelers simultaneously boarding. So when they oddly did not call families for pre boarding on this flight we went up to the front during one of the many other pre boarding categories (carrying our carseats and our tired kids walking) and asked if we could pre board. We were told that we could not that others had paid for this service and we would have to wait on the side. We waited as instructed and when we got on we found that most of the plane had somehow already boarded and it was extremely difficult to get set up. We got no offers of help from any staff members. This is the least family friendly airline we have ever flown hope we won't ever have to fly it again - we fly a lot even with the kids will try to avoid AA in the future. Also in flight entertainment was broken on our of our flights.
4983,"BCN-MIA on AA 113 26 December in economy. Plane - 767 - dirty scruffy and well used. No seat back screens and on the overhead screens the first film started before the crew handed out ear phones - they were too busy preparing their sleeping quarters. Food dismal and when I went to the galley to ask for some water I was told ""Wait 10 minutes and we will be round"". But the main issue was safety. No pre take off safety check and on landing 2 emergency exit rows I could see were full of luggage on the floor the occupants on one had ear phones in and their Ipads on window blinds were shut and all this less than 2 metres away from a steward. Disgraceful. The staff were the worst I have ever had and to top it all they took 3 days to deliver our luggage. Never again will I fly with American. If I could give a zero rating I would."
4984,Seoul Incheon - London Heathrow 4/1/2015. The flight was delayed by almost an hour taking off and so we were late into London missed our slot and had to circle for another 20mins. The food was truly awful if it wasn't tasteless it was far too spicy. My main gripe was with the 'entertainment system'. On a 12 hr flight we had the choice of 6 films on a loop of 2hrs you would think that we would at least have had AVOD or a better choice than what we had. I only watched 2 films as nothing else appealed. I have travelled with Asiana before and was fairly satisfied but I am afraid the service is not what it was.
4985,"MIA-JFK on 7/1/2014 on AA 1510. As with my 2 previous reports dreadful staff who did no safety checks and again blinds down and some setbacks not up. A dismal old dirty plane - 757 - which must have been 20-30 years old. No info provided prior to landing 're connections and when I asked how to get from T8 to T7 was told ""ask in the terminal"". I was so pleased that our final leg was with BA. And to cap it all American lost my Wife's luggage again. Why BA and other airlines have codeshare arrangements with this dismal appalling airline is beyond me."
4986,SKB-MIA 27/12/2013 on AS 1009. Poor service with no safety checks on take off or landing. Luggage in emergency exit rows and blinds down. We landed 25 minutes early but then had to wait over 1 hour to hook on to the terminal. On dismantling (it was at night) all the lights went out. The crew did nothing no torches at all and to cap it all they were laughing. AA never again.
4987,"MAD-DFW Business: Every single aspect of the flight is mediocre and lagging well behind competition. Tatty 767-300ER with 90s interior (claustrophobic even in Business). Caution: if you assume that travelling Business means you can relax and board the last on this Madrid-Dallas route you are in for a huge shock. All overhead compartments designed last century are not capable of storing vertically standard 22"" hand carry and as a result they get filled quickly. Crew unhelpful preferring to watch the chaos instead of assisting. Entertainment is only provided by Samsung Galaxy distributed by the Crew but at least the headset is high end (BOSE). Food is the only consolation tasting above average. Did not check any luggage due to fear of losing it at DFW. And here is the final kicker: Admiral lounge at DFW gives you a coupon valid for one drink only the very first time I was treated like a homeless at a Business Lounge. Avoid at all costs."
4988,ORD-ICN-SGN-ICN-ORD on B777s. The ICN-ORD route is unfortunately served by moderately old planes while the SGN-ICN route is served by newer ones with relatively more legroom. Planes are clean; staff is professional (needs better English though) and the food is satisfactory. My pet peeve is about the entertainment system. The screens on the ICN-ORD are small have old formats with no English subtitles (even for non-English movies). The choices are limited though updated with recent stuff. In conclusion OZ is a tad bit better than KE but probably not exactly on par with CX and SQ who are fellow 5-star airlines. Honestly OZ needs to have something similar to CXStudios or KrisWorld better English speakers and needs some work on the Western food.
4989,AA 57 LHR-MIA 31 Dec. Inflight service in First Class seemed friendly enough however the food and beverage suffered by comparison with British Airways. AA serves Dewar's Scotch $20/litre BA Johnnie Walker Blue Label $200/litre. But certainly AA seats while older were lie-flat and comfortable in comparable pods. Where AA fails wretchedly is on the ground in baggage claim and in passing through security in Miami where there is no 'Fast Track' access to ongoing flights. For two years in a row despite flying International First Class with baggage checked and tagged 'Priority' by the international departure airport I waited nearly an hour for the bags in Miami with no American personnel in the baggage claim area to assist and no out source baggage company access to American computers. The result is that a missed or delayed international arriving bag must be reported outside customs and security to AA's baggage service office which does not have access to bags inside customs!
4990,EWR-MIA-SXM. On first leg late arriving aircraft meant a delayed departure and a dirty plane. Flight was saved by excellent FA. Second leg late again no pre departure beverage uninterested FA/crew and filthy bathroom. Food service is rushed and fair at best.
4991,ICN-PVG Business class on an very old B767. Flight attendants were not as attentive as in long-haul flights. Hot meal was served which is not bad for the two hour flight.
4992,LHR-ICN economy. The flight was quite empty - plenty of space to sleep. The cabin temperature was high at least by European or North American standards. Food was quite good. Staff was friendly - price was expensive but was probably related to a one way ticket.
4993,Flight from ICN-KIX and then from NRT to ICN. Both flights on an A333 no IFE during half of the flight because I think the crew just didn't turn it on.. Only one food option when with Korean Air there is 2 food options. The worst part was their ground check in staff at NRT who were so rude.
4994,FRA to DFW on 1/10/14. Wife and children (well behaved and quiet) coming back home. No special meal request. Cabin crew went past them on two occasions once during the beverage service and once during the meal service without stopping to ask if they wanted something to eat or drink. They were not even sleeping. Worse was when my wife called them back the flight attendants acted all surprised that my wife and children actually wanted to eat or drink anything! Yes on a 11 hour flight. Incredible.
4995,Trip from Hamilton Bermuda - JFK-IND on January 2 2014. Flight arrived at JFK at 10.40 am and supposed to take- off to IND at 3 pm. Without any announcement or explanation flight has been delayed until 8pm when snow storm started then airplane was de-iced after which it returned to the gate and pilots left. Passengers were given alternative flights the next day - we got 2 tickets on Delta and told there are no vouchers for the delay. We booked on our own a hotel in NYC and next day all flights were still grounded. AA kept us on the phone for hours until we called Delta who changed the ticket for us and we flew the next day home.
4996,28 Oct FLT OZ 574. Tired old plane. 90 minutes late taking off no explanation offered. The passenger in the next seat just did not fit in his space he intruded into mine. Cabin attendants handed out standard airline food - awful. Three times they offered Korean immigration forms and then just disappeared until just before landing. Immediately on boarding the passengers in the row in front fully reclined their seats. That was possibly the only way they could fit in the space. The inflight entertainment had a scratchy sound. This was the worst airline experience I have had.
4997,SYD-ICN: old plane old reclining seat poor entertainment system with 4 movies playing in 2.5 hour loop Korean meal choice are the same in all flights. Crew service is good but they can't make up for the substandard hard products.
4998,Flew from Recife Brazil to Miami. This airline continues to live up to their reputation that they have earned for being terrible. The check-in experience was such a demonstration of incompetence and bad manners by the counter staff. Both the ground and cabin staff were not helpful and rude. They seriously need to undergo training in customer service. They were 11 passengers in Business class cabin and they'd already run out of Beef and seafood by the time they asked me for my choice of food. The food was very bad. The seat was old and the entertainment system did work for some passengers. The staff disappeared by the time they take away the food.
4999,I travel internationally very frequently on business and holiday. My recent flights with American Airlines between London and New York were the worst in years. Rude unhelpful ground staff a website that wouldn't process seat selections filthy planes and truly disgusting bathrooms. Of the seven different airlines I travelled with in the last 2 months American was the worst. The flight crew were also noisy and talked for hours during an overnight flight. I will not use them again.
5000,As part of a One World American Airlines codeshare with Malaysia Airlines my family and I traveled on AA from West Palm Beach (B737-800) Chicago (B767-300 winglet) London 2 Jan and was completely satisfied despite the delays due to weather in Chicago. 3.5 hours delay in West Palm Beach and another 2.5 hours delay in Chicago. Both flight were packed. The super friendly hospitality of their Cabin Crew made the journey pleasant. The breakfast prior to landing in London was made up of just one tiny croissant and a small cup of yoghurt. Their aircraft's are old and their IFE very ancient. Do not have a high expectation and you will be fine.
